Impulse control,1,mlr1iz,1,How do you deal with poor impulse control?
Advice on Lithium - the wonder drug,1,mlqqod,2,"I started taking lithium 2 years ago and changed my life. I had no bad side-effects,  I'm happy, in control and I lost so much weight I'm now in great shape psychically and mentally.

Thing is I'm terrified of kidney, liver or thyroid problems. I'm so worried about having to deal with any or all of them but at the same time how can I even let go of lithium. I tried a whole bunch of pills before but nothing came even close to the effectiveness of lithium.

Are there any other solutions out there as good as lithium?"
being manic like,18,mlq0av,3,
Mixed episodes and denying the intensity of your feelings.,3,mlpzxq,1,"Not sure where to start so I will pick here. Right now I feel like letting every manic urge I'm feeling just fucking run wild. Most of that was drinking, lots of meaningless sex with random girls, spending money I don't have, drugs, starting 15 new projects at once.

Slight TL;DR: Took psych evals and they didn't show up as bipolar. My brain constantly thinks things like ""hey you can't be that depressed because other people are more depressed and kill themselves"". So I answer slightly depressed. These evals were after I went to the ER so I didn't kill myself. 

Now onto my story/problem.. I was reading and something said to not compare yourself to others in regards to things in life because your feelings only need to be validated by how they make you feel. I may be poor compared to someone like those three richest guys but that doesn't matter. I make decent money and am shit at budgeting. I feel poor because I have more than enough and I can't make it work properly. I feel anxiety really bad, I'm sweating having trouble breathing or functioning. I must not have that bad anxiety because others have panic attacks. Instead I decided to realize that I'm having literal panic attacks and downplaying it to my psychologist and psychiatrist. I've decided to let myself feel those feelings and compare them to my center.

So far it's been fucking brutal. I spent decades pretending I could bottle my feelings and I could fix my mental issues alone. Self medicating with alcohol doesn't work because my demons can swim. My psychologist said that I'm what they call ""flat"" and that my outward emotional expression is really hard to read and mostly neutral. The only time he said there is a change is when we talk about something I'm interested in and I seem slightly excited. It also turns out that most people don't get asked if they are autistic in their lives. Ive been asked several times. High processing speed and emotionless has gotten me called a robot by people close to me.

So far I've been diagnosed with adhd, bi-polar, not bi-polar, GAD, PTSD, not PTSD, persistive depressive disorder severe with anxious distress, and the Doc at the mental hospital also had an opinion but I can't remember. I spent a week at the mental and felt like the doctors didn't take me seriously because of my ""flat"" personality and my comparison to others rather than to myself.

I answered honestly to my psychiatrist on the intake and she takes me seriously in a way the others don't. She said I presented with bipolar. My SO also said I might be bipolar. I talked to my psychologist and explained how I didn't feel I was as honest as I could have been. I explained some of my behaviors that have been happening since I was a kid. He is on my team now. I picked him as a psychologist because he is dry like I am and he doesn't let me walk around the hard stuff. The other people I had went to were really easy for me to change the subject and not deal with it.g

I dont feel like I wasted time because I learned a bunch about myself along the way I may have otherwise missed.  Every moment can be a learning moment and life's journey and the path of getting healthier mentally can be a long winding road that is about the journey rather than the end.

As most people do I thought bipolar was just the ups and downs. Depressed or Manic. My SO told me I didn't know enough about bipolar and I should do some reading. Turns out it's a complicated beast.

I've been paying more attention to my feelings and where I'm at during the day and night. At first I started feeling like my mood was rapid cycling, like within minutes of each other. As I paid more attention to my mood I started thinking about things that have given me that feeling before. So I'm feeling that feeling and then adding another memory doubling up my feelings. Feeling sad, lonely and not being good enough? Well let's add the memories of when my close friend overdosed or when my friend shot herself in the face. Feeling happy and relaxed? Let's remember those times like the birth of my kids or spending quality time with my close family. The happy feelings don't last that long as they are chased down by feelings of nostalgia. My brain tells me that times won't ever be that good again and the best has passed. The books the happiness trap and feeling good have been a good help on getting over my cognitive distortions.

Currently I'm medicated for bipolar disorder and it helps but I'm bad at eating well and sleeping right.

My feelings today have been strange to me as I get further into this journey. I feel manic and depressed at the same time often. There are times where I just feel manic or depressed but they seem to be combined most often. For example today I woke up exhausted and took my meds. I've been doing spring cleaning. I have my house from my divorce and I've been cleaning everything and getting all the junk and her stuff out of my house. I was feeling manic and motivated. While getting stuff done I felt surrounded by the ghosts of the past in my house. Lots of memories coming back. I remembered coming home the day my younger one was born and holding him in my bed and falling asleep with him in my arms. I remembered laying on my bed with the door locked crying my eyes out for what seemed to be no apparent reason and being unable to stop. I didnt want my kids to see me like that. That was the night I used the suicide text number.

My psychologist told me that I'm always doing something whether it's whatever new project I started (way to many unfinished), whatever to do list I made and I seemed to be hiding from myself.

I got a lot done today on my to do list while feeling this strong emotions. I'm trying to get my house to the point that I can manage it as a 50% dad and not have it look like a whirlwind hit it. 

After I got to a point where I felt I got enough done for the day I sat outside (left my phone inside) and just threw the Frisbee for my dog. I was told to just be and that mindfulness would be very beneficial to me enjoying life more. It felt nice to feel the sun on my skin, on my face, the warmth of it through my clothes, the light breeze gently blowing my hair, how happy my dog was just being. It was really nice. I came back inside and sat on my couch and just let all those thoughts I had set aside flood through me. I cried. I cried so fucking hard for about 15 minutes. I felt so down after for about an hour while being restless on my couch and feeling some extreme anxiety. During this time all I wanted to do was finish my to do list.

Maybe these mixed episodes are just a phase but it's really hard to process and go through. I feel a duality inside me and it's impossible for it to continue forever without me losing my shit.

I know this is rambling but it feels like where I'm at right now. The anxiety meds made me tired for about 15 minutes and now im wide awake. I used to write a lot and somewhere a long the line my ability to read and write has gone away but I feel the writing is coming back. Thanks for reading."
How are you kind to yourself when this disorder becomes too much?,2,mlpfc3,2,"I’ve had a shitload of Uni assignments and it will not get *any* lighter until mid-may. I’ve had such bad brain fog for days that I’m definitely going to miss a really really important deadline and my grade is going to take a hard hit. I’ve already missed deadlines, actually. I’m a little better today but I’m still definitely going to miss this deadline and get a reduced grade for a late assignment (god bless, they’ll accept it late instead of automatically failing me). It’s about 20% of my grade, too. Even the accommodations I have through the school are barely helping me. I know I’m not stupid, but man I *feel* stupid. 

How am I supposed to “be kind” to myself? This is quantifiable failure. I’m literally unable to do my work, I can’t do tasks on time. If this were a job I would be fired. There isn’t going to be a nice rest period and I can pick myself back up. This has serious long-term consequences and that’s just... how it is. But all the advice I see for when things get hard is just “be kind to yourself, be patient with yourself, let yourself rest.” I really can’t comprehend how I’m supposed to do that."
Therapist doesn't want to get me evaluated for bipolar disorder,5,mlox36,8,"Hi. I'm a teenaged girl (16f) currently suspecting I have bipolar disorder. The reason for suspecting this is twofold:My mother and sister have bipolar disorder, although only my mom is formally diagnosed. I would often watch her go from staying up late, working on housework and her job with little regard for her health one day, to crying over a bottle of beer contemplating suicide. The second reason is that my old therapist heavily suspected I had some sort of mood disorder due to my frequent, day to month long mood swings. So, I did what any reasonable person would do, and what any person here would tell me to do, and ask about possibly getting evaluated. I told him about the facts, alongside my comorbid diagnosis of executive dysfunction, but he refused to recommend evaluation, on the basis that he thought there was a high chance of misdiagnosis, and told me to come back if a bipolar symptom was actively hindering my function in life or causing problems. I don't know what to do now, because I really do think I need to get checked out for this issue, but should I pressure my therapist more on the issue? Look for a new therapist? Or try and just move on with my life?"

Does anyone else have delusions and/or paranoia that's grounded in things others can believe in?,5,mlof4r,2,"I've never been one for conspiracy theories and other types of Qanon related horseshit. 

That being said!

I've come to realize that my delusions of grandeur and general paranoia, tend to be off-shoots of things that the average person could believe in. I guess there's probably a fine line to the whole thing though. But as mentioned, government agents after me/aliens/etc. have never been something I've personally believed in during episodes. I don't want to get into specifics, but thinking that you can take up say a musical instrument and assuming you put in the effort and time, you could be the best who ever lived that played that given instrument. Every skill out there is something you could master if you cared to put the time and effort in. 

On the paranoia side, for example when in an episode, you think every ache and pain no matter how minuscule is going to kill you because it's really some terminal illness finally manifesting itself. No amount of doctor visits serve to put your mind at ease for anything beyond a short amount of time. 

I feel like in some aspects this is all worse because other people don't really ever pick up on any of it, so you've got not real barometer for how bad any of it is. Unless of course you start acting out on the things which is another thing altogether. Is it worse when you're aware of it but fight with yourself to not act on stuff, or being unaware entirely? Though I'd say the latter just because of the capacity for damage that can be caused with it. I just feel like because I work so hard to keep outward actions/thoughts I'm uncertain about (which tends to be many of them) from being expressed, it gets tiresome as well."

Restlessness agitation,2,mllvyo,4,"Hey guys, new to this forum... I have bipolar 2 and have spent over a year in hospital and have tried everything from ECT to a cocktail of 10 meds. Right now I’m on Lamotrigine, Valproic Acid, Rexulti, Xanax as needed and then at night temazepam and seroquel. I still have really bad depression and this severe agitation sense of restlessness. The only antipsychotic med I haven’t tried is Clozapine as well as MAOI’s I would appreciate any advice."

Looking for someone to talk to,10,mljo1m,6,"Hi, I’m looking for someone to message about my bipolar symptoms (and their damage) who really understands. I do have a therapist, psychiatrist, and I’ve called the help line at my university, but none of these things really have helped because they don’t understand the scope of bipolar. I also am medicated newly so it would be nice to talk to someone else who’s medicated but I think anyone with bipolar would really be great. 

I hope this is okay to post if not I’ll delete it!

Edit: A few people have already reached out and I'm very thankful for this! I think I'm okay on messages for now though!"
I talked to the psych today (very unimportant),6,mlj9sb,2,"I talked to the psych yesterday but had a real shit day at work and a breakdown last night.

I feel a bit better today. We talked about cutting back on the weed and caffeine, and exercising and eating more, and I haven't smoked today. I'm still depressed as all fuck. Life still sucks and I don't really see a reason to continue to live other than my cat and my S/O. I'd be fired if my boss could fire me right now and I cant do anything right. But at least my psych was pretty cool and not condescending so I am looking forward to meeting again and hopefully I'll have a good week and progress to report. Don't think I'm gonna feel any better though but there's always hope."
I finally met up with my friends after hiding for 6 months!,16,mlhmdk,4,"I've been in a group of friends for years which just let to drugs and more drugs. I started off with regular beer and weed. But than everyone became a full on greedy addict starting fights about who's going to snort the biggest line. Living in the rock-bottom. Not sleeping for 5 days straight on meth. Using me for drugs and money and making me feel like I did something wrong. I had to cut all my friends out. And finally met up with someone sober and had a great talk for hours. I really needed that and that meant so much for me. I'm happy about it today, and I just wanted to share to let others know that some things take time and it's worth to socialize with the right people :)"
Considering a leave of absence from work,7,mlhgpi,9,"I work in software sales for a tech startup. I was on fire and really happy! Until it came crashing down 6 weeks ago and I started to have a depressive episode. I thought i was stable because the mania was gone, but really i was depressed.   


I'm scared but i think i need this. Last week I learned my lithium levels have been too low for quite a while. Now I need time to rebuild it back up. My job involves so much interfacing with people and so many uncomfortable moments, it's getting to me.   


Anyone had a leave of absence and not have it backfire?"
When the episode is over.,117,mlh5a6,11,
Does anyone ever feel like we aren’t sick we just are in a toxic environment?,9,mlg1vj,19,"So I’m bipolar 1 “supposedly” for the last 15 years and agree that I’m out of my fucking mind but in a good way. I get “out there”, like really “out there”, like mind bending LSD visions and spirt quest “out there”. I get caught up in the mental health system a lot but have never hurt myself or anyone else, I guess I have came to the realization that no matter how crazy the experience gets I will not defend myself. I know right from wrong no matter what state I’m in and won’t even try to protect my own life if it comes down to it, hardcore pacifist I would call it.

To me these experiences are profound and extremely spiritual.  I don’t do the typical things someone does when having a manic episode, I don’t blow my bank account or have risky sex, I just start bending reality. I usually go days or weeks in this state and often get fired from my jobs for not showing up. I finally lose my ability’s and get busted and thrown in the mental hospital and pumped full of drugs and then get released and go off of them seeking another manic spirit quest.

This has made my life very difficult and painful when the fun ends, I guess mania is the funnest drug I’ve ever found, I’ve done many types of drugs such as mushrooms and mescaline and mdma, and while I did feel the drugs I never experienced any of the visions I do during a manic episode. 

I know eventually if I keep going I’m probably going to die but the things I’ve experienced are out of this world in a cosmic sense and becoming medicated and losing touch with this other side of reality would destroy me. I read a lot of stories about manic episodes and I don’t see any like mine, I’m just wondering if anyone else travels the realm of the metaphysical?"
How do you come out to your partner about your Bipolar diagnosis?,5,mlg1ad,9,"I am a 31 year old male diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder.

The specifics of my diagnosis are unclear, whether it is a familial genetics heritability, although I am certain it is from my childhood trauma from years of neglect, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse from my parents and others. 

Well, lately I’ve been noticing moderate to intense mood swings and irritability, and other general mania symptoms. I’ve come seeking advice on how to come out to your partner about your diagnosis. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 4 months, and honestly haven’t been able to tell her about my diagnosis. For a number of reasons. I’ve harbored a shame about my diagnosis because of all the destruction its wreaked in my life. I’ve felt I can protect my relationship if I held it back from her or protected her from the truth, but lately its been causing disagreements and arguments.

I just don’t have the words. How can I tell her? I’ve thought of showing her my diagnosis letter from my psychiatrist and so far it seems like my best bet."
What is a nap's effect on people with mood disorder?,4,mlfcen,13,A nap helping change your negative mood into a positive one is possible with someone having mood disorder?!.
Rehabilitating myself from home?,2,mley1t,2,"I am bipolar type I with mixed features. I’ve been swinging between high and low for several months now, I had some stretches of stability but mostly manic and hypomanic episodes, with bad lows when I crash. I’m still not recovered from my latest episode and I think I may now be in a mixed episode. I feel emotionally unstable. 

First let me just say: I am not at risk of hurting myself or others. I have however considered hospitalization because I feel so overwhelmed by my life. I’ve done some thinking and have concluded that a hospital stay isn’t financially possible right now unless it’s an emergency situation. I can’t afford inpatient treatment either. 

I’ve decided I want to rehabilitate myself from home. I want to rest, recenter and figure out a plan for getting my shit together. I’m not using any illegal drugs or alcohol right now so there isn’t any physical danger in remaining at home versus the hospital. 

I’d love it if anyone here had any tips or advice on things I can do at home to recover. If anyone here has been to rehab, I’d love to hear about what aspects of it helped you so I can try to incorporate those concepts.  I am not asking for any medical/professional opinions but rather just an open conversation on what worked for you during your experiences in treatment."
Lamictal Rash,2,mlen24,12,"Hello!

My pysch started me on a low dose of Lamictal (25mg) but after around twoish weeks, I started getting random rashes, so she put me down to 12.5 for a week. After that, I went back up to 25mg and got a hive on my neck and general itchiness around that area and my inner arms. She suggested to go back down to 12.5mg until our next appointment (which was today). I took it one more day but then when the rash didn't go down, I stopped for three days total (Saturday through Monday). 

I'm concerned about Lamictal rash. I do have sensitive skin and the weather is changing, but I feel like it's connected to the Lamictal. My pysch is not worried about the rash at all and says if it was SJS it would have happened in the first two weeks that I was on the medication. 

Online publications say it can happen at any time, so I'm not sure if what she is saying is true. These meds are def helping (I'm not diagnosed as Bipolar, it's for another issue), but I am scared of the random itchiness I am getting taking these pills. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Benign, random rashes on Lamictal that aren't a big deal? My pysch isn't worried at all, but there are so many resources that say if you get a rash or hives to stop use immediately. 

Thank you!"
Self Doubt,5,mldy2w,5,"I’m in my mid-40’s and was diagnosed as bipolar two years ago. I’m a wife, a mom and worked in online marketing for 15 years (became a full time mom just before my diagnosis)

I currently live in fear that people don’t like me. That they think I’m weird or off. I’ve never had such terrible self esteem. I see a therapist and am on mediation but it doesn’t stop the incessant thoughts worrying about people and every interaction I have.  

I am living in a new state and away from my life long friends and close family. Not sure if this exacerbates it? I also live in a small neighborhood where everyone knows each other and I feel like it makes me more neurotic.

Any suggestions or coping skills? Is this common for bipolar?  I realize I’m not going to be everyone’s cup of tea, but I need to stop torturing myself. ✌🏼& ❤️"

"Life is unexpected, he’s some of my story...",11,mlbpud,3,"I am a 33 year old male here. I’ve suffered with bipolar disorder my whole life. When I was younger they called it manic depressive disorder. I apologize in advance if this doesn’t make any sense, I am trying my best to describe my feelings and see if anyone out there understands my feelings and struggles. When I was in elementary school I had a lot of energy. My teacher told my mom to get me checked for ADHD. My doctor told my mother it’s manic depressive disorder and that I have been in a long time manic state and therefore my over excitement is from that and not an ADHD issue. I used to get bullied when I was younger for my teeth being too big, my chin being too small(I have an underdeveloped chin and it looks like I have an overbite. Then I went to junior high school and that’s where I started feeling depressed. I had my first suicidal thought and became suicidal at 10-11 because of the stigma I was facing in jr high. A lot more bullying but now even meaner. I was a straight A’s student and I was always big hearted and liked to help people. With that I was taken advantage of and bullied. When I finished jr high at 13 I then started going thru puberty and gained a lot of height and natural cut as far as body shape because I was skinny. I gained a little confidence in myself. So now I’m a teenager and I’m thinking differently about life. Now I’m trying to get a girlfriend be popular typical teen wants based on how I grew up. I soon realized that my mental illness is catching up to me a lot worse than when I was a kid and I found myself hard to have relationships with people. Girls didn’t want to deal with my crazy constant mood swings which made it hard to have a girlfriend. So I go thru high school feeling alone and unwanted. In this time I get this massive rush of sexual feelings where I’m extremely horny and every girl I was even a little interested in I wanted to have a sexual relationship with. This ended up being good and bad. I eventually then started having sexual relationships with older women when I was a teen. I gained this false confidence and pride. A bunch of people in my inner circle which is really small were people from the wrong side of the tracks and introduced me to drugs alcohol and other things of that nature. I gained an admiration for being a criminal or gangster. I’m from NYC and come from a old criminal enclave. I got this instant rush of breaking rules and going against the grain. I then was exposed to all these things like fighting and violence, habitual drug and alcohol use, and wild and risky sex. For some reason I felt better in this environment than my normal life. I should’ve added this before but I come from a tight knit family with typical European family values, we were sheltered from the outside world. Once exposed I literally went against everything I was taught but not on purpose, it was more a natural thing. Now I’m 18 years old I dropped out of college because I couldn’t handle it mentally. I always had this feeling like I was ugly and unattractive. I ended up getting pretty much my whole upper body tattooed with different tattoos that mean different things to me. I always felt it was the best way to express yourself and I feel if people see my tattoos they would be able to understand what I am about a little easier. I also feel like I deserve pain so I take it with the tattoos. At that point I’m completely out of control with my life. I did get a blue collar job and I am really good at my trade which kept me busy most of the time and it helped get my mind off things. When I was 19 I met my wife. I fell in love instantly with her and she did not pick up on my bipolar she just saw a nice guy with a big heart. After marrying her she began to see my bipolar and my mental illness. We got married and now have two kids a girl and a boy. After I had a death in the family I became extremely suicidal with thoughts and even acts. I began an intense therapy and psychiatry regimen. They put me on as a high risk and under suicide watch. I was on Wellbutrin, olanzapine, quetiapine, depakote, lithium, colonzipam as my cocktail. I was taking these prescriptions and it was making me feel like a potato. I expressed myself to my dr and therapist. I eventually stopped taking them and quit going to the dr and therapist. I always argued with the dr but the therapist was great a non bias person to talk to. I moved out of NYC to another state and felt much better. But then it hit me hard again and now without treatment. I have no fear of anything or anyone. I get violent and black out and just attack. I get offended so easily. I feel like everyone is fake and a user. I don’t cheat on my wife but I have this wild sex drive that I cannot control. I love flirting with women and getting attention from them( must be because I’m so insecure and when manic I get overly excited and filled with that manic confidence). I feel like my kids were brought into a fucked up heartless world and I feel like I cursed them by putting them on this earth with so much hurt. I feel like it’s because of my own experience that I feel that. I have so many things in my head that make me miserable. I wake up angry because I am so sad and depressed. I don’t go to a dr because I don’t want to be medicated again. I know people in my situation are supposed to be treated for the rest of their lives but I had such a bad last experience that I don’t want to deal with it again. When I’m manic I’m literally an attention whore. I’m genuinely a great hearted person but my mental illness does not allow me to live a normal life with my family that I love. I don’t want to lose my wife because I have this constant need for a woman’s attention and Im always flirting because I can’t control myself. She also doesn’t like to go anywhere with me because the slightest thing ticks me off and I’ll start arguing and fighting. If I do get physical I get pretty bad because I can’t control my anger. I have never been physical in my life with any women or my kids, it’s only men that I have had any physical altercation with. I’ve been in a couple of life and death situations because of this. Currently I am depressed and sad. I’m so down that I’m fed up with life and I don’t want to continue, but I have so much to live for. It’s so hard when your mental illness controls you and your daily life. I can never be normal and I never felt being normal ever. My emotions swing around all day long which makes me mentally tired and unable to function in day to day life. I read the older you get the worse the bipolar gets. All my characteristics that I thought made me are actually the bipolar disorder symptoms which makes me feel like my whole life is a lie and I actually want to be a different person that what I am seen as. Not to many people know about my illness and I don’t like talking about it because when I do it makes things worse. Thank you for anyone who reads this and I today gained the confidence to make this post. I do feel much better writing this post up.

EDIT- I forgot to add that I am currently in a six figure job and have been for a long time. I have not been able to save any money. No matter how much I try I spend spend spend. If I see something that catches me I have to get it. This also puts a lot of strain in my life as well."

"Told a friend that I had feelings for him, now I need to burn down my house and move to France",29,ml2c86,8,"I've been manic for at least 2 weeks.   I'm not getting any sleep, I'm sleeping like 2 hours a night.  I feel like I'm going to die yet also I feel fucking amazing.

I just had an adult conversation in which I said things.

This is how I feel right now:

Me:   Jesus take the wheel!

Camera:   Pans out to show that I'm saying this after I already ran the car into a brick wall and it's not even drivable  


edited:   It's ""the morning after"".    I only slept 3 hours last night and my eyes flew open at 3am and  I was like, ""Hello darkness my old friend...""  


 I'm still manic but I'm ok.  I went jogging at 6am this morning with a friend who helped me process what I did yesterday.  


I have no emotional hangover.   Not one regret.  What I said, actually needed to be said.     I have a lot of feelings in general and they are all very close to the surface and I am ok with this, I accept this about myself and thank God so do my friends.     


I am not picking out white dresses and running off to Vegas.   I saw him this morning after jogging, we had coffee, I just got home.   It was so unbelievably relaxed and natural.   There was no quid pro quo, no expectations, no ""what do you think about what I said last night"".   Just two friends having coffee and there was nothing special about it, except that one friend likes the other friend, and this fact is known and accepted and it's ok.   It's a fact like he has dark hair or that I had cream in my coffee.   Just a known fact, nothing that anyone needs to ""do something with or about"".  


Whether or not this ""thing"" has legs, I have no idea.   I don't need to know today, I don't need to figure everything out today.   It will be ok either way.

Employment for bipolar person,10,mkygv9,5,My uncle has bipolar disorder. Meds make him fairly slow-moving and affect social skills. He has an English degree and very close to masters. Self-taught and fluent in Spanish and Italian. He’s had a security job for the past few years. He recently moved and hasn’t found any work. Old security company won’t get back to him regarding hiring. Are there any programs that could help someone like him find employment?
Mental Health Spiral,2,mkyg9c,4,"Manic Molly train of thought:
When you live with mental illnesses for a long period of time, several good days in a row are more anxiety provoking than the bad days, because you get used to that trapped state of mind being the status quo. For the first time in almost three years, I am awake again in my better self. The anxiety now comes from the fleeting feeling of a this temporary state, but.... is also filled with a cautious optimism that I can maintain this balance of semi-functioning level of mental wellness.  :(:

Got kicked out of hospital tonight.,22,mkk96p,11,"Went in around 2. My therapist told me to go because my depression has been so bad. First they made me take off all my clothes even undies and put on paper scrubs that were very, very small. Like I couldn’t even pull the top to my waistline. Nor the bottoms for that matter. Just had my big ole fat person skin spilling out all over. And they put me in the hallway b Ed in the ER while they waited for a place to put me. When they finally got me out of the ER it was the PEC unit. I guess it’s the phase between ER and being admitted to the unit. It socks. You get lok a jail bed. It’s bolted to the floor. Vinyl. You get two blankets. One to use as a pillow. At least there was a tv. No remote. You had to stand next to the tv and hit buttons there to go up or down. 

Then it came time for night time meds. The gave me my night mare meds.  My zolpidem. Then dropped the bomb that I can’t take my specially compounded fibromyalgia meds. Without those meds I’ll be in chronic pain. Like opioid pain. But they couldn’t figure out how to get the pharmacist to approve my compounded medication. And the nursed even after I tried to explain about 4 different ways, just never seemed to quite understand what “compounding” is. And the pharmacist just.... idk. 

I threw a fit. Said I didn’t want to be there if it was gonna cause a flare.
So they discharged me. At 10! Pm on a Sunday when my potential rides are an hour away because that’s where I live. Finally got one friend to get me. He’s none too happy. He was ready for bed. I am grateful to him.  But fuck those psych nurses and fuck that pharmacist."

Seroquil caused extreme suicidal thoughts, Zoloft almost killed me. Just am so confused. I’m trying lamictal at 25 mg but I stopped taking it for a few days cause I kept crying and just couldn’t stop unless I did something harmful to myself. I stopped smoking weed cause maybe that’ll fix what’s happening but idk, just feeling really lost.

Anyone else have bipolar disorder and ADHD along with fibro?,2,mkelne,6,"3 years ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, last year I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and a couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with probable ADHD.

My current plan is to wean off cymbalta because I’ve never felt it did anything for me and essentially replace it with the Wellbutrin. I was warned the Wellbutrin can exasperate anxiety.

"Anyone here ever hit with a dose of human interaction thats considered normal for most folks, and realize how badly you need it and how completely detached you are from that world?",18,mkd5wi,4,"tldr: drove across my state to pick up a girl I barely knew to hang out/stay over for a few days, it didn't go well.

*ahem* it's a bit of a book, but I'm trying to give a full picture, bear with me. 

My dumb-assin-ass did a stupid thing and drove across my state to pick up a girl I barely knew because we'd recently connected via social media over a post I made about the crushing conditions of modern society, and how little I wanted to be a part of it. She was stuck in our hometown, and by my estimation caught between her own bad habits and her toxic surroundings. (Drugs, bad friends, etc)

We'd started talking and quickly progressed to oversharing some pretty dark stuff about ourselves, to the point where we basically blew past the regular ""getting to know each other"" stuff. We'd gotten to the point where we'd started feeling some kind of intimate kinship in our shared experiences, regardless of the fact that we'd not even hung out in person. (we had talked on the phone a few times) 

The plan had been to hang out at my house (which my mother owns, and which I have to myself), and just kick it for a few days, do some gardening/other wholesome activities. I've been living in this house for years and have done a lot to structure my environment and activities to help me maintain a healthy lifestyle, as well as allowing me to keep up with my responsibilities. 

I'd been telling her about how much I benefited from simple activities like gardening, fish keeping, and yoga, and how I had all the gear to go on a little wilderness/beach adventure if she was up for it. She'd mentioned some toxic ex who'd been threatening her, or rather had threatened her in the past, not gonna lie, the details were sketchy and I didn't ask too many questions. Shit happens, you seem cool, and I think we both could use the company. 

I'd floated the idea of her maybe moving in (down the line) if she liked the place, and was willing to hold up her end (hold down a job, pay bills, etc - something I'm very much still trying to do myself). She'd been bouncing from crap job to crap job, and was getting extremely discouraged with her prospects, I have some connections in my city that could help her land a reasonable gig that'll at least serve as a jumping-off point.

I've been unemployed waiting to get my covid vaccine, and basically have spent the last few months in pretty intense isolation, which definitely contributed to my impulsivity. I had been working as a substance abuse counselor in a correctional setting before the pandemic started, and I had done well at it too, but decided to quit to visit a family member overseas, didn't end up going (thanks covid).

Long story short I spent most of the pandemic staying home, gardening, and really honing my musical skills (probably the *only* silver lining to my pandemic experience). I've always been a bit of a loner/isolated, even though many people seem to consider me to be a highly social person (I can be to a point), but the pandemic, and the total absence of normal socialization led to some pretty sketchy hookups that were fun, but ultimately regrettable. I've been extremely deprived of both normal person to person interaction, as well as physical contact, is my point.

She agreed to stay over a few days, so I packed up and drove three hours to get her. Upon arriving at her house I met her mother, who (100% justifiably) was quite skeptical about this strange man who'd come (seemingly) out of the blue to whisk her daughter away. I explained that I'd been talking to her about some of my hobbies and how helpful they'd been for me, which seemed to put her at enough ease for us to pack up and hit the road without incident.

The drive to my city was long, we listened to music, talked, and generally had a good time being in each other's presence for the first time in like 10 years, initially a bit strange, but we were at ease with each other soon enough. We'd had to stop and pick up a prescription for her on the way, got a few groceries, and we'd run into her ex boyfriends father (who was in possession of her dog, and taking terrible care of it), he didn't recognize her, and we didn't say anything to him. Having concluded our detour, we hit the road. 

Upon arriving back in my city, I gave her a tour of the place, and we decided to just kick it and watch some shows (I recall bob's burgers and it's always sunny). We'd gotten cuddled up and things seemed to be going alright, she was tired/a little under the weather (fingers crossed it isn't covid), so we decided to both turn in early, which I for the life of me couldn't. 

I couldn't stop shifting around trying to find a good position to sleep, so I finally asked her if she'd be okay with me being the little spoon (cuddling closer than we had before), she said sure. Words can't describe the deep peace and the comfort I felt being held like that, I can't remember the last time I felt that good, easily better than sex, for there was a sense of peace and wholeness here that I have lacked for as long as I care to think back. (I've had some good relationships in the past, but nothing for some time)

I stopped shifting around but ultimately decided to just let her sleep and move into another room since apparently sleep wasn't happening for me anytime soon. I'd been in talks with the director of the rehab facility I'd been working at, regarding their desire to hire me back at an insultingly low salary, and I'd been preparing to counteroffer, as well as bringing some sample materials I'd like to use in class and group activities. Our repertoire at the facility had been atrocious (corrections, go figure). Stuff like little video essays on mental health (philosophy, conformity, etc,), some relevant clips from movies and TV shows, as well as some relevant music, good material.

Whenever I tired of combing the depths of YouTube for content, and deciding which materials to present in which order, with which activity/discussion topic to follow the material, I shifted into a different activity. I love art and have decorated my bedroom richly with posters, prints, as well as art-postcards basically collaged onto the wall. I'd found the process of decorating my space to be quite rewarding, so I started to lay down the postcards on the tile-floor of my large, barely furnished living-room, in order to get an overview of what I had on hand.

As I laid the cards out, I started to realize that I was actually having fun and taking my time laying the postcards out, rearranging them, and even creating forced-perspective continuous images from some of my black and white postcards of a barbed wire adorned Berlin wall. Just playing, I am a sucker for minimally structured, creative activities (in a therapeutic setting), took some pictures, and took note of this as a potential group activity. 

Once I finished laying the postcards out across most of the living room floor, still not tired, I shifted gears and started to look over some of the stuff I'd written over the years (specifically the *good* pile). I'd developed a writing technique for myself that involved distilling content to its purest form (usually just a clean hook or a punchline), and flipping to a fresh page if I couldn't think of any way to develop the idea further. It led to tons of post-it's and pieces of notebook paper with hastily scrawled hooks and punchlines, as well as longer stretches of lyrics, and once again I'd learned how fun it was to rearrange these different little tid-bits into something more substantial.

So passed the night, never going to sleep for fear of disturbing my guest. Upon awakening in the morning she didn't seem to be feeling so great and started to talk about her (stolen, neglected) dog, and how she really needed to get her (the dog) out of her current situation. Seeing her beat around the bush I point blank asked if she needed to go back home now to deal with this, she said yes, 5 minutes later we're on the road headed back to resolve this situation (mind you it's a 6 hour drive, there and back, I'd done the drive the day before, *hadn't slept*, and just got back in the truck and started driving).

She seemed a little on edge on the drive down (reasonable, dog welfare is a bit of a sore spot for me too). I unironically offered to steal her dog back for her, but she declined saying she'd rather go the official route (the smart thing to do, I was mostly just trying to be supportive). We didn't talk a whole lot (that I can remember, it's honestly a bit of a blur, I was focused on the road), but the vibe wasn't tense, as much as concerned. We got back to her place, I hugged her goodbye, told her to keep me updated on the situation.

Cue silence, minimal responses, just an awkward shift from what had been animated conversation. I finally called it out and asked her if I'd unintentionally offended her or crossed a boundary without realizing it, because she'd clearly started keeping me at arms length. I made it clear that I wasn't gonna be a dick if she no longer wanted anything to do with me, and that I simply wanted to know if I'd made a mistake, in order to prevent making that same mistake in the future. She informed me that she'd gotten out of a relationship too recently, and that the *mutual* cuddling had been too familiar for her and that it'd made her uncomfortable.

*fuck*

I'd made every effort to *not* be too familiar with her, due to the fact that she was away from home in a strange city, and I wasn't tryna be weird about it. She'd put herself in a vulnerable position (admittedly an objectively foolish decision on her part), but I wasn't about to do or say anything that would suggest that I intended to escalate from what had been light, cozy cuddling (think my feet crossed and propped on her legs type stuff, it had been *fine*, good even). No shady alterior motive, just the anticipation of spending a few days with a cute girl hopefully introducing her to some wholesome activities to take her mind off all the chaos at home. 

I didn't probe too much after she told me that she wasn't ready to be familiar/intimate like that, and have come to the conclusion that I must have been too familiar, asking her to spoon me (once again, no bump&grind, just sleep). I was and am mortified at having misread the situation, and having let my selfish desire to just be held by another human being blind me to the fact that I crossed a line without meaning to.

I told her, ""There's how we think we made someone feel, and then there's how we *actually* made them feel. I'm sorry I misread the situation and didn't check in more explicitly, to make sure you were okay with cuddling up a bit closer."" Ironically I'd been thinking about how to approach/discuss boundaries that night, because things can get so intense and disorganized in my mind sometimes that it's easy to get confused and send mixed/the wrong signals. 

Wellll, that should have probably been the first conversation we had, because this was an avoidable fuckup. I should have first of all recognized that I was hypo enough to not be able to come to rest, while simultaneously being so exhausted and run down that my behavior was a bit muted (especially after being up all night and having to drive another 3 hours on no sleep), she used the word ""icy"" to describe my demeanor, which I say is mischaracterizing, I was just being quiet and conserving energy. She wasnt upset with me, and said she understood where I was coming from, but clearly the vibe had been harshed, and the good times were over. 

Conclusion, I was too hyperactive to have any person who doesn't *really* know me over, and I should have listened to the part of my brain telling me I'm an idiot and called it off. But here I am, like an idiot. Happy Easter everybody.

Stopping medication under doctor’s supervision and unmedicated bipolar.,3,mk8ost,18,"I’ve been taking Lamotrigene and Abilify for close to two years now.

I remember I stopped my lamotrigene suddenly when I first started taking it and it triggered a bit of my mania. But I feel much more prepared emotionally for an episode if it were to occur than I was back then. 

I’ve been relatively stable, I’m about to graduate school. I’m starting therapy again next week. Life’s going okay. I’ve just come to the conclusion I no longer want to take medication for my bipolar.

When he is stable, sometimes he talks to me about His problems, family issues, regrets, work, his college experience etc. He acknowledges that is psychologically suffering, but as I  mentioned earlier I believe the root cause is the bipolar disorder... and he doesn’t know he has it.

Should I really f**k off? For good? I would love to say how can I help him by telling him it may be just a pill that could help you but I don’t think I could nor I dare to tell him anything about it. I just would like to get a bipolar patient perspective on this matter."

trying to stop myself from making a man suffer for perceiving me,2,mk4yro,4,"TL;DR: i'm just now getting a handle on my diagnosis and then this guy managed to find a hole in the very tall wall i've built around myself and i'm scared and not confident in my ability to not ruin this on purpose.  


up until about 1.5 years ago, i had been in very toxic relationships with all people. i would purposefully make the men and women i was intimate with ""prove"" their love. it would get into... some sick and ugly tests. it also led me to get involved with some pretty violent individuals.

2 years ago i gave up hard drugs, and this year i was finally diagnosed and i'm currently trying to find the right combination of meds. i've been purposefully celibate for the last 4 years b/c i wanted to stop the cycle of abuse i was engaged in. 

but now there is someone and i'm letting him into my very small circle. we originally met several years ago and just recently reconnected. the fact that he knew me before has made it easy for me to be open about my past and my diagnoses (or shit maybe i'm missing all the social cues and just over-sharing 😬). anyway the information hasn't scared him off (i think).

what he doesn't know is i've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts about fucking this up on purpose. also seeing him put me into a hypomanic state, and that scared the shit out of me. i want to be just cool and calm and let things develop organically but the intrusive thoughts are screaming at me that that isn't possible. that i'm broken and i don't deserve to have anyone interested in me, even tangentially. 

maybe i'll get lucky and he'll be a cold hearted serial dater who was only interested in my body and nothing else. boy, that would solve all this + would really help reenforce the crumbling view of myself i'm still holding onto."
i feel like i’m rotting,25,mk4akk,11,
My new psychiatrist thinks I might not be bipolar,9,mk43q0,3,"He's wrong, definitely. He'll realize as he gets to know me that my pill induced stability does not say anything about my true self and that I appear more functioning than I actually am, but at the moment, he believes I don't suffer from any affective disorder, and that it was all CPTSD related issues.

And for a moment I was relieved. So, so relieved. I thought that maybe he's right, and it was all misunderstanding. For just a second, I thought I might be in the clear, and it gave me so much comfort.

I'm not the type to call bipolarity a curse. I'm actually quite happy with what I have - I'm greatly intelligent, highly empathetic, and very talented (and this is coming from within a depressive episode). I think that neurodiversity is hard, but in many cases worth it. 

Despite this, the thought of being 'normal' seemed quite pleasing. Not because bipolarity is bad, but because it must be much, much easier to not have it. 

I'll never know, though, because it's hereditary, and it's definitely there. But still. Must be nice."
Is anyone on Rexulti + Vraylar?,2,mk3nko,1,"I stopped Rexulti after being on Vraylar for some weeks. Rexulti did a lot for me and my prescriber didn't want me to stop it until I got results with the Vraylar - he wanted to leave well enough alone even then and have me continue taking them both, but I thought it was a bit pointless to be on two antipsychotics and I asked to try to stop Rexulti. I've noticed my mood has been declining since I stopped it, slowly enough that I didn't really attribute it to stopping Rexulti (the couple times I couldn't take Rexulti for a bit all hell broke loose in about two days), but now I'm thinking it's connected. I'm wondering if I should go back to taking them both at once.

I don't want to go off Vraylar, because it helps with negative symptoms that Rexulti didn't touch (lethargy, anhedonia), but now that I'm feeling so depressed I'm having lethargy and anhedonia again, just flavored differently.

I don't know, I'm just curious about whether people are on this meds combo and whether it worked for them. I'm also on Depakote for mania.

I'm hoping the Rexulti helps, because every SSRI or SNRI I've been on has either done nothing or made me intolerably aggressive. Latuda did nothing, Lamictal did nothing...I really want to not feel depressed. I'm not taking care of basic responsibilities."
Curious as to those who loathe mania,15,mk2y6p,26,"I see a lot of posts where people are productive during mania/hypomania and get a lot done. I'm new to this sub and was wondering how many people really loathe being manic. (Diagnosed Bipolar 1)

My mania manifests as extreme uncomfortableness. I pace around constantly with my thoughts running a million mph. It's veryy unpleasant along with the inability to sleep. I've been in quite a bit of legal trouble due to recklessness/irresponsibility. I get little to no feelings of euphoria. I am extremely erratic during this period, sort of like a fuck it attitude, and unpredictable... it sucks!

Hopefully I can get on the right medication regime soon. Lithium seems to be a good option for Bipolar 1. (Currently on Lamictal and Seroquel 600mg).  


Thank you for the silver! I'm glad to see a lot of people here also share this struggle with me. "

Why don’t I believe that other people have depression/bipolar?,4,mk1v8e,18,"I know it’s statistically and objectively true that other people have debilitating mental illness besides me, but there’s an “inherent” thought that says otherwise. I can’t bring my most natural self to believe that other people besides me are depressed. My logical self says “Other people can have depression that’s equal to or worse in severity in yours” .. my “natural/inherent” self says “You’re the only one in the world who experiences *real* depression.

What is something you did during a manic episode that ended up being AWESOME/SO POSITIVE,13,mjo132,22,"Most of the things I've done during a manic episode are things that i've regretted, that I am incredibly embarrassed by, things I'll regret for the rest of my life, thing I can't forgive myself for. BUT, there are things I know I will look back on years from now and laugh at. There are things I look back at now and laugh at.

BUT, what are things you've done during a manic episode that have actually been GREAT for your life? What did you do that ended up having a positive impact?

&#x200B;

* During a manic episode you shaved your head, your doctor notices a mole that ends up being cancerous and they end up conducting surgery before there's a problem and you're SAVED!

&#x200B;

* Did you decide to quit your job, end up finding out your passion ends up being painting?

&#x200B;

* You're so irritable during an episode that you hit your partner, cops are called, cops find out your partner had been abusing your kid. You never see your partner again, your kid is safe. 

&#x200B;

* You decide to share WAY too much with a random person on a customer service call...a 5 hour customer service call. All about your insecurities, your love life, and in those 5 hours, you inspire THEM to make positive changes in THEIR life. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(more extreme versions)

* You go to a cafe and your irritability and anger cause you to punch a guy you thought looked JUST LIKE your cheating EX (you were hallucinating) . Well, cops were called and they FOUND HIS MANIFESTO AND ASSAULT RIFLES apparently you thwarted his plan to assassinate Bill Gates and his entire family who was sitting a few tables away, so he ends up giving you Billions of dollars? You then go home and dye your hair pink. Doja Cat now wants to date you. 

&#x200B;

* So you decide that you are totally capable of stealing the Mona Lisa. You go to France, while conducting your surveillance inside the Louvre you spot someone who ALSO resembles your cheating ex (again you're hallucinating) and you realize he's stealing children and now he's going to sell their organs? (apparently this is a very old school teacher with whiskers taking children to the museum) Well, you start screaming and pointing at the children and the teacher, so they run away, seconds later a bomb goes off. TURNS OUT, someone was ALSO there to steal the Mona Lisa and they had planted a bomb. You have now saved a Nun and a group of school children. The Prime Minister awards you knighthood AND allows you to take the SECRET REPLICA of the Mona Lisa home...that no one knows exists...it was the original draft of the Mona Lisa that was made. MUAHAHA. You also dye your hair, Doja Cat still wants to date you."

"I want to have friends but I am not able to keep them, both in mania and depression",19,mjm7jk,4,"for all of my life, I've had only a handful of friends. I am not really good at keeping them, because I am terrible at calling or sending those messages like 'hey, how are you? it's been a while!' out of the blue. even though I do get back to anyone who send me one of those.

during school and college, I had at least one person that I was always talking to because, well, we saw each other every single day. 

when I finished college, I didn't have anyone besides my partner. they kept asking me to get someone else to talk to because they thought it would be healthier and would of course relieve some of the burden I (uncounsciously) deposited in them.

in the past few years, I was diagnosed with depression, then bipolar disorder (thanks to a terrible mania-driven debt), found out I really identify as non-binary, questioned my sexuality and my sex drive... and I've kept all emotions and thoughts about these things mostly to myself because I feel like my therapist doesn't get it (long short story, she is older and doesn't feel like I am non-binary but a woman and denying everything else. I know I should get someone else, but it's hard due to financial issues), my partner shuts off everytime I talk about anything of the sorts (and with this pandemic, being 24/7 together, I understand why they are shutting off), and the last two friends that I have are in a completely different time of their lives (one is single, with the mind of a little inocent girl (in a good sense), and the other is already a mother of two).

I have tried Slowly, my partner and I have an open relationship but I struggle to find someone because I want to talk and not really 'have sex right now', I have tried talking randomly to people in the internet, but I seem like I either am in complete mania (too many emojis and wanting to talk every second and changing the subject every time and not using a single damn comma), or I am in depression and I can't speak to anyone. 

and then, through the mania or the depression, the friendship becomes a burden to me, and I simply quit it (mostly ghosting people, which I hate) because I can't do it anymore. 

I think bipolar isn't the single cause to this, but it does complicate things very much... and right now I feel like I am getting to a very good place of stability, but at the same time I am afraid of trying to talk to anybody and iniciating a new friendship / rekindle old ones.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I've had no friends for too long and bipolar doesn't help, but I am afraid of trying to talk to anybody now that I am more stable. 

maybe someone has gone through any of this and can share something?

and thanks if you read through this damn long post. really appreciate it!"
Finally accepting I'm bipolar and that the doctors aren't wrong after a 4 week high and sudden depressive/suicidal episode,12,mjm0dj,3,"Just feeling sick of the endless and constant cycle. I feel depressed most the time, start to feel better, make plans for the future and set some BIG goals for myself that I'll think I can accomplish in less than a week, things kind of escalate and then fizz out and I give up before I have even started. I've been dealing with some suicidal thoughts, on medical leave AGAIN, started new meds two weeks ago and part of me just.. just wants to be done. I want to be done and just quit.

Things slipped just ever so slightly and it's been hard to prevent things from getting worse,5,mjkuxr,6,"I recently started seeing my ex girlfriend again and I think my recent bout of depression is somehow connected, but, I'm doing the work.  I've been going to the gym, I'm trying to reach out to what support network I have, I'm taking care of myself and eating right and sticking to my sleep schedule as best I can.  I've been seeing my therapist every week.  I was even down to see the Cherry Blossoms today and I must have walked 4-5 miles trying to soak up as much of the sunshine as I can.  It's hard though.  This wave of depression has hit me like a ton of bricks and I don't know if I have anybody in my life that truly has time for it.  It's also been so incredibly long since it's been this bad and it's hard to stay focused.  

It's hard to remind myself that this too shall pass when I'm being frantic and a little clingy with my ex.  It's hard when I feel like my work relationships are suffering even if it's an inconsequential amount.  My mom said I seemed a little down when I went to see her yesterday and it's all kind of coalescing.  Work stress, stress with the leasing office and the power outage earlier this week, stress with the gf and how heavy her work schedule has been and how she's creating space in a very difficult way... I think part of the problem this week was how my sleep schedule got disrupted on Tuesday after a hard conversation with the ex but.... It shouldn't only take 1 bad sleep day to do this to me.

Does anybody else experience periods of extreme hyper sensitiveness to emotions occasionally?,23,mjgvpz,18,"This is going to sound weird, I honestly don't know if it's my bipolar II disorder or my borderline personality disorder, but sometimes maybe once every 2 weeks or more, I get extremely emotional and cry **very very** easily at things that wouldn't normally make me cry. 

For example I'm watching Godzilla versus King Kong. The most basic of sad parts in the movie are making me literally tear up and want to just bawl. 

Normally when I see things like this I would think ""oh that's sad"" But it wouldn't phase me emotionally, I wouldn't have nearly as an emotional response."
I’ve never felt so isolated and alone in my depression,11,mjg7u5,5,"I recently started seeing my ex again for the first time in a year and there seems to be a very coincidental collapse in my mental state. We dated for almost two years and lived with each other for most of it. Things were messy at the end to say the least and we still have a lot of work to do. 

Monday started with her ranting to me about her mom and then attacking me over something completely unrelated. That took me out of my normal routine, I ended up using Ativan to get to sleep and slept in way later than usual Tuesday morning. That led to me not using my light box and Ativan again that night... and there’s been a series of destabilizing events all week. 

I’ve been doing my absolute best to stay active, eat right and not drink caffeine but it just hasn’t been enough. I’ve been hitting the gym and getting out tor walks a lot. The problem for me right now is way she has been creating space for herself has been causing me issues and there hasn’t really been a good point to talk about it with her. If she needs me to not contact her for a few days so she can gather her life together that’s fine, I just need her to be more explicit.  As it stands she basically created a no contact zone for an indefinite period of time and I have no idea where her head is at. 

Over the years I’ve really struggled to make friends and I don’t currently have anybody in my life that I can hit up to hang out or even really confide in while feeling safe. Nobody understands the depression. I tried to communicate where I was to my now gf and she kinda blew me off. Just finished a two hour walk but it still doesn’t feel like enough. I reached out to a coworker to hang out tonight but I’m unsure if those plans will come through. So it’s not like I’m not trying.

I'll share. 

1.  I have always liked to draw, write lyrics. As a teen, I remember drawing a photo of a girl to represent myself. She had two sides. One side was a ghost, the other was alive and not really so happy. 

2. I also journaled a lot and remembered once drawing a deranged face to represent how I was feeling inside.

Wow. Such emotions. I found out the day I had a huge interview. Anyways. 

They spoke with her to confirm identity, and have sent a letter from me and some pictures to her. I think she will write back too. 

During the call where they confirmed identity, she shared some details about herself and this is how I found out she’s bipolar. She lives alone, has a daughter (who doesn’t know about me). 

Oh my god I have a sister. I’m so happy, I’ve never had one before. 

Anyways - guys can you please help me understand or be aware of anything around bipolar disorder that I can do to be mindful of her condition. It’s obviously very overwhelming and emotional and I want to make sure I’m making it as easy as possible for her.

I can't tell what's me anymore.,15,mj3xc3,6,"Hello, 

I've been on this kick to find places where I can talk about aspects of me and bipolar is definitely one of them.

Like the title says, even before I was diagnosed, I have no idea what's real anymore. Not in terms of reality, I think anyway, but more so what's a genuine and naturally occurring feeling and what's a ""corrupted"" or ""influenced"" feeling / idea. Here's what I mean:

One day I wake up and my first thought is of suicide. Nothing triggered it, there's no stress, the sun's shining, everything is as it should be and yet that's my first thought shortly after I open my eyes (in fact, this was one of the first clues I had that something was seriously wrong with me). This is clearly not a thought that I willed into existence, it is a thought that was put there or encouraged or magnified by a depressive episode.

On the flip side, I'm happy, but like really happy and loose and giggly and I'm the wittiest guy alive and I care and I'm going to cure cancer and run for president and write a book. That's not normal either because my base state is a very calm and quiet self. These ""happy"" thoughts are fake. They weren't put there by me, they were put there by this hypomanic episode. I don't actually want to run for president, I can't actually cure cancer, and I generally could care less, but im also not the worst, I don't deserve to die, and everything is chill. 

That's without lithium.

Lithium has been a fantastic equalizer although I'm concerned about the side effects I keep reading about and what would happen if I ever got off it. It scares the shit out of me. On lithium, I still can't tell where I start and the drug begins. The peaks that were once the rockies are now the Appalachians. The iceberg of depression is now an ice cube. Instead of uncontrollable belly laughter and rainbows coming out of my ass, I smile gently and laugh accordingly.

Is this me? Or is this me on drugs? Is the great capacity for extreme emotion me? Or is that the disease? Was the happiness I felt genuine, or have I never felt ""normal"" happiness at all? Have I been a prisoner along for the ride locked inside and freed by lithium, or has that person never existed? I've always been one extreme or the other, I don't remember a time when I was simply me. Now I feel like I have training wheels on and a gentle hand on my back guiding me through life and while I appreciate not waking up to a hangmans noose, nothing matters anymore, everything is aight, I have no hobbies and don't look forward to anything and don't enjoy anything that much. 

It feels like someone strapped pillows to the sides of my face and everything is muffled. Off of lithium I'm an uncontrollable fusion reactor, or I'm a lifeless abyss. 

When I said I believe my base is calm and quiet and I'm quite uncaring, that's a wild guess. I really don't know. Every time I enjoy something or really enjoy something I wonder if that's just the mania. Every time I obsess and hyper focus I wonder if that's normal or just some other chemical imbalance. Every time I get irritable and it doesn't go away after a day, I think of the poor soul on the receiving end having to deal with someone who has no control over themselves. Who has no understanding of why they do what they do and is at the mercy of their wild unstable emotions as much as they are. 

I'll either tenderly care for you, or I'll brutalize you, or I'll be an endless void that will suck the emotion out of a room. There is no middle. 

Thanks for reading even if you don't respond. I don't actually expect to have you answer the question of where I begin. I try to keep my life as busy as possible so I don't think about such things, but I hate unanswered questions and I can't wrap my head around this."
Feeling very alone,6,mj38r9,2,"I came home from a psychiatric facility today. I was too late picking up my new meds and I know I won’t be able to sleep tonight. I cried and cried and my husband got annoyed and told me he didn’t have the energy for me. I’m feeling very alone. He says he doesn’t have the spoons. I can understand that, but I feel so abandoned. He told me he would take care of me. I’ve had awful fears of him leaving me due to my mental illnesses. I always feared he would get tired of and wouldn’t want to take care of me anymore because of my mental health problems which are happening literally all the time. I’m just fucking up everything."

I just need to write this.,8,miye7u,7,"I have never disclosed most of this to anyone including plethra of therapists. 

I grew up in a not so stable home. Physical needs were met...food, shelter, etc. What no one knew was my father was a raging alcoholic and my mother was a manipulating, mentally ill woman capable of whittling down a person's self esteem within 3 sentences. Hell my brother used to enjoy getting everyone riled up out of spite and would stand back to enjoy the fall out. That left me, the youngest, to smooth tensions out, to be the master of peace keeping. My earliest memory of that was at 4 years old. That's a lot of stress on a 4 year old. The yelling, walking on egg shells, the physical violence left an impression. 

I did well through the early part of grade school. My perfectionism was starting to come through. The older I got the harder it was for me to interact with my peers. One teacher pulled me aside and said I was different...I was much more mature than my siblings.  I should have told her what was happening at home. Being mature and rational was a matter of life and death.

In middle school I was want to say I was bullied but it went so much further than that. The things that were done to me..it was really bad. My parents knew about the bullying. They would go to the school but nothing was ever accomplished. Fun fact I was almost suspended for punching my main aggressor but I managed to talk the discipline committee out of it. So slowly whatever self worth I had was gone. I spent my recess time in the library reshelving books.  

As puberty kicked in at 12ish I had my first 6 year long depressive episode. It felt like static in my brain. I could barely keep myself from crying. Fun fact: I once told my mom that I didn't want to live anymore. I was 14 or 15. Did she ask questions? No. Did she hug me? Nope. I was told to never say that again. I knew at that moment I was on my own. I had to be small and not stick out or be noticeable. 

High school time! I don't know how I got through high school. I focused on my music and my grades but I could never be good enough. I was a walking time bomb of stress and anxiety. I didn't have the greatest emotional control. The people who I thought were my friends only let me into the group out of sympathy. No one liked me. I guess I couldn't blame them. It just confirmed that I was worthless.  Why didn't anyone see how bad I was struggling? 

I started cutting in my senior year. Well cutting isn't exactly what I was doing. I wasn't using objects...I was using my finger nails to scratch away skin. God the release I felt through self harm was euphoric.  I continued this through most of college. 

I did try to seek help in college through campus services.  They didn't help. It was staffed my psychology students working on advanced degrees. Everyone saw the cuts and scars. No one cared to ask. Not. One. Fucking. Person.

This is getting too long and I am nervous to write the stuff that comes in next so...hey I took a good first step.

It wasn't until 20 tears later I was diagnosed with bipolar. I resisted the diagnosis for 10ish years. Most recently ptsd was added. I don't understand where I picked ptsd but it's apparently there."
Treatments for Bipolar neurodegradation i.e. memory loss and executive function deficit?,11,miy81i,4,"Are there any documented treatments in the medical literature or in your experience that counteracts the brain damaging effects of mood in BP?

Why do I keep having these reactions,5,mixpot,5,"28/F I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II and panic disorder, and I have always painfully struggled with social anxiety. I was finally put on meds a few days ago. I accomplished getting help all by myself. And I know it's going to take a few for the meds to kick in and for me to adjust, but it stills feels like I'm not being fairly supported by my partner.

I try to keep my composure, but I can't help it. The moment something unexpected happens, I feel the panic well up in my throat. It strangles my voice from the inside when I never have a problem talking and chatting ""normally"". It's painful in my neck and my chest tightens. It steels my entire body. I'm nauseous, I'm suddenly sweaty and hot even though it was chilly outside today. All my energy gets sucked away. Then I have to pretend to go along with it and not make a fuss, because the mere fact that it bothers me is weird and stressful. ""Just roll with the punches"" I'm told. When I think about the situation logically, it sounds like an opportunity for a fun time. But I was surprised this time. I was caught me off guard, thrown for a loop- ect. I was the only one who didn't know the plan, and now I'm in a tedious situation that I wasn't aware that I was about to be in and it completely fucks my ability to brain. I have a busy weekend ahead of me, I have a lot on my mind, I go to work constantly, and on my 1 day off I can't even have things half way my way. I had a fucking plan, and I'm not even allowed to have that. Whatever. I'm the petty asshole for wanting to have control over myself I guess. I'm the fucking psycho because my needs are different than ""normal"". When I have a reaction to something, I'm left to my own devices. I don't want to keep putting my partner through this, but they're at a loss for energy with this now. They're losing patience with me. They're sick of babysitting my tantrums and panicked states. I'm working SO FUCKING HARD to try to get better and be better, but I need to be told things explicitly. No alarms, no surprises."
Phentermine really messed me up,7,mixnnw,1,"My doctor prescribed me phentermine to help control my eating (i have binge eating disorder). It worked great at first but then I started feeling awful. 

I got horribly depressed and was dissociating and couldn’t sleep. I started self harming daily again and then I tried to overdose on my migraine medication and ended up in the hospital. Luckily I didn’t take too many (I panicked and ran and told my grandma what I did). I told the hospital staff it was an accidental overdose and they released me after 6 hours. I had to stop taking the phentermine immediately and my doctor increased my mood stabilizer and prescribed me trazadone to help me actually sleep. 

Now it’s two weeks later, and I am feeling much better. I am self harm free for 7 days. I am sleeping normally again. That phentermine really was not a good idea. I am so thankful to be feeling stable again. Thanks for listening."
Need help managing meds for bipolar,1,mixbdm,2,"Hello, I’m In need of dire help to manage my bipolar and or ADHD. My psychiatrist has prescribed clonidine / Trileptal to manage my gift, but I’m unsure if this will be a good combo for my issues. During my manic episodes, I have an incredibly inflated ego, increased sex drive, racing thoughts, overspending, overeating, and extreme irritability. On a day-to-day basis, I have extreme difficulty focusing, bad social anxiety, which affects my social life as I seem like an asshole in public and unable to approach women (never understood why), getting work done, and terrible memory (short and long term). Originally was prescribed clonidine (.1mg) and Wellbutrin, but this combo left me extremely anxious, empty and scared to leave my house because of this. I then was prescribed just .1mg clonidine and 150mg Trileptal but never took the combo as I read up on the side effects of Trileptal and was drawn away, so I stopped taking meds, felt great, and then began having a few manic episodes, along with occasional moodiness and still unable to get anything done, just felt like I can’t control my time per usual. I then purchased 30mg Vyvanse pills off a friend to see how ill feel off a stimulant, I was taking two a day, and I’m getting a ton of work done, more creative/productive, genuinely feeling better than ever as I feel as if I feel like myself and feeling that I can finally control my time. The only issue is that my shirt term memory deteriorated, and unable to remember words and such from the past. Today took 130mg of Trileptal and 30mg of Vyvanse and felt good but not motivated as I felt sleepy, and after the sleepyness sore off just felt very moody and on edge. So all in all, with this post, the experiences I’m seeking help on what may be the best drugs for me to help me as I’m ok with being bipolar, I want to be motivated, get work done and finally be able to sit down read a book and understand it without forgetting what I just read."
Daylio Use and tracking sobriety,5,mix5e5,1,"Hey there everyone, I wanted share something cheerful and full of good news. After my last manic episode and finally stabilizing, I’ve decided to confront my demons, and begin journaling out my trauma and baggage to bring to therapy. I thought I was at a happy place, but after this episode it became apparent when I entered psychosis that it wasn’t simply true. It made me come to the realization that I have to give up drinking completely as I am utterly incapable of having a healthy relationship with alcohol any longer. 

As per tracking my moods, what are some tips for setting up Daylio? I have quite a bit of it set up, and usually remember to enter my entry, but I want to be really thorough so I know what is triggering for me, and what behaviors show when an episode is starting or ending, or just triggering behaviors in general.

A year-long mixed episode is a unique experience,930,mis30d,99,
Where did my flow go and how do I get it back? I need my swagger back,6,mirywr,3,"This is the first winter and spring I've been on this combination meds and dose.

Winter was actually one of the best ones I've had in a long time. I started using my light lamp about 3 weeks before labor day, around 1-1.5 hours per day. 

In the dead of winter with less sun light 1.5 hours was good, then I switched over to 1 hour when I started having trouble falling asleep.

I've had no crying spells. except I shed a natural tear or two while watching movies where I allowed myself to feel emotions lately since spring, that didn't seem to happen during winter.

 I've had no crazy manicy speech or crazy ideas like leaving my family and quitting my job. Overall most things have been good. Well except my sex drive. That has been non existent on zyprexa.

That one has been hard for my wife. It's been hard for me to deal with, sometimes it makes me want to say fuck it fine, no more meds. I've actually said that a bunch of times. But of course we all know that me on meds, is way better than me off meds. 

I don't know what it is when I'm off meds. I'm usually overly sensitive about everything. Loud noises make me heart start to jump and race. It's weird because It's like I turn into this introverted person when I'm off meds that needs to sit in a library all day just for pure quiets sake. Then I'm on meds and if anything I'm the loud one now. Laughing... super loud bellowing laughter. 

  
I become this different person off meds. When I'm on meds I'm more with at the source. I can handle loud noises, I can handle life surprises. When I'm off meds, everything is a disaster.   
As I'm putting these thoughts down, it sounds like I have a real depression off meds, which explains why zyprexa has stabilized a lot of these things for me. It's acting as my antidepressant and mood stabilizer.  Recently I stopped using my light lamp ( I don't know why, I just kinda assumed there was enough sun?) Bad idea. I started to dip into a mini depresh. When my wife and I realized this we were like DUH! So I started on my light lamp again 1 hour per day. After about 3-4days I started to gain improvements, negative thought patterns started to disappear seemingly on their own. Now were on day 12 I feel good now. 

I'm smiling again, laughing again. I can actually affirm to myself I am happy in my head without it feeling foreign or hard to say. Just before I stopped using my light lamp I was on a grind with my business. I would come home basically everyday after working my 9-5 job and I would work from around 5-8pm on my own business. That lasted probably 1-2 months. Then I just kinda stopped. I guess I'm wondering if this is a part of my illness or is it a normal person would just be burnt out and need a rest. 

There's a part of me that would like to tap into this commitment and drive and continue to work. But it seems what was just coming natural to me, just isn't there anymore. I had all this chutzpah and now I'm kinda like, oh there's HBO Max and rick and morty, that feels much more appealing. I want my swagger back. I want that constant state of flow I had for like two months. Where did that go and how do I get it back? Is that state normal, does it sound more manic? Do people have the constant ability to work on something again and again? Or is that what good habits are about?"
"Any good YouTube videos, apps, etc. for therapy? *anything*",2,mirv02,5,"Just curious what you all find helpful. I’m very new to actually trying to cope with bipolar (sans alcohol)... I got a free trial for peloton and have tried the meditation class a few times (although the attractive teachers sort of trigger some hypersexuality (eeek, sorry))

Just looking for anything I can use on my own. At home.

Dear RDiary,2,mirmpl,1,"March 24th 

I'm new to BP, I rather mean I've only just discovered I have it recently. A couple years ago or so. Is that a symptom of BP? No recollection of time? I've always felt I could never tell the difference between weeks ago or days ago. 

I'm still having trouble with identifying lows/highs I've got a good idea of the spirals. I believe I'm currently in one as so far I've backed out of a good friends wedding party, sent a rather hostile in my defense type of email to my boss, teetering on canceling my daughters second birthday party, and can't tell one emotion from the other. 

How does one handle this you ask? No clue. So I'm just sailing along trying to find something to quiet the anxiety. Oh anxiety, one feeling I've come to get to know on a very intimate basis. Who to talk to? Certainly not my spouse as during these tornado spirals I've beat it into myself that he's absolutely tired of me. 

Crying myself to sleep whilst wondering why there are such terrible things happening to somewhat decent people. Somewhat? I guess I feel as though I'm a decent person, I don't volunteer or donate to charity, does that make me a Villan? On the other hand I go out of my way to help others when I can, to the point where I exhaust myself in every form. My spouse tires of this quickly. I tell myself it's because of his culture, he grew up in a different world of not going above and beyond what you have to offer. Deep down I know the truth. That it's me that needs to stop. 

How does it go? Eat sleep repeat? Eat? Not so much or too much, never down the middle it seems. Sleep? I'm exhausted every day yet a quiet night in my somber bed is elusive. Repeat? Yes. Everyday feels like a copy and paste. Wake up, kids, work, home, dinner, bedtime, and the weight filled night. I always feel as though gravity sits on top of me rather then filling the space around me. Like air through my lips as I try to speak, it weighs my tounge down as though I can no longer form words. 

This reads as someone who has no notion to recollect their lost and wondering mind. Maybe I don't. Is that such a terrible thing? To be as lost as Poe felt in the Raven. Lost and found but not in a way anyone wants to be found. Does that make sense? As always questions that can never really be answered as diaries rarely ever speak.

With love, Me."

About a month into a depressive episode. My thoughts are pretty much a constant stream of why I should end it or how I could. I want to go to the hospital but I'm afraid.

Meds until they stop working and make everything worse, then I have to stop until being unmedicated gets too bad and I need to work up the motivation to get back on meds.

Insurance is a bitch, too, and money is a serious problem. But I also had an appointment with a free psychiatrist and I fucking managed to blow that off anyway. I can't break out of it and I don't know what to do, and no one around me knows what to say except ""why don't you just get some help.""

Feeling defeated. (Long post warning),3,mieru4,5,"NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS HERE.

Hi. I'm 22, and I've been struggling with many mental health issues since I was young. I never got any sort of help until I turned 18 because my parents didn't believe in mental illness. I sought out help from different psychologists, and they all said I just have general anxiety/depression and PTSD. Well life and other things happened, so I stopped seeing every therapist I've been to. (I can't ever commit to going anyways because I feel like they aren't listening to me, and they never could give me any medications to make me feel better.)

I haven't technically been diagnosed, but my family doctor thinks that there's a strong chance I am bipolar. I told her about my struggle with my mental health a couple years ago because I was at a really low point. I really just wanted to get some control over my life. So she tried me on I think 6 different anxiety and depression medications. Nothing ever changed for me for the better, if anything changed at all, I just felt worse/suicidal. The only thing she managed to help me with was getting my sleep schedule under control with trazedone. She said she would refer me to a psychiatrist because she felt I was bipolar, and there was nothing more she could do for me, which I understand. She's just a family doctor.

My only issue is I never got in touch with anyone about this referral. So I contacted my doctor's office and asked about it, and they said they would put it in again, and someone should be contacting me ""soon"". Well, that was 3 weeks ago. In the meantime, I've tried contacting literally every single psychiatrist in my area. They all have an excuse as to why they can't take me. ""You don't have a referral,"" ""We don't accept your insurance,"" ""We're not accepting new patients,"" ""We'll put you on a 5 week wait list."" When I get put on the wait list, I wait 6 weeks, call back, just for them to say ""oops your name was never on a list sorry""

I'M JUST DO DONE! I have no idea what to do anymore. I've literally been trying to get help for almost 5 years. I can't keep living like this. I am in compete misery every single day of my life. And it seems like no one cares. No one wants to help. I don't feel like I'm meant to live a long or happy life.

Gonna try posting to a few different subs. Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now."

My doctor put me on congentin to treat akithesia from latuda and the side effects were absolutely awful. I couldn’t sleep at night for the 4 nights that I took it, it made my brain super super foggy and made me feel drugged. Today has been the first day since I stopped taking it Saturday night that I feel alert and feel like myself. Is it possible for a drug to take about a week to wear off?

"Just got diagnosed with bipolar II and OCD. I start lexapro and lamictal. A little nervous, so any advice would be appreciated!",1,mi7sj1,11,"I’m a little nervous. I’m 27F, I’ve never taken medications. I just had my first psychiatry appointment today. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder II and a lil bit of OCD.

I’ll be starting lexapro and lamictal. I’ll be honest, and I know this sounds superficial. But I’m sad about the alcohol interaction part. I’m not a drinker. I don’t even keep a bar at home. But once a week, I like to have a glass or two of champagne.

Would I have to give that up entirely? Again I know something small like that seems so trivial, but it’s more the ritual surrounding it. Sitting on my rooftop. And reflect on the week. Have a drink and listen to music. I guess I could find an alternative!

Also any general advice or expectations with the medicine would be great! Idk why I’m nervous about it"
What you deserve,14,mi7ht0,6,"I find that language can really change the way we feel about ourselves and the world around us. I noticed that when I'm depressed, I start thinking that I don't deserve all these nice things. I don't deserve to be happy. I don't deserve to be loved. I don't deserve to have friends. Etc.

But I find that if I remove the word ""deserve"" from my vocabulary entirely, it really helps. Now if my brain tells me that I don't deserve something or if I start thinking that I don't deserve something, I stop and say ""But do I want it though?"" If I do, I'm going to do it anyway. Depression has nothing on me."
What med changes have you made that helped you lose weight?,3,mi6txm,12,I’m on Abilify 20 mg and my weight has not gone down at all. I know abilify is weight neutral but I’ve been gaining weight. I’m at my heaviest and it really affects my self esteem. I’ve also been taking metformin for a month and a half and so far nothing.
Anyone else’s memory gone to shit?,61,mi6l8v,26,"Hello. This has been bothering me since I was a kid but I always forgot to ask or bring it up. But I have lost my memory. Ever since I was a kid people would come up to me and say “hey remember when we did this or hey we met here and did this and this” even down to showing me the picture of us and I would look at them and say “ I’ve never seen you before in my life” and the things they said I did was weird and so out of character. But again I didn’t think to much of it. 

Fast forward to now when I recently started my meds and I had to call my doctor because I had never felt that sense of awareness before in my life and it scared the shit out of me. It was like my mind had unveiled itself and for the first time ever I was mentally present. I started going through my phone and my google photos and realized I remember nothing. Not only is my long term memory gone but my short term memory is completely shot. My mom will tell me about us having a conversation or doing something or going somewhere and I’d look at her and tell her she’s crazy because that never happened. She will tell me to go somewhere for her or get something and five minutes later can’t remember anything. Or I’ll be doing something like the dishes and I tell my self I have to put my plate away only to go back and it’s already done. At one point I thought I was stupid because my parents would always cuss me saying that I’m careless and forgetful.

The worst part for me is that I’ve cut off people for things or reasons that never happened. I feel like my brain is gaslighting me and I can’t tell reality from fiction. I have proof on my phone in my messages of things that I swear in my head never happened and I’ve lost so many relationships either from lashing out and remembering nothing or remembering something that never happened and never speaking to them again. I hate it here. 

Anybody else? 🙃🙃🙃"
What is normal? Is this normal?,3,mi4ibu,2,"I've had multiple doctors tell me things were or were not normal. They mostly conflict each other.

Anyway, a few months ago I took all my bipolar symptoms and sort of formed them as a separate entity in my head that is still a part of me. Its not really a separate voice but I think some of the doctors are calling it psychosis anyway?

Anywho is that normal??"

How to deal with post-manic shame,26,mi3ko7,11,"I’m pretty new to this whole being diagnosed dealio. I got diagnosed because I attempted suicide a couple times back in February after cheating on my partner and treating them in ways I can’t even begin to explain. Apparently those couple months where that happened was my first “manic episode” according to the psychiatrist who diagnosed me. 

Yesterday night I refused to take my meds because my brain told me (not literally but you know) that I didn’t have nip lol at and apparently I got into a huge fight with my roommate over literally nothing (it doesn’t help that he burst into my room in the middle of the night and started yelling at me, I don’t respond well to people yelling at me it’s a stupid way to communicate with people)

My question to y’all is how do you deal with your actions that you are embarrassed of that you did while manic? How do you deal with the actions you committed which hurt someone you care about while manic?"
Should I continue to call my loved one who is experiencing psychosis?,3,mi3hvn,9,"A family member was taken to an ER on Sunday and transferred to a psychiatric hospital on Monday. She is not officially diagnosed yet but she was able to give her doctor permission to discuss her treatment with me and I’ve been told she’s getting evaluated for bipolar disorder and is experiencing psychosis. She has been on a mood stabilizer for two days.

When I brought her to the hospital I promised her she was safe and that I’d call every day. She asked that I only call once a day but was otherwise very confused. 

Yesterday when I called she still seemed very out of it and was still only talking in a whisper. When I asked her how she was she responded with “what did you do?” In a quiet but accusatory tone. I told her I hadn’t done anything new- that I talked to her doctor and social worker as she’d asked and had just been waiting to talk to her. Then she said something like “my real mom” and then “I have to go” and hung up. 

I’m not sure what to make of it and I am afraid I’m agitating her. I asked for her doctor to call me back but they haven’t yet. I need to call within the next two hours so I don’t interrupt groups or meals. 

I’m just wondering if anyone who’s experienced these kinds of symptoms can offer any insight or guidance on what I should do about this call.

Thank you so much for reading!"

Your experiences with Abilify?,3,mi1qtn,12,"I've been pretty manic throughout the past few months -- not sleeping, making reckless decisions with sex and drugs, spending too much money, etc., so I was recently prescribed 2 mg Abilify. I've been on it for about 2 1/2 weeks. It has improved my life in some ways -- I'm sleeping again, definitely less manic, and I'm cleaning more, when I used to let my dishes and dirty clothes pile up for weeks. I'm more motivated to do hobbies like yoga and guitar. 

At the same time, I'm noticing potential cognitive impairments. I feel a bit anxious and wound up, when my other medications and meditating everyday basically made me anxiety-free before. I'm having a harder time focusing on my schoolwork. I'm currently writing my senior thesis. I'm super interested in my topic, so usually it's been easy to get in a flow state of research and writing, but it's been hard for me to think of the right words to say and it takes me much longer to write sentences. I'm more introverted these past couple weeks, and I find myself more drained around my friends than I used to be. I am a natural introvert, and I have been acting very extroverted this year, but I don't like the feeling of feeling the need to leave my friends when my social battery runs out. I've always been the type to only feel drained around people I don't know very well; I can usually spend hours on hours with my best friends and feel energized.

I said I'd give myself two weeks to see if the negative effects wear off, but they still seem to be there. It has achieved the purpose of significantly reducing my mania, but it seems to be triggering my anxiety and ADHD, so I'm not sure if I should stay on it. Anyone have experience with any of this with Abilify? Any advice on whether I should keep at it, or stop taking it?"
"Feeling hypomanic, but I don't want to mess with my meds",1,mi1k5w,2,"I thought I had it under control. I've been on lamictal, lithium and zyprexa. I've felt super good for the past two years, calm, quiet, not weird or intrusive. I've also, by some miracle, gained some creativity back. It's not consistent, but it does happen on occasion that I'll draw or write something. Honestly I'm very happy. Problem is I'm having manic episodes again. Not big things, but I'll spend lots of money (maybe this was caused by getting my stimulus?), get really into something new with full passion, then drop a week later and lose interest.

Basically I don't want to manipulate my meds anymore. I've already lost my sex drive, and I know if I increase my meds I'll lose my creativity completely. What should I do? What would you do? Maybe I should just practice more discipline? Or could this be normal for most people?"

Disability benefits?,4,mhzahy,15,Hey everyone. First time posting here. I have a question. My fiancée is bipolar and in the process of applying for disability benefits because of his bipolar. He has a hard time working because of his moods and outbursts at work. He is in the appeal process after 2 denials and has a lawyer working on the hearing right now.  I guess my question is...is there anyone who has gone through this process and successfully gotten their disability benefits?  It is pretty taxing on our relationship since I have now been supporting him for 17 months while he is going through the process! Any advise or tips or experiences would be appreciated. Thanks!

"Want to get help to see if I’m bipolar, but scared of being judged by my family",4,mhu10x,4,"I’ve recently been more and more concerned that I might be bipolar. I have health anxiety and OCD, so I’ve been attributing all of my symptoms like irritability, randomly losing feelings for people, periods of time where I get sad out of the blue, insomnia, and more to both the anxiety and OCD. However, I really don’t know if they’re the true cause of those symptoms. 

These symptoms have been affecting my blossoming relationship and I’m starting to realize how much of a problem a lot those things are. I really want to try to see a doctor or therapist about this, but I still live with my family. 

My family has not been very open and understanding when it comes to mental illness. When I first started struggling with my health anxiety and panic attacks they were very annoyed. Now, they don’t seem to understand my OCD tendencies and constantly bring them up. 

I still live with them and have to rely on them for a bit when it comes to appointments until I get my car (which is supposed to be soon) or move away (August, I believe). 

Does anyone have suggestions about how I should go about this?"

How do I stop being such a raging asshole?,4,mhqx5q,15,"I'm drunk and need to rant. If anyone has anything helpful to say at all please share I'm drowning.



Any time I feel any strong emotion my brain goes straight to anger. I end up riling myself up on purpose almost and just saying some of the most intentionally hurtful and awful things to the people I love. The hard part is once I calm down I regret every word I say and hate myself for it but in the moment I felt every ounce of hate that was put into those words. The hate isn't always towards that person but more a hatred of being alive. A raging anger that the only solution to is unattainable. And I apologize over and over, but you can only abuse someone so many times and still think your apology holds any weight. I'm full of blind rage all the time. Existing is excruciating and makes me want to fistfight whoever put me in this fucking torture chamber that is existence. I just get fucked and fucked and fucked by everyone that has the opportunity and at this point it seems like the game is designed for me to give up, for that to be the most logical option. The only way to win is not to play the fucking game."

lamotrigine and aripiprazole question,1,mhq7kd,8,"i've been on them for about two weeks now and instead of my regular depression episodes, i've just been pissed off. i haven't been crying as much, but i would be surprised if i didn't fracture my hand yesterday in a violent episode.

has anyone else experienced that? i brought it up to my psychiatrist and she didn't seem concerned but i wanted others opinions... if i'm not depressed, clearly the aripiprazole is doing its job ig? and i'm not sure if it's that or the lamotrigine i'm having this reaction to...

i know both can cause aggression, but is *violent* aggression normal? i've had breakdowns three times in the past week where i've hit something until i couldn't anymore (again would be very surprised if my hand isn't fractured) and if someone was around during one of my episodes, they'd 100% be the target of the rage whether they did something to trigger it or not.

i've also been very tempted to start cutting again during these anger episodes, luckily i've resisted that urge, but probably only because i couldn't move my fingers 

(for clarification, we're not sure if i have bipolar 1, bpd, or both. my symptoms all point to both though so i'm not sure if that'd effect anything. i'm used to having violent thoughts but i'm not used to acting on them)"
Bipolar day poem: I wonder what it looks like to them,27,mhodf5,4,"I wonder what it looks like to you.

Well-meaning messages

Heartfelt hashtags.

Motivational posters.

Celebrity tweets.

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you.

The silence.

The inability to speak 

Tears over nothing.

Fears that make no sense.

Well you deal with it too,

Chin up,

Make do.

&nbsp;


Let me tell you what it looks like for us.

A fake smile we forced, a sob we hid. 

Being tired. Somewhere deep in our bones.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what it looks like to us-

That inch of hope fuelling our hearts

We will scrounge for whatever light is left,

That is who we are.

And we were not made to give up without a fight.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what it looks like for us:

Trauma, friends, family, the city, the grades, the boss, the job,

The everything that tells us we’re not,

And us,

&nbsp;

Grasping.

Trying.

Striving.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what today looks like to us:

&nbsp;

A signal flare.

&nbsp;

Shot up across a darkened battlefield.

Illuminating solitary warriors, alone, outgunned,

Making weapons out of dirt and cold and blood and heart,

And doing battle,

Against the demons.

&nbsp;

The unbeatable kind.

The ones who can come at any time.

You think you have peace, but it's a ceasefire.

Then the chains will capture our limbs,

The cell close over our eyes,

And you on the other side.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what it looks like for us:

One more battle, one more time,

Whispering our battle cry:

Never give up, no matter what,

Fight on,

Fight goddammit.

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you, these suicide statistics.

We see fallen brothers and sisters,

We see horror that should not have been,

We see warriors who did not win.

We see war.

We see the cost.

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you:

These numbers, these rates, these implications and labels.

&nbsp;

We see each other.

The promise that we are not completely alone,

&nbsp;

Today is a single flare.

Lighting up a battlefield across the world.

Where courage and strength are not virtues,

But necessities.

And kindness is not charity,

But the only answer to horror.

Where despair can kill.

And hope is the final inch of who you are.

Where there is no retreat, no quarter, sometimes for weeks on end,

&nbsp;

Because tomorrow nothing will change for us.

The flare will darken.

The fuel used up. 

The attention will turn away.

And darkness remains. 

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you.

Exaggeration. Self-pity.

Self-indulgence. 

Florid, too long.

Yes,

It feels like too long.

&nbsp;

For when our comrades say;

“I’m too tired to continue.”

“There is no point left.”

And we see them drop their weapons.

Fall to their knees.

Watch their eyes go dark.

The demons triumphant, handing them the answer;

A knife, pills, tall ledges and unwritten letters.

&nbsp;

A part of us knows that this is how it is for some.

A part of us will stay. 

We will stay with them.

If nothing else we will stay and listen.

&nbsp;

We will stand with them.

Even as the light fades.

&nbsp;

Will remind them of who they are.

Who we are.

&nbsp;

There is a lot of cold in the world.

A cold that can fill your chest.

Sap everything you have left.

The cold of turned away faces.

The cold of insults and jeers and rolled eyes.

&nbsp;

The:

“Maybe they are right.”

“Maybe I am weak.”

But not for me,

For me,

Today is a memorial to my fallen comrades, my fallen heroes.

A celebration of those that have made it,

That make it still.

Because giving up,

Despite what it seems, is not in our nature."

I remember as soon as I found out with my dad that I was Bipolar, one of the first things he told me was to never mention my illness to anyone and that I should keep it a secret. Another thing that happened a year after finding out about my mental illness was that I admitted to them that I am an atheist. I've tried my best to believe in God, but the after hearing all these stories from the Bible never added up to what I've been learning from Science, and honestly if I had to choose between the 2, I have to choose Science because Science always has proof. So that right there adds more reasons to the shame bucket my parents have on me. I guess this is just me venting to the world about how I feel to be a Filipino American with bipolar disorder. Are there any Filipino Americans out there who have been dealing with my personal problem? I just want to know I am not alone.

Does bipolar include oversharing as a symptom?,21,mhkb76,15,"Does bipolar include oversharing as a symptom?  We seem to have this a lot, myself included.

Shifting gears from manic to depressed,2,mhk7y3,1,"Ya know when you finally realize that you’ve slipped into a depressive state and it’s like your actions finally make sense again? I’ve been feeling so off the last few days and have attributed it all to work stress (I teach 9th grade math). I got home today from teaching and immediately got in bed and about an hour of watching mindless YouTube videos later it finally clicked in my head. I’ve been running on mania all year and coming down from that and moving into a depressive state has fully exhausted me- but I’m glad I have more context for my actions and feelings now. 

An addition: I’ve never posted in this subreddit before but feel I should mention that I do attend therapy but am not currently medicated as it increased my su*cidal ideation too much. The brain chemistry of my mind is better left as it is and I fall on therapy to give me to tools to live with what I’ve got."

10mg abilify tired while sleeping,2,mhjrxn,1,So when I sleep I feel tired when I sleep of that makes any sense.

So I’m bipolar after all!! (Kalm... but also panik),5,mhjfag,3,"I’ve been having some elevated symptoms that I thought were my normal anxiety/depression mix, but I’ve just received a diagnosis from my therapist (type 2) and I feel kind of like I always had known but wasn’t wanting to accept it without hearing it from a professional (low key hoping it was something else) I told my employer (Starbucks) and I’m working towards a plan that can help me to move forward and thrive, but the way our conversation went today I’m not so sure how work will accommodate me in the future. They’re breathing down my neck about my opening my availability potentially, but I have no available energy left for any additional days on my schedule. Also my manager didn’t seem to fully grasp that I’m having manic episodes and need to go on medication/ maybe the hospital in the near future, thus compromising or limiting my ability to socialize and perform on some days. It was kind of disappointing to hear her reiterate all of my ongoing mental dialogue regarding my insecurities with my work performance as she told me my illness wasn’t a problem at the same time. But all of the things my manager wants me to work on are things I need to develop for myself first through therapy and will take some time so I’m not sure how I’ll meet those goals... All I want to do for myself is treat my disorder, learn how to grow and maybe/possibly thrive, and then use the tools I have to better myself for my greater good, but with all of my other obligations I just simply don’t see how I can satisfy or even please both obligations. Does anyone have advice?"

Anyone else read a lot of self help materials and feel like it doesn’t help?,8,mhi06j,10,"I spend a lot of my time in subs that are geared towards self help. I spend a lot of time on the internet reading self help materials. Anything that’s supposed to help me get better. But it feels like it doesn’t really work. I still feel unfulfilled and empty. I still suspect I have religious/moral OCD. I still get sleepy at work after changing my meds. Last week I burst into tears twice (different days) while working. I have to change my meds again to combat weight gain (I can’t maintain my weight for more than 3 months). The last time I remember being actually truly happy I was manic (my psychologist pointed that out to me, said I “missed mania”). I can’t get myself to “feel hopeful” about anything. I have a hard time looking on the bright side. When people dream they dream big. I  want to own my own house, a partner that cares, a dog, a good job and feeling like I’m not in some kind of depressed mood all the time."
Dealing with the subtle (or not so subtle) grandiosity that comes with elevated mood.,2,mhhefs,3,"As many with bipolar can likely identify with, as the flowers emerge and blossom, so does my mood.

This is pleasant, wonderful, and natural, but for myself with by bipolar, this means being caught off guard by the quirks that suddenly arise with this. The springtime lift in mood is normal, but the “oomph” I experience behind it is not.

This is inevitable, come spring, for me I find. Aside from any sickness or illness that has emerged from my bipolar mind in the past, I find my mind just works differently than people whose mind does not function like mine. 

As this happens, I find people misinterpret any amount of grandiosity I may experience. Maybe my girlfriend thinks I’m being cocky. Maybe I act like I know better. Maybe people think I am full of myself, judgy, condescending, etc. With no foundation I may feel like I am particularly brilliant. Usually, it’s subtle. Subtle enough that people don’t pick up on it being abnormal, but instead take it the wrong way.

I can’t always maintain complete awareness of my behaviors nor analyze exactly how things come across when I say them, before I say them. But I do my best. I feel guilt and shame when I realize that I am coming off grandiose in a way that someone interprets in a negative way. I feel like a fool.

Humility and spirituality are wonderful at helping me manage this specifically. Much of this is normal aspects of the human condition that get tweaked in the way they are expressed due to the sudden elevated mood.

I feel frustrated, as aside from the illness that often comes along with a bipolar brain, my “spunky” brain just generally functions differently than most, and most don’t understand that or what it means.

Can others relate? How do you communicate these things to others who don’t notice or fully understand these subtle (or not so subtle) behaviors?"

Okay, now on to the sad shit.
As most of you know by now, I lost one of my best friends to suicide 6 months ago. This wasn’t my first funeral, or my last. Even in the 6 months since he’s passed, I’ve been to 2 more funerals. I started writing this song shortly after Zach’s death. And it took me over 4 months to complete, because every time I tried to write I just broke down. I could only ever write a line or two at a time. And a lot of what I had originally written ended up getting scrapped because the reality is, 4 minutes could never be enough to say everything I want to say. 4 minutes could never be enough to tell you how beautiful of a person Zach truly was, or how much he meant to me. But 4 minutes was all I had, and this is what I ended up with. This song means a lot to me. I didn’t even use auto tune or hardly any editing on the song at all (aside from a very minimal harmony) because I wanted it to be as real as possible. It was even harder considering how many times I started crying while recording. Which I’m honestly a little self conscious about, but it just felt right. Releasing this song is very bittersweet. I’m sad, of course. And anxious. But in a way, this was healing. I feel like this was finally a way for me to really say goodbye.
Zach, I love you so much. And I hope I made you proud.”"

Birth control might have F-ed up hormones,2,mhexul,4,"Hi I am new to this subreddit :)

I just started talking 100mg lamotrigine less than week ago. Beforehand I was taking 50 and felt pretty good, no crazy ups and downs and was able to get some schoolwork done (my bipolar is comorbid w ADD which makes shit really hard). About two weeks ago though I started the patch which is a hormonal birth control method. I think I made a huge mistake. I know that hormonal changes can trigger pretty bad episodes and I think thats what I did. I think I fucked up my hormones bc as soon as I started using the patch I started feeling like my old self again: extremely irritable, hard to control my emotions, unmotivated to do any work, unable to focus, crying for no reason. I took it off last night after not even two weeks because I just couldnt take it. I was doing so well and now I dont know if I just have to deal with a whole depressive episode (my depressive episodes last around 3 months) or if I will go back to normal soon. It also doesnt help that I wont be able to talk to my psychiatrist for another couple weeks and my parents cant find out I went on birth control. Does anyone have a similar experience? what should I do?"

How can I help,2,mhej9r,2,"My SO is not on any meds. She was prescribed seroquel and took herself off it after three weeks because she didn't like the side effects. I'm so worried. She's been depressed and is pulling away from me and her friends recently. She started a new job with a long commute so she's driving 2 hrs in the am, working, and then another 2 hr drive in the evening. All she is doing is sleeping. We don't live together, so that makes things even harder. She stopped calling and texting completely. She said she doesn't have any time anymore. I get that to an extent, but a 30 second text to say goodnight can't be too much, right? Even when she's in the bathroom? I know she has time then. I'd be there in an instant if she'd let me. To make her dinner or help with laundry. Anything to make her days easier. But she won't let me. She won't even answer my calls. 

I'm just lost and it hurts so much to not be there. So how do I help her? I'm sending a text in the am and pm to let her know I'm here for anything. What else can I do? I won't just show up at her place because that would not go over well. She lives with family, so I know she's not alone completely. I just worry. A lot."

"Recently diagnosed bipolar, could really use some help",9,mhe403,14,"Hi everyone, I (22f) was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I also have severe anxiety and am already taking lexapro, but I’ll be starting on Lamictal today. I am extremely nervous and wondering if anybody has any advice for me?

Honestly, I am having a very hard time coping with this diagnosis. My brother is bipolar, and I always felt that his mood swings were much more severe than mine. I’ve always thought mania was categorized by long term mood swings, but my moods seem to change on a daily basis. One day I’m feeling euphoric, spending lots of money, high energy, social, etc, while the next day I’m depressed, severely anxious, panic attacks, suicidal, etc. I was always under the impression that mania fits tend to last longer (such as a week at a time)? I guess I am just having a lot of trouble accepting that I am bipolar. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I feel so horrible about myself right now for the emotional toll I’ve taken on my friends and family, and I just don’t feel like I’ll ever get better. Thanks for reading."
I got approved for ketamine treatment today!,29,mhdzon,11,"There are very few places that does ketamine treatment in my country. I had to go through an interview and everything. Two hours of going through all my medical history. It was exhausting. Especially when talking about the sexual abuse from my childhood and my PTSD symptoms. But I got through it. And I got approved! That was not a given at all. I was SO nervous. I was sure I was going to be declined. That my issues weren't bad enough. But they basically said I was the perfect candidate. They especially focused on my anxiety problems.

I am both excited and nervous. I have tried so many treatments. So many drugs that didn't work, stopped working, made things worse or had too bad side effects to be worth it. So I thought ""Fuck it! I've got nothing to lose by trying."" and sent them an email on Sunday. They got back to me in less than 48 hours and scheduled a video interview already today. They're getting back to me next week, after the Easter weekend, to set up an appointment for the infusions.

 I'll be going through three infusions over ten days and they want to coordinate with my psychiatrist for followup talk therapy. I'm not sure how she feels about ketamine treatments. It's still kind of controversial over here. But I'm an grown ass man. I have the right to choose what treatment I accept so fuck that. I'm going to try."
Traumatic experience yesterday and now I can't focus. Please help I have a lot of schoolwork to do.,5,mhdtt5,6,"Some serious stuff went down with a friend yesterday.  It all lasted several hours and was very frightening.  It's all worked out and everyone is safe but I keep breaking down and crying and I feel so tired. 

I *just* stabilized a few days ago from a month and a half of complete hell and am way behind on schoolwork.  I was finally able to focus and was getting great work done. But since the incident, I've been crying and having suicidal thoughts and I can't focus on my work because I keep thinking about it. The incident is resolved now, but I think the whole thing just brought up feelings of the kind of stuff I dealt with in my childhood on a regular basis.

Regardless, I need to know how to focus. I have two huge assignments due Friday and I've already got extensions on both of them for bipolar I just wasn't expecting this. My profs won't move it back any more. I'm talking to my psych and adjusting meds but I don't know what else to do.  My friends have all got stuff going on and can't deal with this right now.  If I fail these assignments, I fail my classes."

Take your meds it's worth it :),20,mhdb27,11,"Really guys take your meds and don't give up!

I've been taking

* **Lamotrigine** 100 mg 2x a day
* **Sodium valproate** 300 mg 2x a day
* **Venlafaxine** 75 mg 2x a day
* **Piracetam** 800 mg 2x a day
* **Olanzapine** 5 mg 1x a day
* **Quetiapine** 200 mg 1x a day

Yeah quite a lot of meds but I'm under ADHD diagnosis so it's going to be more, but look past that. Just taking 2 meds could help a ton. I've been doing so much recently feeling pretty stable and better than worse having my mood last through the whole day on a high level of productivity and feeling happy about life. Hanging out at the playground with my brother. Helping out cutting wood, working in a mobile truck tire changing service with my grandfather. Working in the garden, playing games, playing cards it's all interesting and I actually like the things I'm doing!

It's all about getting the right med cocktail, it might take some twists and waiting but in the long run it's worth it!

Lactating on Lamictal??,4,mhbs2k,8,"A while ago my breasts started occasionally leaking a little breast milk here and there; the doctor said it's from the Lamotrigine.

I'm just curious if anyone else has had this issue and what their resolution was if any. Lamotrigine does so, SO well for me literally everywhere else. It saved my life, and I can't imagine coming off of it. But I also can't imagine walking around with painful breasts and having to essentially milk myself to find relief. I'm at a crossroads. I have an appointment with my doctor soon, was just curious to hear any other stories if they're out there."

They were pretty tolerable of my issues with bi polar, calling off, some incidents at work, the normal stuff. My father passed the day after I turned 26. After his 4 year battle with diabetes loosing both legs 100 lbs and most of his personality it was a blessing that he passed. For me not so much, I was his main care taker, changed his bandages his diapers and his blood through in home dialysis. I watched up close as he slowly decayed and fell apart. Anyways, after he passed i dropped all my meds went back to the drugs and started down the road of a 4 month bender that's hard to remember. I woke up without an apartment, without any friends, and without my 35$ an hour paying job. Now I'm sobered up and held up in my sisters spare room with absolutely no direction or clue what the fuck I'm doing. I started dropshipping but it never caught on because of all the road blocks and issues I've dumped more money into trying to start internet businesses and stuff I'm just so so lost. I've been praying for some relief, some direction some sort of purpose other than waking up just to sigh that I made it through another night alive. Every night when I fall asleep, I hope that I don't wake up, I don't want pain I don't want to kill myself I'm not teetering on the edge, I'm just really tired I'm exhausted from trying. Even know all I do is wake up sit around stare at the wall, go over my failures. Some days I try to regroup and get started on something but nothing ever works out for me. Idk what to do but I went from being the man, the guy that everyone loved and counted on family and friends, to being non existent to all of those same people and even to myself. If I disappeared, if died and my body never showed up. Nobody would even know or care. I'm sure my mom would call someone eventually after a few months maybe but I don't even know about that. I'm really not a bad person I'm an addict but I've never stolen from family and friends, they have always trusted me I've been a good person a leader and an entrapenur. But I've hit this rock bottom that I can't escape from and now that my very last business opportunity has flopped I've got nothing to live for or look forward to. I need purpose I need to do things I need to help people. Supply people with what they need to make them happy. Anything other than sitting here day after day after day doing nothing but grieving and feeling like a total loser. Fuck"
I’m pregnant and wondering how’s this is all going to affect me in the long run.,1,mhap7l,9,Hey guys so I recently found out that I’m pregnant. I’m early on and I found this out because my emotions and mood swings have been off the wall lately and then I took three test and they all came back positive af. My fiancé and me are happy but I’m deep down freaking out since this is my first pregnancy. With my bipolar I’m already an anxious mess of a person. So I’m wondering if there is anybody out there that will tell me how did there pregnancy go and how there emotions were affected by this either by them being pregnant or if you had a partner with bipolar that is also pregnant. I’m trying not to stress so much but I feel like now things trigger me even more and my emotional outburst have been even worse. I want to research some more as well because I feel bad for my fiancé who has to deal with me now being more emotional and also dealing with preparing for a child. My fiancé understands what I’m going through and talked to him about this but I’ve lashed out on him and when I would come back from a high emotional state I would feel so guilty and start crying. I’m just curious how this is going to go throughout the whole pregnancy and would like advice.

Does anyone else have both illusions of grandeur and self hate during mania?,12,mh9rma,5,"I read a lot about illusions of grandeur and feeling like a god during manic phases.

I certainly have some of this but my manic episodes are often characterized by this overwhelming feeling that I have utterly wasted my life and I hate myself for it. I do feel like I am a genius and absolutely  smarter than everyone else around me but at the same time I get irrationally angry at myself for not going to a prestigious college or moving to a larger city or working for a more high profile company etc.

Sometimes I can utilize the manic energy to really be productive and I’ll lock myself in my room for months and work on my programming skills, reading research papers etc and  really do emerge from mania for the better.

Other times I just have this overwhelming feeling that I need to get out of my city as quickly as I can and that everyone around me is stupid and not doing anything to better the world and completely alienate myself from my friends because I think I’m better than all of them. I essentially have months long panic attacks that prevent me from actually doing anything productive and I end up just obsessively looking at jobs in other cities and daydreaming about life in a big city where I am working for some company that is solving cancer or sending people to the moon.

Obviously there is an illusion of grandeur but it is so intertwined with self hate and anger at my life decisions. Just wondering if anyone else experiences similar feelings during mania or if or if most people truly feel euphoric and like a god."

For quite a while she's been in a cycle of self medicating then sobriety. It's been much the same cycle with me, but clearly it's taking a heavier toll on her. Her boyfriend has pretty much told her to kick rocks, her dad is at the end of his rope. She's like a sister to me, I don't want to cut her loose but she's starting to make that an inevitability. I finally get how my parents felt when I was on heroin.

Difficult to pinpoint when this shift in her behavior really got started, but it's been bad the past year. When she's sober, things are fine. Sure she has her moments, but she's still a very pleasant person. Just one sip too many of the booze and it's like a switch flips in her head. I can see it when it's about to happen, and I really don't know how to counter it. If I remove myself from the situation, to her that's me turning my back on her. If I try and explain how her behavior is hurting me, she just brings up messed up things I've done. If I just submit and agree that I'm a piece of shit, she will just continue to tell me what a piece of shit I am.

It always ends with me hitting my limit, snapping on her. I leave, she calls me later and apologizes. Last night was a big one. She made a comment about my luck with women, biggest insecurity of mine. I just exploded, idk why I can't control myself knowing she doesn't mean it. I told her, ""This is why (boyfriend) left, nobody wants to put up with this shit."" and once again walked out. That one was a little too close to home. To get back at me she called my family and told them all these awful things. Of course they didn't believe her, but they're totally against me seeing her ever again. I'm an adult, but approval does matter, she was a big part of my life.

This morning she called, I figured this was the apology. Nope, just calling to accuse me of stealing her vape. Not sure if she fell asleep and woke up to drink more or just drank all night. I told her to talk to me when she's sober, then hung up.

Thing is, I can't fuckin' blame her. She's been surrounded by enablers her entire adult life, myself included. Just because I enable her a little bit less than everyone else doesn't mean I'm the good guy. Her relationship with her father is not great, I'm really all she's got. Where do I go from here? I've got my own issues to deal with now, this is too much. Maybe losing me for a little while would push her to go to rehab or something, but I'm worried it'll make her hurt herself. Sorry this is a rambling mess, I'm worn out. I'd prefer a hug, but advice is cool. I hope you're all doing well."
What's your Manic Anger like?,9,mh7yd5,8,"Hey folks  
  
I've been thinking about the kind of intense anger I get during my worse manic episodes.  Sometimes it's little things that set me off (the usual irritability maxed out), but sometimes, when I get in a bit of a state, i can spend days just looking for stuff to be furious about.  I get angry at genuine big world issues, but in a way that I wouldn't during other times.  
  
Do you guys get this?  What does your manic anger tend to focus on, if anything?"
Working in a call center,3,mh7tyj,4,"I have bipolar disorder and like everyone bipolar person, I have my good and bad days but I’m hanging in there. My biggest problem is that I work at a call center and I totally hate my job like I would wake up every day and I would rather to die and not go to work and I just can’t leave cause I’m in debt and I won’t be able to pay the bills if l left. Has anyone had a similar experience and How did you overcome that ?"
"Wrote this at an underground concert 3 yrs ago. After that episode, I’ve been stable. Many people post about feeling like they don’t know their personality outside bipolar. I 100% felt that way, but now finally found mine underneath. Sharing in case someone needs to hear that’s possible—I know I did",10,mh77br,2,
Constant anxiety attacks after trauma,4,mh6l25,3,"Saturday night I experienced a very traumatic event. Normally I get maybe one anxiety attack a week that requires a Valium. Since Saturday, I have had 1-2 per day. Sometimes I wake up out of my sleep with my heart racing and having an anxiety attack, which I have to take a Valium in order to make it stop and go back to sleep. 

I am not comfortable taking benzos this frequently. How can I stop these anxiety attacks from happening? Or lessen the severity? Is this PTSD?"
Looking for advice or recommendations,1,mh68yc,3,"Hello, my fiance was recently diagnosed bipolar (Cyclothymic) and I'm hoping to find some guidance on how to navigate certain situations. For the most part, I think I do a decent job of supporting her when she needs someone to be there for her. However, sometimes I let the things that are said and done, get the best of me. I lose sight of the big picture and start blaming her for the things she's doing instead of realizing she's dealing with something that I'll never truly, completely understand. It's very difficult to find the line between being supportive and enabling. Is enabling even a factor? Is it wrong of me to hold her accountable for her actions? Are there certain things you've experienced that help you de-escalate situations? Any advice that would help me be as supportive as possible, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
Close family member died,6,mh5hhu,4,"He was a good guy, loving, caring, funny, and I loved him, but I feel nothing, no sadness, no pain for his death.  I’ve never felt the way others do with the death of others.  It doesn’t hurt me, doesn’t give me the “normal” reactions that others have.  It makes me feel like I’m broken to not feel anything.

Anyone else experience this?"
Rapid Cycling?,7,mh491r,3,"Three nights ago, I didn’t sleep. My mind was racing with thoughts of elation and moving to San Diego. Yesterday, I stayed in bed all day with depressive thoughts, sleeping 20 hours.

I’m concerned. I believe my anti-convulsant needs to be raised and my anti-depressant needs to be lowered in order to stay functional.

I was able to work, I was able to avoid any outbursts or disruptive behavior, but it’s still troubling me.

Does anyone have experience with rapid cycling? What does it feel like? What do you do to smooth out the abrupt and intense highs and lows?"
Bipolar friend committed suicide,519,mh45dh,74,"Hi everyone
I’m diagnosed bipolar 1 and so was my best friend. We bonded a lot over this; it brought us closer. 
We saw the same psychiatrist, we discussed how we were feeling, did lots of “normal” things and I loved her to bits. 

I saw her last week and she wasn’t feeling all that good. I woke up the next morning to the news that she jumped off a cliff and died. 
I’m still in shock, unsure how to feel. 
Partly I feel like my poor baby won’t feel the pain anymore, but I also feel ridden with guilt. 

It’s sent me in a whirlwind. I think I’m in a mixed episode, feeling all over the place."
That time of the year... anyone else?,25,mh40zb,30,"I always noticed that the time of the year when we enter daylight savings time and usually comes hand in hand with a beautiful hypomanic episode. Anyone else experience this?

The worst of it all is being on meds, being aware of what is happening and that we are entering that phase, notifying best friends and closed ones and no one seem to do anything, or they simply don’t know what to do.

I’ve been on lithium for close to 2 years and that was the time I had my last hypomanic episode. Lately I’ve been feeling the same and my brain starts screaming “go party”, “go do drugs”, “sleep less”, and so on... 

This is basically a venting post but also want to hear who’s with me, and what tips you give. They tell me to go sleep on time and go for walks and eat healthy but it might be a tiny too late for that. They also suggested putting me on abilify but I think it only works if you are not in a hypomanic episode."
"Hypo-depressiveness, Obsession, and Emotional Anorexia",6,mh3xt9,4,"These past few weeks have been an escalating play of hypomanic behavior in three acts. I've seen these patterns before. Thankfully because of meds and therapy, I'm better equipped to handle them. But the usual signs come out. I become a workaholic, sleep less (<4 a night), then a hyposexual state with an increased need for sexual gratification.   


This is particularly tough because I'm a Sex Addict (Step 6 Gang, woo). So I've been in contact with my sponsor on a daily basis to be accountable. However, I also have a fairly obsessive personality. It has helped me in the past by fueling my drive to further my career, but I would say that it's caused more harm than created any good.

Thus, I enter into the predictable downswing after the rising high. I've felt withdrawn, anxious, and lost. This morning I walked right by a coworker without a word and they got a little offended. My head has been so busy with a lot of conflicting thoughts, especially about my gender identity and career path. You know, everyday life problems. The kind that I can't stop and process because I never get a moment alone unless it's at work.   


But I've found myself hiding away in my obsessions. vTubers/ Youtubers, a few games, some stories I've been binging on, even making little bits of money on Prolific. I really noticed it when I went to check Reddit and Twitter and I had seen, upvoted, and/or commented on nearly every post on my timeline. I was refreshing and looking for something to hold onto. Something to push back the swelling darkness in my head.   


Then comes the truly negative thought amidst all of this. This feeling of panic when I catch myself in an obsessive spiral. This awful thought to cut it all off. Stop consuming things that I enjoy, uninstall apps, pull away from online friends. Starve the obsession until It goes away. This isn't so unfamiliar to me, thanks to therapy and recovery I have identified that this is a consistent pattern in my life. ""Purging"" as it is called, or as my sponsor put it ""Emotional Anorexia"". This need to feel cleansed when you experience a crisis, that the only way to feel whole again is through starving the self of joy. It's self harm in an emotional and mental sense. I've got plenty of traumatic mental scars to prove it.

Does anyone else go through this? See these same patterns in your life? Or at least that someone might kind of get what I'm going through? I'm reaching out to connect instead of cut myself off. This subreddit has been a pillar of strength for me for a while now, and I want to add my own experience to  the dialogue here.  


Thank you for reading."
Anyone here want to be my friend?,1,mh3c49,2,"I know this is the wrong subreddit but I don't mind having a buddy who can write or draw. I actually need someone with this so I can get neurological help. 

I have a lot of mental issues like Learning, intellectual disabilites  and social problems. And it seems things had changed for years on how bipolar savants see others. And no I'm not saying you are all savants. 

I had made some list on /makingfriends but it's wasn't that successful and it seems you and see these savants seem to like being parents or children. 

Uhh speak to me if you want but I do need a writer."
"How to give ""support"" to a friend with bipolar 2?",6,mh271b,9,"I don't have bipolar myself, so if this is insensitive for this sub, please forgive my ignorance, and I'll happily remove it

So what does ""support"" from a friend look like from your perspective? Is it a stable personality, or accommodating the bipolar fluctuations, or what? My friend has said before that they like to have their feelings validated when they're upset, but I'm actually the opposite (the ""punch me in the face with the truth that I'm being dumb and let me deal with whatever hurt feelings accompany it"" kind), so I don't know how to validate something without trying to get to the bottom of _why_ they feel that way and then try to find ways to fix it. I also don't know how to validate some of the more extreme feelings without simply attributing it to bipolar and inadvertently diminishing it.

I know it differs person to person, but I'd like to hear your different ideas of what you like to see as support from a friend so that I'm more informed."
Lazy Doctors,6,mh1tnx,4,"Hey folks, it turns out I *also* have hypothyroidism—maybe. 

I say maybe because off of one blood test at my first meeting with a new primary care physician, the new doc “diagnosed” me without putting down any notes about a diagnosis and prescribed some thyroid hormones. I never had the option to talk to him about the new meds because he had a nurse call me ten minutes to their closing hours to just walk me through how to take them. 

Never mind that I am *bipolar* and embarrassingly obvious about being in a manic phase when he deigned to see me for that first appointment. Never mind that I might have questions about how this will interact with my meds (the internet says no, fortunately) or my condition as a whole (the internet says yes, unfortunately). Never mind that I might have wanted to follow up and make sure that this is just a thyroid problem and not some other health issue that has secondary thyroid effects. 

I have an appointment with a new doc on the 7th. If this one doesn’t take the minimum amount of effort for personalized care, I am going to burn this city to the ground."
Just looking for some virtual hugs,3,mh1oyj,3,"TL;DR below.

I’ve had my diagnosis for 4yrs now, two of which were torture and two of which I was lucky to overall stability.

A little under two months ago I began feeling myself slightly manic. Sleeping less, rapid speech, racing thoughts and an uncharacteristic restlessness. I made a few poor decisions when I began noticing theses symptoms, such as not buying and taking my daily 200mg of lamotrigine once I ran out, I decided to have a drink for the first time in the past two years, etc.

I worsened things, began buying things with my partner’s (together for almost 3 yrs) money which we could not afford. Knowing myself, I told her to keep everything in her account and give me the bare minimum, otherwise I’d probably spend it. I needed her support.

Thinks quickly took a turn for the worse in a relationship for many reasons, one of them being her inhabilita or unwillingness to try and understand what I was going through. She had seen me go through depression and mixed episodes, but never a manic one. We ended up breaking up un Friday on rather friendly terms (I could stay at our apartment until I found a place I could afford, she would even help me pack).

But on Saturday after coming home from seeing friends we got into a huge fight which ended up with her on top of me, trying to choke me, punching me, and finally, yelling into my ear “I hate you, I hope you die alone you goddamn bipolar.” The punch that hurt me the worst.

I left my house running as soon as she stopped and have been hoping from one’s friend’s house to another. Waiting for the police report to come through, getting my things in order so I can go pick up my dog...

Anyways, I’m feeling like shit. I know her aggression is not my fault, but I can’t help but think how none of it would of happened if I wasn’t bipolar. If I weren’t manic. If I had said the right things instead of letting my irritated self speak.

TL;DR Partner attacked me during a fight because she couldn’t handle a rather brief hypo-manic phase I’m going through."

What a day,7,mh0yil,3,"So my day started out alright. I got a rejection email from a job. Okay, whatever I'll just apply for 5 more jobs. I get therapy and I'm talking about how my dad said ""why did you let yourself get so big"" and the resulting fall out from that. I have not forgiven my dad. I talk about some of the issues brought up in therapy with my mom. Okay, keeping my distance from dad. I go and start cooking dinner for my family. Dad comes in the kitchen while I'm cooking and turns off the water when I'm right about to use it. I'm already mad about yesterday so I'm pissed and say ""get out of the kitchen"" he responds by saying ""shut the fuck up"". I go splash some water on him and start yelling who knows what.

I ended up packing up all my stuff. While I was packing I said, ""how does it feel to be abusive"". My mom talked to him and apparently he was willing to go stay with his sister but like fuck him I was already halfway packed, he didn't stop me before and he only did it out of prompting from my mom

So I finally returned to my apartment. Even brought my cat back.

Drive wasn't bad thankfully.

I get back and go hang out with my friend and then we play a video game that reminds me of a fall out I had with a gym I just feel energy suddenly drained from me. 

I go back home and I'm getting ready to eat my latuda snack while all ruminating over this gym thing and then they email me at freaking 1 am.

So I responded and we'll I'm all freaking wired and I can't sleep. Probably could if I ate enough to take latuda. But now I have to start the latuda snack all over because it has been too long since I stopped.

Why did I let myself get so big?

Because I'm fucking bipolar, which on top of not having energy to exercise it also has medication that causes you to gain weight.

What's your fucking excuse dad?

Also fuck you dad, because I'm pretty sure it's your genetics that gave me this."
I just donated my salary to a friend who has cancer.,32,mh0ted,1,"I broke my phone last weekend, dented my newly purchased cricut machine, accidentally bleached and expensive bag which i saved in months to buy. I was getting depressed with all and couldn't start my crafts because i was feeling very bad. 

Just last night i was told that one of my friend has cancer and with covid and all she was delaying her chemo because she cant afford it yet because se took less load on work and less pay. I immediately sent her the money i got on my latest salary to start it. Im not rich but i have a few savings and i can delay my craft business and plans to purchase the rest of my equipment.

I feel both bad and good. Bad as now how much bad luck i got but at the same time good that i still was able to do a good thing."
Dealing with grief.,5,mh0a50,4,Lost my mother last week and I don't really know what to do anymore I am trying to drown myself in work. Trying to cope but it's just very difficult. Also feels like I have been manic because I don't think I have mourned properly. I just miss her so much.
I cannot pull myself out of this cycle and I literally feel like I’m having a mental breakdown.,3,mgzup5,7,"So I recently found out that I’m bipolar and I can’t stop obsessing over it. I’m super fucking exhausted. I can’t get my brain to calm down. I can’t stop researching bipolar horror stories. I’ve been manic for 5 days now and now I’m sad and manic at the same time. I need sleep so bad but moment I’m alone with my thoughts, I start sobbing. I’m currently waiting for my therapist to get back to me but idk what to do until then. 


I don’t have anyone to talk to, and that’s been super hard. The few friends I do have are still taking breaks from me after my last manic episode (at least I think this is what happened) and I totally understand. But I’m so lonely with all these thoughts sometimes that it feels like I’m going insane. Like what do I do with these incredibly fast flows of information and feelings?!



I know I’m not a danger to myself or others, but I’m so unhappy lately that it’s hard to find motivation to carry on. why do I have to live like this? Why can’t I just be manic for forever? 😭"
Anyone have thyroid/neck issues as part of the package?,1,mgzozm,5,"I’ve been struggling with chronic neck pain for about 8 months to the point I’m doing acupuncture to avoid “pain management” which is just more drugs. My acupuncturist gently suggested I get my thyroid levels tested (it has been awhile so not a bad idea) and even some bloodwork to check for autoimmune diseases...

Anybody in this community have any experiences with those sort of issues? I definitely identify and have accepted my diagnosis but sometimes I wonder if there may be something else going on with my thyroid more specifically.

letter to my teenage self,6,mgz4lq,1,"You ran from one school from a perceived threat that *wasn't* real.  I know you didn't realize it was a delusion but you shook up your life for no reason. You come back over a year later because you realized you're too fucked up to complete that more rigorous high school program. You've been told you're smart but maybe the blackouts and catatonia don't make you feel very smart, or very lovable. People don't hate you as much as you think they do, but if you're always asking if they hate you they will start to wonder why they don't. Your family is more reliable than you think.

I'm supposed to be writing this to tell you what to expect in the coming years. Instead, I would like to press Ctrl+Z on the entire fucking script. My alterations and recommendations are as follows:

Stop running from your problems. Go see a doctor. No one thinks the way you do unless their brain is broken. No one is out to get you.

Being smart doesn't matter. Do your fucking homework. You're going to go to university eventually and flounder because you have no god damn work ethic. Please start doing your homework before you get worse. They're going to put you on these pills that make your brain feel like a swamp. If you go into the swampy-brain era with some semblance of work ethic maybe you can still learn stuff (even if it takes you five times longer).

For the love of God, nobody really cares what you do and *they're going to forget*. The people that already don't like you are going to laugh or cringe no matter what you do. Start trying to make everyone laugh on purpose instead. The people who laugh when you're actually trying to be entertaining are the ones that matter.

Your siblings and your parents don't really understand what's wrong yet. They will but they're in denial. There's family history; it's just going to take one doctor for them to connect the dots. They might not understand for a while longer, but they love you and will support you in the worst of times. Especially mum.

People in your teenage years are mean. Not just teenagers. Even some of the coaches and teachers who seemed to have gotten into the wrong profession (or maybe they're just old and jaded). Don't worry. There will always be enough good people around for you to be okay.

You're going to have a lot of fun. When you're having fun please remember to brush your teeth before you go to sleep. Just because you're drunk or having a sleepover does not mean you get to let your teeth yellow!!!

People will like you better when you're older and less obviously neurotic. It's not their fault that you're a bit nuts. People also like you specifically because of that nuttiness so count your blessings when you can. You're going to feel loved eventually, even if you don't right now. It's going to take a few years. Maybe it's your hormones? Maybe it's the fact that you kept choosing to hang out with people that gave you panic attacks. Maybe you did that because of hormones. Teenagers.

I hope you heed my advice but at the same time maybe I'm sage and cool now because you were such a fuck-up. Building character and whatnot? Don't worry, a decade later and you're still a fuck-up but at least now you don't feel so lost and afraid. Be safe. Oh and wear sunscreen in Cuba, the sun intensity is not the same at the equator you complete idiot."
Fighting off suicidal thoughts is so hard,8,mgyzit,4,"The only reason why I’m still living is that it would make my family and friends sad if I died. If I didn’t have any family and friends I would’ve definitively killed myself by now. I don’t like living. Living is such a chore. I’m tired of not being allowed to end my own life. It’s so frustrating.

Sometimes I feel like the only way I could get any enjoyment out of my life is if I escaped to some house far out in nature and just watched TV and soaked in the sun with no responsibilities. But then repeating that everyday would get repetitive and I would lose joy in living again. And then I would off myself anyways.

Why am I not allowed to kill myself?

Edit: Please positive comments only. I’m sort of on the edge right now."
Lithium,3,mgyukw,6,"I take 1200 mg of Lithium daily and my levels are about 1.0.

Anyone else have to speak formally to hide mental quirks?,15,mgyqhb,8,"Tldr: It’s hard to find words and keep up a playful conversation.

I have a bad case of adhd, and moderate bipolar. Every since I was younger, everyone always thought I acted much older than i am. When I got neuropsych testing at 14, my verbal reasoning was 96th percentile, and processing speed 8th percentile.

Basically, I can think good, but I receive and process information very slowly. Mood stabilizers certainly haven’t helped with that.

Oversharing my experiences with hypersexuality and then my complete lack of interest in sex,4,mgwwq5,2,"Get ready for some oversharing 🙃

I’ve had a couple “hyper sexual events” where I’ve:

- made it a goal to make out with as many people at the club (usually 4-6 people each night) 
- basically had clothed sex on the dance floor
- lost my virginity to a complete stranger, don’t remember his name or face
- slept with more people a week later, don’t remember them either
- exposed myself on Omegle for days without sleep
- started online sexual relationships with strangers I met online (ghosted once I realized what I was actually doing)

...but when I’m not in a hyper sexual mood I’m so turned off by the thought of relationships and sex. Men disgust me and I’M SORRY, ITS NOT PERSONAL AT ALL, I SWEAR. Even feeling the eyes of men looking at me at the gym (since it’s the only thing open and it’s the only place where I’m surrounded by others) makes my skin crawl and I want to disappear into the ground. 

I still haven’t fully been diagnosed as bipolar yet (the doctor said my reaction to mood stabilizers will tell) so I’m wondering if I’m just a sexual person and I’m in denial and/or I’m overreacting. I definitely have depressive episodes but it’s harder to point out hypomania.

I just think it’s weird since I’ve never had a crush, never truly desired to be in a relationship (meaning I never put myself out there), I don’t even have any male friends since no guys ever even seemed to like me platonically...and then I lose my virginity to someone I spoke to for 5 minutes on tinder. I just don’t think it’s adding up...but my friend says I’ve just been having fun.

I’m so in war with my own thoughts because my friend is telling me to not to put myself in a “bipolar box” and psych myself out and give myself symptoms, and then a doctor is telling me I might me bipolar, and here I am definitely thinking I’m bipolar one minute and then doubting everything the next. 

I’m so hung up on remembering my past so I can identify manic or hypo manic symptoms, I feel like I have to “prove” to my doctor how shitty I’m feeling since it doesn’t seem like they’re understanding, or maybe that’s just me overthinking his words. Idk why I’m so (for the lack of better words) desperate to be bipolar. I guess I finally just want a definitive answer as to why I can’t just out exercise my depression, why I can’t just be ok being promiscuous once in a while, why can’t I just stop thinking negative thoughts.

I just want answers.

I’m looking for in-person therapy but I’m so scared to be told they don’t believe me. No one ever believe me."

Happy World Bipolar Day! Let’s pay an ode to the fabulously flawed...,43,mgvodx,4,"The celebrities, the rockstars, the singers, the writers, the artists,the geniuses... basically everyday people of all walks of life and class.

This is not a day just to acknowledge the existence of an illness... but a day to celebrate those who share our experiences and their lust for life. This is the day to embrace our battles, our successes, and our demons. Please accept yourself for who you are and educate yourself about the disorder to understand and get to love who you are as an individual. Not an “illness”... not a “psycho”... “whacko” ...”sicko”... or “insane.” 

Bipolar disorder does not define a person. A person can live day to day with a disorder and still be successful! 

Here is a link to some notable people who have BP and  did incredible things in their lifetimes (Ik lol Wikipedia, there are other legit sources but I found this one to be the most convenient:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_bipolar_disorder

This list includes famous people who share our disorder but still were able to express themselves in such ways that some of them left behind a mark on the world. Celebrities such as Carrie Fisher, Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, Winston Churchill, Vincent Van Gough (btw, Happy Birthday Vincent!) and many others are mentioned. 

ALWAYS REMEMBER... there were many greats through-ought history who had bipolar disorder and used it as a drive to fuel passion. Having a disorder or mental illness does not mean you cannot be great. Nobody has to accept you but yourself. Validation does not come from a desperate need to be accepted. Validation comes from within. Be good to yourself when nobody else will and love yourself for who you are. 
These are the many lessons in life I have learned since my diagnosis of BP1 and ADD 3 years ago when I was 16. I am now 19 and didn’t believe I’d get this far in life or even be alive. Sometimes our hearts hang low but we gotta stand and fight for our will. We are all fighters in this battle but can’t be shattered with a heart of steel.

Dream confusion after lack of sleep,1,mgvl6e,3,"So I have not been getting much sleep (2-4 hours a night for 3 months) and the other night I fell asleep but had vivid dreams and would wake up in weird places from my dreams. Psychosis was there and I began to see things from my dreams for a few minutes then I assume went back to sleep and kept dreaming. This lead to things in my house being moved, many outgoing phone calls made, and waking up standing outside. Has anything similar happened to anyone else?"
Being voluntarily hospitalized?,2,mgviy6,5,"I was diagnosed with bipolar after a psych ward stay in 2019. I was on lamictal until last March when I went off my meds and things have gotten a lot worse. 

I notice very clear patterns of hypo mania and severe depression, last month I was very close to overdosing on pills but flushed them. I also had a bit of a psychotic break in December but didn’t go then either. I have a psych evaluation with a new doc tomorrow and am considering asking to be hospitalized. 

Does anyone have personal experience with this? I’m also struggling with adderall addiction where I’ll finish my script in a week and don’t really trust myself anymore. I feel myself slipping out of my mania into depression atm. Last month, I didn’t shower for a week and couldn’t brush my teeth. Just lying in bed all day on my phone. I’m 17 rn and failing school so it’s overwhelming for me. 

I’m tapering on lamictal and taking ability but still am unstable. Is it okay to go to the hospital just to adjust to meds and be put on a routine? I feel like I’m not bad enough right now but my suicidal thoughts a few weeks ago were so scary I don’t trust myself."
I was prescribed lithium yesterday but I don’t want to start it,12,mgvfyk,13,"I’m scared of the side effects. Weight gain and acne. And me not having a good track record of ever drinking water. I’m always constantly thirsty. I never listen to what my body tells me. And I have very little impulse control. And a shit memory. Yea I could get a phone reminder. But I have at least 10 reminders a day. Most of which I ignore. I’m on lamictal with no side effects which I was hoping would be my “miracle drug”. It’s not cause I’m rapid cycling. 
I don’t feel like I would consistently take lithium. And probably not want to be on it and always think of stopping to take it. Maybe impulsively. I happily take lamictal cause there is no negative. And the one thing I know for sure is everyone always has to pee and drink water. I don’t think I will comply. 
And weight gain and acne scare me honestly cause I’ve only built up a facade of high self esteem."

I understand this subreddit isnt for a person like me but i have questions,3,mgufyc,3,"Long story short my mother lost her parental right 3 years ago. Now i understand that is a devastating development in someones life but my grandparents the ones i live in knew she had some sort if mental illness. At first we thought it was adhd or ocd but about 2 years ago when she was sent to a behavioral hospital during a manic episode she was finally diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic manic breakdowns she was immediately on the right medications to make sure she was stable she moved in with me and my grandparents (her parents) to make sure she wont get hurt, arrested, etc... but about a month ago she had a horrible psychotic breakdown. She attack my grandmother and broke her arm fast forward to the past two weeks. She has been off seraquil (idk how to spell it) it was the medication that fought with her pain meds that caused the fight. Now the reason it’s important is because she is really manic now but not like psychotic but she constantly jumping from thing to thing from subject to subject in fact she screamed at me for turning off a light and helping her put groceries in the car these are a few examples l and since most people here have bipolar i wanted advice. How do i deal with this? In a way that i fan both be focused on my school work   And help my elderly grandparents 

TL;DR: My mom has bipolar i want/need advice to deal with it mentally."
I'll probably never get a job,5,mgub6f,7,"I haven't had a paid job in years. Seven, to be exact. In my last position, I was a volunteer and earned a measly stipend. I was fired from it. I've never had a salaried job and I am approaching my 33rd birthday next week. 

It fucking sucks, guys. I did this online grad program at a top school (i.e. it was expensive) and now I just feel like it was a huge waste of my husband's hard earned money and we'll be paying back the debt with money we don't really have. I thought it would get me somewhere, but no one will give me the slightest chance because of my huge-ass resume gap. 

My parents try to tell me I ""wouldn't want to work for those companies anyway,"" but where does that really get me? It doesn't get me a job, that's for sure. It's nice that my mom could stay home and raise us when we were little, but life is way more expensive now. My medical bills alone are another mortgage payment. 

I just feel like I'm stuck, not being able to fully build the life I want to live, because of this stupid brain disease. Happy World Bipolar Day everyone."
Anyone else have an obsession with a numbers?,3,mgu24e,7,"Dudes and dudettes I think I’m on the journey towards mania (maybe hypomania, even though I’m bd1 idk the difference) but I have a very odd obsession with the number 7 right now, like I absolutely hate it. I can’t stand that number, I’m counting everything, and can’t have anything that is the number 7 at all.
I have other symptoms, increased sexual drive, impulsively doing things, spending money, making plans, can’t shut up, super high self importance, just a lot. 
But Idk anyone else that has an obsession with numbers when going manic. Does anyone else have a similar obsession?"
Eyes,2,mgtykj,5,I do this weird thing where I look to one direction and almost strain my eyes looking so far in the corner of my eye. It started when I was in 3rd grade and had moved schools. I did it a lot as a kid because I remember my dad fussing about it thinking I was rolling my eyes. I’m about to transition from a job that makes me miserable and work 60+ hrs a week but make 50kUSD and to a new job working 40 hrs and making 25kUSD. IM THRILLED I was able to find employment within a three week search but I’m stressed as I’m also moving in with a friend. And the eye thing is back.

7 months clean and sober and in a bad depressive episode,12,mgtsuo,9,"So I got clean and sober September 14 of last year after over a year of hell that I caused myself. Went to treatment and immediately started working AA. I did IOP, 90 meetings in 90 days, worked my steps, everything that was suggested. It's saved my life. I've had bad days but they were nothing like when I was drinking and drugging...I've become a pretty prominent member of my homegroup and try to help others by going to halfway houses and holding meetings and hosting my own zoom meetings. I've hit a terrible depressive episode this last week. Constant crying. Sleeping. Suicidal ideations. It's been awful. It's made me wanna say fuck the program, come off the meds and revert to my old habits. I know that's not the way. I know the meds work or they have the last 7 months. I've been a little overwhelmed. I haven't had a stable job in sobriety. I've broken my wrist and need surgery. My therapist of 4 years basically said I was doing so well, it was time for me to fly and now my insurance doesn't cover my sessions with her. I've gained 40 lbs in sobriety. I've officially ended a friendship with my bff of 14 years. So there's a lot going on in my head. I went to a meeting today and ended up stepping out and crying to my sponsor. I'm in no place mentally to be chairing meetings and trying to sponsor other women which makes me feel like a disappointment. I'm not having cravings to drink or use. And I so desperately want to get back on the right track but I also just want to sleep. This sucks."
Do you have questions about GeneSight testing?,1,mgthjg,3,"My mom works at a doctor's office and she mentioned to me that a rep from the GeneSight company is coming in on Thursday to talk to the doctor about the service.

Let me know in the next 24ish hours and hopefully I can get an answer for you :)

If you're unfamiliar with GeneSight, this is the description from their [website](http://genesight.com):
>GeneSight Psychotropic is a pharmacogenomic test which means that it analyzes how your genes may affect medication outcomes. The GeneSight test analyzes clinically important genetic variations in your DNA. Results can inform your doctor about how you may break down or respond to certain medications commonly prescribed to treat depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions."
Shortcuts to life during mania,9,mgtfcn,4,During my extreme manic periods I would try coming up with ways that could make me rich and famous etc..also just generally believing I had the secrets/cheat codes to life and I knew stuff everyone else didn’t. Hell last year I thought I had psychic powers and that I was one of only a small group of people in the world that have this. Like I was in a special club or something. Luckily that was only for a week and I snapped out of it and haven’t entertained those ideas since. Still hard to believe it got that bad. I still get second hand embarrassment when I remember. Anyone else dealt with something similar?

If I had to commit suicide...,8,mgs8a0,7,"I would rather die manic than depressed.

I'm more self-aware and empathetic when I'm down. I probably can plan better on how to die, and will be more responsible with finances so my family doesn't have to deal with it.  But I would die alone. I'm usually so miserable people aren't too fond of me during these times. It's too sad.

However, a selfish part of me wants to die manic and paranoid. Not caring. Immediate relief. A legit concern I have is making a dumb mistake and living with the consequences because I didn't aim or calculate right. But at least when I'm manic, reality is distorted. I'm the fun friend, people seem to like me and it's a big happy middle finger to some cause."

Neck pain and BP1,1,mgrud3,1,"Mods lemme know if this is out of scope, but this sub has been a life saver and I’m looking for some advice.

I was diagnosed with BP1 in 2018 after the only major full blown mania episode I’ve had. Then I had a long depressive period but meds stabilized me and I’ve been cautiously weaning off of them under the guidance of my PDOC. In 2019 I added Lamotrigine to the lithium carbonate I was already taking so I could wean off of the lithium because I wanted a less physically taxing med. About June 2020 I was completely off lithium and taking 150 mg of Lamotrigine, *BUT this is where I’m looking for some answers...*

Around that time I developed chronic neck and back pain which I’m still experiencing. I’m doing physical therapy, yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and it’s manageable finally but just not gone >_<

Could my neck pain be related to me stopping the lithium?

Could there be something else going on since our bodies can be so mysterious sometimes?

I’m going to order blood work to check my thyroid and vitamin levels, and also to check for an autoimmune disease. 

Just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or has been diagnosed as BP1-2 (which I identify with) but maybe something else was triggering it, like thyroid problems, etc. 

Currently I’m on 100mg of lamotrigine at bedtime. Any thoughts or advice deeply and humbly appreciated. Thank you :’)

Yours truly,

Can hypomania fluctuate?,4,mgrt4t,9,"Can a hypomanic episode vary in intensity, even to the point where some days you almost feel normal (but still a little “up”)? Since I started Abilify I’ve been all over the place. Consistently elevated/energetic above my baseline, but my sleep hasn’t been bad every single night. Most nights I get around 4 hours, but sometimes I get 0 and sometimes I get a full 8. Im also painting and sewing and knitting and posting on Reddit way more than normal and I’ve had no appetite and those are normal signs of hypomania for me but it could just be side effects. 

I’m seeing my psych tomorrow, I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I don’t know if I’ve been hypo for two months or if it’s been on and off or what could be going on. Usually it accelerates really fast for me and I stop sleeping altogether for a consistent period of time so this is unusual for me."

Anxious about medication,1,mgo0sw,1,"So hello I just need to whine a minute.. I’m going through a lot right now I had to come off one med I’d been on for awhile (saphris) because we increased the dosage and I got akathesia which was hell so I discontinued taking that.. then my nurse practitioner switched me to topamax at a low dose which sounded promising but boy was I wrong, I’ve been so sick from it I lost close to 8lbs in two weeks and got bad dizziness spells.. I tried to stick with it because I wanted it to work but I stopped taking it yesterday.. it’s frustrating. The other issue is during all this I’ve also been taking lexapro and basically by itself so my moods have been rocky to say the least. 

I see my nurse practitioner again tomorrow and hopefully get something that helps.. I just needed to vent .. figuring out meds is so damn hard and I’m usually so quiet about things I try not to bother people with my problems but I’ve just felt so bad.

My mood cycle has been more stable since I have started lithium so maybe that means I am bipolar, but I can’t help stop thinking that I actually don’t have any mental disorder.

Did anyone else feel like Joker was kinda offensive?,8,mgmja8,19,It was a good movie but while watching it I couldn’t help but notice how they portray people with mental illness. They make it seem like we are all crazy and violent. Plus the whole “insane asylum” scene rubbed me the wrong way. What do yall think?
I am so confused and angry AITA,10,mgm95d,4,"This happened last night and I still feel confused and angry:

So my husband and I winding down for the evening watching Star Trek. This got us into debate, whether if we found a planet like earth, with the same position of their sun, if the life on that planet would be the same as here on earth. We didn’t agree with each other lol. 

That was ok, healthy debate is great. I ended up interrupting his point of view, rude and wrong, on my part. He let me know and I apologized then we got back into the debate. While I was stating my opinion, he did the same thing. I let him finish and I messed up by saying “now that you are done interrupting me, what I was saying....” it wasn’t in a mean way or angry or aggressive. I thought we were having a healthy debate. But that took it from a debate to how I was rude and being mean, how I was acting like I am innocent and never accept when I am wrong and it is his fault. What?! I did apologize for interrupting and I explained that I didn’t mean it like that, it wasn’t in a tone of anger or aggression. I was talking with a clear and concise opinion. I get that I don’t always have a clear mind, but this was a great time because I could get a thought out and that is something I am not very good at doing for the most part. So I replayed everything from my point of view and said that I remember everything and that I was there and it was a discussion and I admit to interrupting and apologized but I was not being aggressive or upset. His reaction: “what is the definition of bipolar?” (He said it before telling me that I am seeing it wrong and that I can’t remember what I said and how I was mean when I was talking) I went to bed alone, and I figured that after a night of rest it would be fine, nope. He was irritated and said it was because I was a jerk last night and I can’t apologize or accept that I was. The fact I can remember the conversation today and the reason it went from a debate to a disagreement is something doesn’t happen often, but it does happen. 

I admit with my bipolar I can’t always express my feelings. My feelings can even change in an instant. I am the worst person to talk about my feelings, hell I avoid them as much as possible. I also know when I get upset or angry I have said things I don’t mean, and yes sometime hurtful. But sometimes, I have a clear head, I can express and remember what was talked about and what I say. This was one of those times.

Just because we disagree doesn’t mean it is bipolar talking. I can have feelings and opinions, it doesn’t mean it is bipolar talking. Don’t sit here and disagree and then bring up bipolar like it is the reason or telling me I don’t remember because of bipolar. If I have a good day it isn’t bipolar, if I get emotional it isn’t bipolar. I am allowed to have good and bad days and it not be bipolar!

I FUCKING HATE BIPOLAR!! 

I don’t use it as an excuse for when I mess up. Don’t use it when we don’t agree. I apologized for interrupting and being rude, but I don’t feel I need to apologize for anything else. He won’t apologize so it has been dropped. He has said that I am the only one that is still upset about it. 

I am."

I don’t CHOOSE to be sad, emotionless, apathetic or manic, energetic, irritable, anxious, etc etc. My friend doesn’t struggle with mental illness at all so it struck a nerve, they have no room to talk if they don’t know what it’s like.

But because I rarely don't sleep and have may have BPD they have prescribed this drug. For the people who have taken Quetiapine for a while, how did you guys deal with the weight gain? I can't workout more than just taking walks due to my back injury.  Is there any other prescribed drugs that can help you with this such as Topiramate or anything else?"

Shaking Passive Suicidalness?,3,mgl39l,7,"Hi! 29f Bipolar II here, (Unmedicated 5 years, currently actively seeking a doctor to help with meds and therapy but having trouble finding someone I trust. It’s a top top top priority though) 

So I’ve been really freaked out about the future and been having the “Um...you obviously need to kill yourself”, and “this would all be a lot simpler if I were dead.” thoughts.

It’s been a long time since I felt like this for more than a day, probably close to 5 years, and I was hoping someone has some advice for shaking those thoughts? (I am not currently able to convince myself people need/care/love me at this time unfortunately so I’m not having success “living for others” atm.) 

Again, i am actively seeking out a therapist and doctor for meds, but any bit of advice I can get for the meantime would really help. Thank you!!"

Reality cooler than a fairytale,3,mgklh2,2,"Hi!
I'm (21M)
I've got bipolar disorder since 2013, but it was diagnosed on 2019. I don't even know I was born with this or not.
On my graduation's 2nd exam, my hand stopped to write and kinda had feeling of brain just reset everything type. I just waited till the exam ending and couldn't attend to next exam after that day. I had laid to the bed like a dead body all the time and just wanted to die. I couldn't suicide, 'cause my heart had started beating so much when I stood. All in my brain for two months was-
""So now what?! how can people naturally die fast and it can't be cure. AIDS. But where I'm gonna get the virus?! I can't even stand.
Maybe blood cancer. Yes, it's curable but if it would hit so bad, there is probability""
So I started mumbling and changing my sleeping position over and over. I even begged to my Creator to give cancer. 
Guess what. I've got hodgkin's lymphoma stage 4b. Maybe He had accepted my wish and want to change my life's difficulty to 'Death March' or it's just a coincidence, who knows! 
After the ride of ABVD, GCD, nivolumab immunotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant; I ended up on a psychiatric hospital for hypomania. They had treated me like some angels. I came back to that bed again where everything had started. But now all I want to say is; 
when the life goes bad to worse everytime that means your Creator saying Congratulations! you just level up so the difficulty a bit more!
If you don't believe in God, it's okay! Just know yourself and rule your life with positivity!

I'm really sorry for my bad English. I'm still learning. Wish me luck! I'll write here again someday."
Medication and pharmacy rant today,4,mgj7t7,3,"I was prescribed some anti depressants and mood stabilizers yesterday at the doctor. I’ve been very eager to start taking them and doing my therapy since things have gotten really bad lately. Well I went to pick everything up at the pharmacy but they claimed they never received anything from my doctor. The lady asks what they’re for so I tell her the names of the medication and she very loudly says “ OH! Antidepressants and mood stabilizers right?”. Everyone in the pharmacy heard which was real embarrassing. So, I call my doctor office and they confirmed it was sent over. Cool, I go back to the pharmacy like five hours later and they.still.don’t.have.it. My doctors office is closed so I waited until this morning to call. The receptionist lady claims they’ve been having issues with the electronic system so she seems me to the triage nurse...? Who doesn’t answer so I leave a voicemail. 

I’m incredibly anxious about all of this now and just want the damn meds and to vent lol."
Normal fluctuations in sex drive vs hypomania,8,mgiz7v,3,"\[Obligatory first post apology\]

So after a particularly difficult hypomanic/mixed episode, my psychiatrist recently told me (21F) a week ago that she thinks I am some sort of bipolar, and placed me on Lamotrigine. I'm still dealing with accepting it, and figuring out which moods and behaviors are part of my ""baseline"" and which ones are part of an episode. My question for you guys is, if you already have a pretty high baseline sex drive, can you tell if your sex drive and impulsive sexual behaviors are related to (hypo)mania, and if so how? I don't want to pathologize a little early 20's sluttiness, but I also don't want to do something I'll regret."

Eventually the ambulance came and took them to a hospital where they were diagnosed with bipolar disorder and stayed for about 2 weeks. By the end they recovered a lot but they changed, they believe that god talked to them stating that they were going to save the family, write many books and essays, thinks that they’re a such a genius that they dont need to take an iq test to prove it (they’re smart but they never bragged and boast let alone call themselves a genius), and that a politician (don’t remember which) will know they’re name and they will become president. Are they still in the episode? And if so how long does this last? They’re not manic anymore but I don’t know what’s happening"

Mixed episode advice,1,mggqjq,1,"So ever since starting Sodium Valproate around Christmas, I have noticed a massive change in my bipolar symptoms! Generally feeling stable, not having episodes, no sleepless nights. Up until the last 3-4 weeks. Started off having one sleepless night 3 weeks ago. Also thought I should add that i’m in the process of potentially getting a Borderline diagnosis.

The last few days I have noticed my bipolar symptoms plummeting. 3 nights ago I had a sleepless night! Slept the next night. And now I’m entering night two (in a row) of not sleeping. Also having fluctuations of being severely depressed, then hypo/manic. 

I ended a friendship with my ex a week ago and am wondering if that is potentially enough to trigger an episode? Also considering I potentially have borderline and that they were my “favourite person”, it would make sense that it would trigger my borderline/abandonment issues. I also should add that I have made another big life choice in stopping my studies! 

Despite seeking help mid last year. I am still pretty new to working out my triggers and learning how bipolar affects me personally.

I have an appointment with my psychologist tomorrow. But I just feel so alone right now! And need to rant about this to people who understand what I am experiencing. 

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!"

First Step,6,mgfcml,2,"I’m 90% sure I have Bipolar Disorder. 

I had what I think to be a manic episode about 18 months ago. Became psychotic in my room after a week of not sleeping and not really needing sleep. It was so weird, I was bouncing around the place initially listening to music having the time of my life until I literally started to see demons and had bugs crawling all over me. That’s when the fun ended. I was weirdly together the whole time though. I was acutely aware of what was happening and knew it wasn’t real. I just remember looking in the mirror and thinking how is this my life? I had recently emigrated so no one close to me knew what was up or heard my distress thankfully. It was easy to hide so to speak. Prior to this I had been applauded at family events for being so entertaining when I’m usually fairly reserved at those kind of things. I was definitely “on one” for about a month. 

Bipolar runs in my family and I’ve had bouts of depression in the past through school and college. Thought it was just normal shitty feelings, until this episode happened. I’ve never had the balls to seek help for it until now. Have quite a lot going on at the moment in my personal life, so I’ve booked an appointment with the doctor for Thursday. I’m hoping I don’t chicken out of telling him last minute. Just dunno how to approach this with my family once I get referred to a psychiatrist. I know it will take its toll on them. But I feel as the years go on I am more and more consumed by stress and worry and this has been on my mind too long. It may just have been psychosis from lack of sleep, it’s hard to tell. Hence seeking professional help! Although it’s been a long time coming, I’m proud of myself for making the first step."
Working towards assesment,2,mgfa1i,5,"I posted a rant roughly a month ago, things have improved since then.


Not that I’ve heard anything from the counceling service I was reffered to, but I know they are probably swamped.


Inspired and encouraged by this community I looked up more testimonials and came accross the Bipolar UK website, and discovered their mood scale and diary template!


I’m very excited to have found something that will hopefully finally help me put the chaos in my head out in the world in a constructive and somewhat objective manner.


It will help me to have something to show my GP to explain what I feel is going on.


In past ai often read about the advice of putting things to paper, but I always imagined vague essays or diaries or dry lists of symptoms and had no clue where to start.
The scale does not always reflect precisely what I experience, but it’s at least a guideline.

Diagnosed outside of US,1,mge7s2,2,Just wondering if anyone has experience being diagnosed outside of the US and then moving back. I was diagnosed in an EU country where I am currently resident but will have to return to the US in the next year and am worried about not being able to get my meds.

Medication dilemma,1,mge5dm,1,"I'll try to keep this short.

A couple of months ago, I started getting sharp burning pains in my kidneys with chronic fatigue. I had a course of antibiotics, not much change. Got all of the tests done at the doctor. No bad results on paper.

Then they mentioned that Covid (which I caught on December 1st) can cause organ damage but it's preliminary research at this point. The chronic fatigue is really debilitating and I'm struggling to get through the day at work. I'm currently on lithium which is processed by the kidneys. If I do have kidney damage (which I suspect is the case), I assume that the fatigue will be lessened if I come off the lithium.

Having said that, if I do come off it, it will take a long damn time. First I need to wait until my next blood test (which might not even show kidney function specifically). Then I need to wait for the results. Then if I slowly taper off, it will take several weeks. I really just want the fatigue to go away now, especially since I may be starting a new job soon.

I even had the vaccine and it's not much better. In fact, the burning kidney pain is back. I really don't know what to do here."

The nasty words plague my emotions with self-hatred and hatred toward accusers. And there were times when they drove me paranoid and into extreme anger. This is why the hell I am quick to make excuses/explanations, or apologize.

I do receive professional help and the  paranoia is reduced, but it can resurface during high amounts of stress. My bipolar disorder is driving this paranoia to the maximum.

I am gullible. When someone tells me something, I easily believe it. Even I tried to shake it off, my mind forces me to believe it. Even if it's wrong. To make this statement short, it's hard not to be convinced.

First time in therapy // Is this normal?,2,mg7rh6,4,"I was recently diagnosed with BP 1 and referred to a therapy place. I had my first session tonight and it was awful. The therapist was painfully awkward. I noticed it on the phone when making an appointment with her, but I assumed that she had a lot going on that day and I didn't give it much thought. It's bad in person though... A lot of awkward silences, avoiding eye contact, stumbling over her words, seemingly racking her brain to think of things to ask me, and near the end of our session she was turning to look at the clock every two minutes. It made me very uncomfortable and made her seem incompetent. I'm going to go one more time to give her a fair chance, but I really want to ask for a referral to a different place if the therapist acts like this next week as well.

That being said, is that normal for therapy? I googled this and some people said therapists often don't say anything and pause to see if you will fill it. Is that true? Would you also want a new therapist if in a similar situation as I am? I just want to know if I'm overreacting because I don't love the idea of being in therapy as it is.

Thanks and sorry that this was kind of all over the place."

I'm 39 M being depressed, angry moody whatever since I was a teen or even a little younger. I'm a really short guy 5'2 and a think that once I got to the age where I started to realize people significantly judged me for that, it started a downward cycle. Only reason I lead with that is I try and think about if I had any trauma or really terrible childhood memories or anything and I really can't think of any. Throughout HS I was always a huge risk taker, in trouble with the law, and have always been a major major pot head. In my late 20s I was building some positive momentum in my life, graduated college with a CS degree and eventually got a really good job, met my wife, etc. I've always used weed to self medicate and I know that now, just using it to dull everything. Couple years back I got a medical card and then fast forward a little more and COVID hit. Started working from home, and even as a 25+ year smoker I just went nuts with it. Constant. I finally got to the point where I had a melt down. I won't get into details of that but it resulted in the hospital, terrifying my wife and after a little bit deciding that I couldn't smoke anymore. After the withdrawals of stopping weed calmed down and I started to get my ""shit together"" about 1% my general prac DR. started me on lexapro. The next day my severe depression, anxiety and OCD stopped, but I also felt like a useless lump stuck in neutral. Zero motivation for anything, work, food, sex, bathing anything just out of it. After a few like 5 months the same Doctor moved me over to effexor. Seemed about the same, but a little while in I relapsed with weed hard for several months until another meltdown. That was early Feb. I stopped smoking again and decided after about a month to get of the antidepressant too. So here I am now. If you have read my incoherent rambling so far thank you. I've always had strong and long mood swings. Like months of hating everything, zero interest in anything and then suddently out of no where about a week of insane focus, motivation, non stop goal crushing. I think I got into a little bit of rhythm that knowing if i was going into a mania phase, at least try and use it to my advantage. But since I have gone off the effexor, about a month now, I've never been more insanely irritable and angry all the time. Like x 10. My sister has several mental health issues, has been diagnosed BP by one doctor but doesn't currently take anything. We are always waiting for the other shoe to drop there though. I guess I just don't know what to do anymore. I'd just like to be a calmer, happier go with the flow type of person. I'm very blessed in a lot of ways, I try to be greatful. I hear all teh time exercise you will feel better, but it's like impossible when you're just to angry and tired. Next week I'm going to start going to talk therapy again, maybe that will help, but I feel as I get older I'm just going further off the deep end. You can webmd yourself to death, am I depressed, developing schizo or pychosis type of stuff, am I BP. I just don't fucking know. I'm sick of tired of being sick and tired. I know mods on a lot of these types of forums are very strict about what you write so if I said anything against the group I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated and want to feel better. =("

The shame of everything I’ve done and all the stupid mistakes i made while I was manic becomes too much.  All of the time and years I’ve wasted being depressed and doing drugs to try to manage the pain.  My health problems make it feel like it’s the end of the world. I’ve been trying so hard to make things right and some days it’s just like why am I even bothering if this is how I’m going to feel? I’m sorry if this is triggering for anyone who reads this I just don’t feel like anyone I know can ever understand how I feel right now.
I gave my parents my wallet.,12,mg729p,4,"I hit an all time low. I was in a mixed episode and in a low moment I realized the shopping sprees (which included a bounce house this time) were out of control. I could not control my impulses and needed help before I dug myself even deeper.

Now it is real awkward trying to side-step questions when my daughter asks why my mom has my wallet when I ask her for it so I can drive. And it really sucks when you want a Frappe but have no means of paying for it.

Less than 24 hours ago I was screaming, “I’m so happy” while simultaneously sobbing and laughing. It had been so long since I felt manic. Damn, did it feel good until it didn’t."

"Bipolar is almost definitely genetic in my family, my dad had it, I have it, and now I think my cousin has it. How do I reach out to him?",4,mg5117,3,"My younger cousin, I think he’s 17/18, I just found out has been doing drugs, becoming randomly destructive, and has been kicked out of his parents’ house. The thing is, all the actions they’re describing are almost verbatim what my dad did as a kid. The issue is my cousin also came out as gay, and our family is old style catholic italians- they blame him being gay for the behavior, not making the connection I think I’m making. 

I think I have his number, and have a way to get his new one if it’s changed. For any of you who went down that road before getting treatment, what did you need to hear then? What helped you get into treatment? I haven’t reached out yet because I only just received this info yesterday, and I don’t want to further ostracize him. My grandmother already said she didn’t know if me and my sister would ever see him again..."
I survived,4,mg4v51,2,"Its been a little over three months, and I'm doing much better. I am scarred both physically and mentally. Looking back it now feels like I finally got a breath of air after drowning for so long. I am left with an experience that, fortunately for others, I have no words to describe the horrors of. The depression that almost killed me felt like an encounter with one of the eldritch terrors and it drove me into a madness of despair from which the only way out I saw was death. I am relieved to be past it, and scared to know it can happen again. For now though I will be grateful that I can know some sort of peace. What I long for now is a warm cup of coffee and the lap of someone gentle to rest my tired head on. I can rest now. I can finally rest."

"Psychs, prescriptions and therapy",1,mg2vy4,2,"Psychs, prescriptions and therapy

Today I went for my 3rd session with my psychiatrist to discuss how things are going with the meds I’m prescibed. I’ve been increasing my dosage every couple weeks since my diagnosis in early Feb.

I’m now on 100mg of Quetiapine and we had the aim of increasing me to 125 following this sesh. Today following my chat with him, he decided to keep me on 100mg and said he’d like to refer me to a psychologist &amp; I would go back to see him in 3 months. He said that this was because he didn’t want to increase the dose every time as it takes time.

Part of me knows it’s posi that he’s keeping me on this amount for good reasons etc but I’m out of whack.

Idk why but I feel like this is just a complete unknown area for me. I know therapy is a good thing but I’ve never had experience of psychologists before and it worries me that it could trigger something in me or g-d forbid I get sectioned if I say the wrong thing. I know that’s totally out of pocket and irrational I’m just feeling out of sorts.

Feel like an utter mess at the minute lol. Has anyone similar experience(s) with any of the above?"
My therapist said i'm transitioning into mania but i'm not sure what to do about it,2,mg2lyg,4,"So i've been extremely depressed over the past couple months and lately it's gotten to it's worst point of being suicidal like every day, pretty bad. But i've been exhibiting a lot of behaviors of mania lately as well and am transitioning from my really bad depression into hypomania or full on mania based on my symptoms which all seem to align with mania. So I don't know really what i'm supposed to do about it, i'm just taking my meds as I normally do, i'm starting to experience less suicidality and more mania stuffs, I guess even having the realization that i'm entering mania is good but i'm not sure how i'm gonna go about coping with the symptoms."

On a positive note...,6,mg2ceu,2,"So I was just reading some comments in a thread that typically triggers me to want to engage in conversation to share my viewpoints. I realized that I was not triggered this time in fact I was bored by the conversation. It reminded me of so many of my other obsessions that I used to obsess about and prioritize in my life whether they were toxic or not and how they would affect me but then when I was no longer obsessed anymore it had no power over me. I have realized that I get obsessed about a lot of things but only for a short time. I think about these people that continue to be obsessed about certain things especially if it’s toxic for years and years and their whole lives. I only experience it for maybe a few days or weeks and then maybe the next thing I’m obsessed about is some thing positive. I never know what I will be obsessed about next. But at least I can focus on the positivity that I’m not stuck in some of these negative perceptions, toxic mindsets, and conversations that I once was. I can just hope that with continued therapy and medication and healthy boundaries that my obsessions will continue to be healthier and better in the future. I never make promises though because you just never know. As I’ve read someone say on here before, “It’s a wild ride.”"

Does anyone else find their migraine or headaches flow along with their mood?,7,mg25br,5,"I'm wondering if people can correlate or even predict which ones come first. I am not diagnosed with bipolar, but I am still suspecting it because i have recurring depression and/or dysthymia.

I typically have 2 migraine days a week, despite being on high doses of migraine meds (betablockers). I notice that the last dose increases haven't helped or even worsened it, because I get more tired and that can trigger a migraine.

However the opposite had also happened, now that I am easing off again  Since last week I'm doing great (after 2 weeks of turmoil) and I have been sleeping less hours (5-6) per night. I didnt have a migraine ever since, where normally you could calibrate clocks with my migraine patterns (eg day of week, time of day etc)

I have had these upswing before for about a week, maybe 2. Then it returns back to normal migraine schedule. So I really suspect they are interconnected.."
My step sister is having some sort of an episode - how to help?,3,mg1tcf,8,"\*\*Not sure if I chose the right flair, I'm sorry!\*\*  


My step sister, Laura (not her real name) is currently having some sort of ""episode"". It started last Wednesday. She started making Facebook and Tik Tok videos playing strange music and doing all sorts of weird, what I can only describe as, hand dancing movements. She looks exhausted and her make up is ALL over the place. She's been talking about how she is a contractor for the government and that they even sent her money for all the work she's doing for them (it was her stimulus check). She said she is doing ""mind control"" for them. Her bio mom, with whom she lives, had a therapist over to the house on Saturday. They confirmed that she was off her meds and said there was nothing they could do since she hasn't threatened harm to herself or anyone else. Laura also mentioned that the therapist was also a government employee, she could tell by her ""hand movements"". I don't know if this qualifies as her just dissociating or having delusions or if she's in the midst of a psychotic episode. Either way, does anyone have advice on what we can do to help her?  


Just for context, I am bipolar as well (2). I have random delusions but they are fleeting and I've never had any sort of psychosis that I am aware of. I don't feel like I can give my usual mental health help suggestions as I have never been in this situation. Our family feels at a loss right now."

I've been noticing a pattern lately that I have a better day where I'm still symptomatic but able to get some life stuff done. Then the next day I can hardly manage to do anything. It's literally every other day... I always cycle maybe times a day (sometimes by the hour) but the general pattern of one coping day, one bad day is consistent.

How can I help my boyfriend?,2,mg16uj,4,"My boyfriend is bipolar type 1 and OCD and I was wondering if anyone who has a SO with bipolar what are things they would do to comfort him when upset or for those who are bipolar what could they do to help you when your feeling down. I hate seeing him being down on his bad days / angry with himself/ upset in general and I just want to make him feel loved and happy cause he’s the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me. I thought bipolar just meant moody but now I’m understanding more about going from mania to depressive episodes which is what he struggles going back and forth from. I just want him to be open and come to me when he’s having bad days. He’s super happy and full of personality majority of the time but he’ll snap to being in a down mood and I just worry about him and love him, I’ll literally get nightmares about seeing his arm when he used to cut himself I just care about him. I’m learning more about bipolar but I just always feel like I could be doing more to make him feel relaxed and safe with me."
"I'm done, just getting some shit out.",13,mg14vb,9,"I need to vent and I don't know who else to vent to. Everyone bailed on me today, and I'm just so fucking alone. I welcome advice, but I really just need to get this out of me because I can't keep holding all this in.

Since I was about 12 years old I had felt this something click on. I can't tell you what it is, but I remember the time that my brain clicked on and just never turned off. I can never stop thinking, and nothing in the world made me happy to be alive for more than about 7 seconds, everything was great until I realized the thing wouldn't fill the void.

I've been a loner my whole life, not by choice. I haven't had a consistent set of friends or a friend group that I could have as a support system, or even just friends. People just never were interested in being my friend. I don't know if I'm just annoying, or if I'm not as nice as I think, but I feel like I would do anything for just about anyone in the world and when it comes down to it, no one would do the same for me. I've always felt that I have not, and could not fit in.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 18 and then one of my therapists when I turned 23 said I wasn't bipolar, but she didn't believe it was a real thing. I eventually stopped seeing her because she was not doing any good for me, and I felt as if she was doing more bad than good. 

After a little while I had started having very severe mood swings due to stressors;  I could not force myself to distance from said stressors, and I started having full blown breakdowns. I started rapid cycling and could not handle the physical toll they were taking on me, so I went to a hospital where I was admitted to CPEP. They did not commit me to the hospital, however they did diagnose me bipolar II and referred me to an outpatient program. 

The outpatient program involved therapy and medication and the psychologist and psychiatrist worked as a team to assess my needs and prescribe and set goals to help me through this. From the beginning the psychologist was absolutely unprofessional: Doing things around his apartment, fiddling with his microwave, went grocery shopping while we were in a session, was doing other work in sessions, just to name a few things. About 3 months in stopped contacting me entirely, and I wound up looking elsewhere for a psychologist. about 3 months after no contact, he texted me asking if I was available to talk, however, after 3 months I did not want anything to do with this outpatient program. 

The psychiatrist that they gave me through the outpatient program was an RN and was absolutely wonderful to work with, however, I decided to stop taking medication when it stopped doing anything for me. She insisted that anti-psychotics were what I needed to be on, but according to my therapist, mood stabilizers are way better for bipolar II. I decided to stop taking medication all together because I have had so many failures with every medication in the book.

In January, my life was flipped upside down. My grandfather died, I had to move out of my apartment and move back into my parents, and I decided to give up on my dreams to become a professional musician. Prior to this year, playing the bass was the one thing that could calm me down over anything else, it was the only thing I was that good at, and it had become one of my obsessions. I decided that working for my father would be a better option. He is an electrician and owns the company, so one day I can take over the company and have a nice financially stable life.

My father does not believe that bipolar disorder is a real thing. He constantly tells me ""everything is going to be okay; you don't need to worry; it hurts me to see you like this; the next step is going to the hospital (he's not aware I went 9 months ago); stop being a pussy; buck up; be a man, you're 24 years old; etc."" He embarrassed me in front of my aunt and uncle and when I got upset with him he understood I was upset, and then as soon as I told him I was upset about that started yelling at me. He paid my way through college, bought me a car, and did a million other amazing things and as much as I love him for doing those things for me, he likes to throw all those thing into my face and makes me wish he never would have done anything for me. Now that I work for him we carpool as the commute is 40 miles over bridges (so gas and tolls), and he won't let me drive myself even if I were to pay my own gas and tolls.

I can't stop the thoughts racing through my head. I can't stop constantly thinking the world would be better off without me in it. I can't stop thinking about how inconsequential my life is. I can't stop thinking about how once I'm dead, I will have not made any difference and I will be forgotten within 3 years. There's never going to be something that I'll be recognized for, there's never something that I will do to make the world a better place. I haven't been able to get myself from laying in bed watching TV or playing video games besides to get myself to go to work, and the occasional errand with my mother. I wish I could just evaporate.

If you read all the way through, I really appreciate it. I'm just lost and I don't know what to do anymore."

Any Writers Out There ??,2,mg0h9h,6,"
Hey y'all, do we have any bipolar writers out there? Looking for ways to make some writing friends?

During the last school year I interned for a program where we facilitated creative writing workshops in Jails and Community Corrections, and it was definitely one of the most fun and impactful things I've ever done in my life. The writing and the conversations were so full of vulnerability and passion, it really helped me to be the person I am today. I really think it could help out other Bipolar folks as well.

So I started a weekly creative writing workshop for all who are interested! We meet weekly, Wednesday’s @6pm mountain time. It’s super chill and no pressure, we just check in on one another and do some writing prompts loosely based around a theme. So far it’s only a couple of us, but I’d love to see some new faces in there! 

Any one interested?"

I read too slow, having difficulty comprehending and remembering what I read, and I’m full of anxiety whenever I try to write. I was so excited about being in this program during my first year but now I don’t want anything to do with it. It feels like too much for me now. I haven’t been working in over two years (left my corporate job after a horrific depression) and I really just want to find a basic job that’s not too stressful to regain confidence and stability.

Too many ideas, too much mania, sexual overload, loud, etc. The only meds that ever worked I just got on two years ago (I'm 33).

I'm gonna let my doctor know too. But I'm scared if hell up the dose, last two medicines left me in a painful spiral of depression where it almost cost my relationships and grades.

Blacking out,2,mfumjw,4,"Hi I’m new here. I recently got diagnosed with bipolar after getting misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder for 4 years and am still in the beginning stages so I’m not even sure which type it is. I was put on lamictal a few months ago for a mood stabilizer and recently a SSRI but haven’t taken it yet because of insurance. I’m coming here for two things:

1) I’m scared to take a SSRI again because I’m the past it made me feel worse (before I knew it was bipolar) and I’m really fragile right now.

2) I keep getting extremely angry over something little (like my car radio not working the other day) and then crying about it. Once this happens my entire mood changes and I’m mean and just cry hysterically. It seems super severe because I get seriously suicidal and don’t even have a reason sometimes on what’s wrong. Fast forward to the next day, i don’t remember anything and it’s like I blacked out. My roommate is around when this all happens and she tells me what happened which is how I know what happens, but it seems so irrelevant the next day after it happens. This happens at least 4 times a week and it’s so overwhelming and I hate that my boyfriend and my roommate have to see it because I’m embarrassed and can’t explain what’s going on when it’s happening. My boyfriend and roommate said I don’t really make sense when I’m in that state and I’m not sure what to do because I go to college and have 2 jobs and am thinking of dropping out recently with how hard it’s been and how my grades have been negatively affected. 

Thank you in advance!!❤️"

What do I do?,3,mfti5y,5,"Hey, I’m 15 and have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder for nearly six months now, but have been going through it for longer than that. My diagnosis originally started out as Bipolar 2, but it was changed to Bipolar 1 when I hit a 10 day manic episode and landed in the hospital after I crashed. My therapist also tells me that my bipolar has psychotic features, and on top of that, I rapid-cycle at an insane speed. In February, I had a manic episode and 2 depressive episodes for example. I guess I’m only making this post because I’m in a really bad depressive episode that’s been going on for a week and is only getting worse, and none of my medications work. Does Bipolar get worse with age? I’ve never met anyone with Bipolar so I don’t have anyone to relate to. I’ve been fairly suicidal for a while now as well, which no one seems to know what to to with that in my area that I live in other than admit you to an impatient facility. So, what do I do? I’m sorry if I’m rambling or anything like that, I’m just stuck between a rock and a hard place, and mental illness has taken control over my life."

Home ownership with my bipolar partner?,1,mfse8h,12,"Just looking for some advice. I am with my partner who is bipolar and gets manic pretty often. Recently we moved in together (losing our seperate and very cheap rent controlled places) and now we’re thinking  of buying a place. 

I would love to get a home and be a part of the haves, instead of the have nots, but then would be tied to this person. On the other hand if I don’t buy a place and leave them, neither of us will probably ever have a chance to own property ever in BC Canada. And they will be left to find a very expensive rental themselves since they don’t do well with room mate situations (keeps thinking they are spies)

Neither one of us can stand our current place since it’s super loud so we are moving either way."

Do Benzos make anybody else extremely manic?,3,mfrr9t,2,"I’ve never had a huge problem with benzos but have had a prescription before for serious panic attacks. A few years back when I was taking it more often I was also manic A LOT. More recently I’ve old had to use one a few times in the last few years. I didn’t think there was a connection, just that I was manic and the benzos helped to calm my system and numb my brain. 
Anyways yesterday in the midst of a horrible panic attack where it felt like I was having a heart attack, my moms voice came into my head reminding me if I’m having so many panic attacks recently maybe I should start taking anxiety meds again... So through the hyperventilating I went through my box of old meds and found some klonopine. First few hours everything was good, felt sleepy and kinda numb but okay, mid afternoon rolls around  and it feels like it’s wearing off so I decided to take another (the bottle said take up to 3 times daily) and holy shit. Not only was I high as hell but I became EXTREMELY manic! Trying to get In my car to drive away (absolutely in no condition to drive) while my fiancé physically had to fight me to get the keys out of my hands. Started talking about death. For the first time even reached out to one of those suicidal support lines (at least that was a win for the moment)

How do I know if I’m manic?,3,mfpylv,4,"I’ve only been diagnosed bipolar a few months now. I can easily differ when I’m manic in hindsight. I’ve also had bouts of hypomania but I’m struggling to figure out what is normal and what is hypomanic. I was severely depressed with bouts of high mania for years and now I feel like I could be leveling out but I don’t know whats my normal vs what’s hypo. After switching meds I had a few days of sever mania. Then it’s subsided. I was nonstop, constantly talking, fidgeting, researching, impulsive behaviors, grand gestures to loved ones, overspending . It’s subsided for a few weeks now, I cant figure out if I’m hypo or at a normal level. I still have issues with impulsive spending. Still constantly trying to start new hobbies, irritable and irrational. How do you guys know when your not hypo? Any advice is appreciated!"
Mania isn’t positive for me,37,mfps7b,29,"I feel like i’m not alone in this and i’m misinterpreting when people say they love their manic episodes.

I can’t stop talking to my SO and shower them in insane gifts and attention but i realize it’s obsessive and get insecure."
alevel takers?,2,mfprds,1,"i think this is general

hello im 19 and ive been writing here a lot lately because i feel like i dont have a lot of people that i can cannot w mentally yaknow cause we're different

um i used to be a really good student, i was best student for my entire school (the award accounts for academics + cocurriculars), am active in leadership roles like student representatives, i get pretty good grades like straight As were supposedly my standard, and i debate and do academic decathlons - you get the gist, people viewed as pretty much perfect albeit a little emotional to those im close to

i've always struggled w depression and took relatively high doses but yea kind of backfired as my episodes grew to be anger influenced and violent (before my episodes were just yaknow sob sob but i never got angry at people) and last month i got diagnosed as bipolar.

i have a-levels yo in may,, i really want to do it. ive been slowly studying again but i must admit its daunting. im on a scholarship btw, i dont actually live in the uk im asian. (also why mental health help isnt as advanced but its pretty alright but very much a big taboo)

im scared like my brain cant live up to it yaknow. ive gotten several uni offers and im waiting on one (London School of Economics) to either accept or reject me though ofc i hope it is the former. so like whats left is for me to push on my grades for my exams and ofc, get used to the transition of depression to bipolar. also might be midly adhd. fun times, fun times 🤡

Or, like the years before and immediately following my own diagnosis... you never realize it at all, which is scarier.

Manic warning sign? Also maybe trigger for delusions/food aversion,2,mfo67l,8,"So I have “Bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features” 

For the past 3 weeks or so, I can’t remember, my sleep schedule has turned into staying up till 8 am and sleeping until 2pm or so and no matter what I do I cant fix it. Im still going to work and seeing friends/fam as normal And no reckless spending kinda.

But now recently im starting to stay awake past that and sleep after work 3-6 only then to stay up until 8 am again. 
I think i sleep 4-5 hours a night now so I’m usually up 20 or so hours every day. 

On top if that, now when I try to sleep now I feel weird? Like my body feels scared and sick and tingly and my heads fuzzy and I cant focus enough to sleep or relax and when I wake up my head feels heavy and not normal.  But I guess that could be because I’m so tired to begin with even if I don’t feel it

Ive had hypnagogic hallucinations before and have always had vivid not pleasant dreams but they’re a lot worse now. No hallucinations yet (I expect) but the head heaviness and confusion is what I used to get after a hypnagogic hallucination. 

I’ve also been struggling with the notion that someones following me and that all the food I prepare and eat is rotten or dangerous. Most times im able to rationalize it but sometimes it makes me feel physically sick and I have to spit out food or I can’t eat at all.

Im asking if it sounds like mania cuz I don’t feel emotionally manic. I don’t feel much of anything really to be honest and haven’t for a while but I don’t think I’m necessarily depressed? and I mean I’m not able to think correctly most days or its very fast but its like I’m having all the other physical/normal symptoms of mania or maybe psychosis? I just don’t feel good but Im not like feeling miserable if that makes sense? 

Could it be mixed? 
I just feel like I’m heading somewhere bad but I also don’t feel as nervous or worried as I think I should I’ve been very emotionally drained/turned off the past several months anyway. 

I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way before a manic episode or during cuz looking online always comes with outside looking in experiences and I’m feeling kinda alone in my bipolar at the moment."
Bipolar disorder caused my girlfriend to ghost me.

Out of nowhere one day she just blocked me on everything, presumably because she thought I wasn't actually interested in her, even though I've understood and tried so hard, and I even texted her friends and family and I've got nothing.

This feeling of goodness disturbed me.

So after my bath I told my brother (whom I live with) about my euphoric feeling, as he wanted me to tell him the instant I felt traces of mania again. He told me to go to sleep early and to take a Tamezapam if I can't fall asleep tonight...

I’ve noticed more eczema breakouts than usual as well. Neither of these medications are working for me anymore. The higher the dosage, the more it starts to affect me negatively, so I’m going to discuss with my doc about the possibility of weaning off of both.

I also am having anger issues. Even tho I'm a true believer in nonviolence to my core, I need to figure out a way to mitigate loved ones falling victim to my outbursts.

Atypical manic episodes - who else’s manic behaviour doesn’t really fit the stereotypical picture?,4,mfko9c,8,"My first “manic” episode was 2018. He’s some ways mine don’t fit the stereotype, despite be needing hospitalisation for it: 

1. I saved money before during and after.
2. I had no inappropriate sex (to be fair this might have happened while psychotic if I’d been living with people who’d take advantage) 
3. I remember feeling way more anxious scared an paranoid that I’d done something wrong or people were out to get me than I did euphoric 
4. I find mania physically painful and desperately want it to stop when I fell it coming on and during 
5. I recognise something is wrong long before family friends and mental health professionals 

Things that are atypical My depression episodes:

1. So far have been worse on medications
2. I sleep more not less (could be medication related) 
3. Unless I’m on antipsychotics i can usually get up and go to work un medicated an function more than people expect 
4. I eat more and gain weight (might be medication related)


Obviously there are other ways I do fit what is more typically considered to be bipolar behaviours and experiences just thought it would be interesting to see the ways we don’t fit what even mental health professionals expect of the bipolar mind."

I don’t hate being bipolar,6,mfjgnx,9,"Hey all, I wrote something about my feelings on being bipolar and I just really wanted to share it.


I don’t hate being bipolar. It’s part of who I am. I hate that people can tell my mood states when they know me well enough, they know when I’m not ‘normal’; I hate that people can view me as fragile or take pity in me as a result of my mood disorder. I hate how careful I have to be sometimes. I hate that my peers can pull an all nighter and be okay, when that can send me into a full blown episode. I hate how closely I have to monitor myself.

But I don’t hate being bipolar.

I have mood episodes. And that’s okay, it’s normal, for me, and needs to be normalized. I experience emotions and ups and downs, just like everyone else. I may be more sensitive to mood changes, and mine may be different, more severe, actual episodes rather than just moods, but that’s okay. I don’t need anyone to look at me differently, or feel obligated to advise me. I know what I need. I take my medications, I do my work early so I can avoid all nighters as much as possible, I monitor myself.

I don’t hate being bipolar. I sometimes wish I didn’t have to monitor myself so closely. I envy my peers who can do more than I without worrying about the long-term mental health repercussions. But being bipolar has shaped so much of my being. The many hypomanic hobbies I’ve picked up over the years, most of which I dropped, have led me to find where I thrive. My hypomanic decision to go to RISDs program is how I heard about Industrial Design. My deep depressive episodes that I wouldn’t wish on anyone have bestowed me with a deep sense of empathy. Being bipolar has been an integral part of my life and has shaped who I am.

I’m bipolar. And I’m okay with that."
I’m almost 30 and I’m just now realizing I might be bipolar. The fact that I don’t know how long I’ve been this way is so stressful.,2,mfitjh,8,"I don’t know what I’m trying to achieve with this post, but I’m honestly hoping anyone else can relate. 


My husband (very kindly and lovingly) told me that he thinks I need to talk to my doctor about my insane mood swings. He thinks I’m bipolar. He’s bipolar as well, so I trust his judgement and I know he put a lot of thought into telling me this. When I asked him how long I’ve been having these episodes, he said since we met. That was 5 years ago. HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN LIKE THIS?! 😭 I don’t have anyone I could ask and actually receive a thoughtful answer from. 


And now I’m digging deep into my soul and tying to recall my earliest memories of mania or depression and it’s painful af. My anxiety has masked so many red flags. I’m pretty sure I’m going into a manic episode because of how much this is bothering me. I’ve never had a reason for my shitty brain until now, and now I feel like I don’t even know who I am or what im really like. I sincerely hate this. 


Was learning about your bipolar disorder also incredibly painful? Or is this a “just me” issue? I emailed my psychiatrist but haven’t heard back yet because of the weekend. I assume he’ll tell me it’s just my anxiety because everything is always “just my anxiety”"
"My boyfriend feels like he’s “suffering” with me as I suffer from panic attacks, PTSD, mania.",8,mfisai,4,"21F. TW suicidal ideation

My long distanced boyfriend and I have been best friends since high school. We were always very affectionate and supportive of each other. He’s been there for me since I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Since high school, he’s picked me up at all hours of the night, stayed on the phone with me, held me.... now 8 years and much more trauma later he’s still around. Last year we fell in love after a series of breaks in our friendship. When COVID hit, I was only a year into my bipolar 2 diagnosis and had to move last minute. I became manic during the entire transition almost missing my flight. I called him one morning after I had tried to unalive myself crying that I was still living, to which he responded “that’s stupid” I got really upset at him and we fought, he ended up blocking me on everything and we didn’t speak for months. Fast forward months of tears and longing for him I realized that I was missing something much more than a friend. (I thought this could be because he was my soulmate, but maybe what I was feeling was an emotional crutch.) We eventually made up after a few emails (he forgot to block me on Snapchat) and our Romantic\sexual relationship began again...

I longed for him so much that I went to visit him, but when I was there he was very... horny. No doubt happy I was there and all the lovey dovey stuff, but he def wanted to fuck. One night we got drunk and he started to slip his hands In my pants and coming onto me sexually. I kept saying now moving away and hey persisted. It wasn’t until I pushed him off did hem get the message... That was a whole thing, I felt used and he felt shocked and guilty at my response questioning, “ Did I just sexually assault you?” Needless to say, this threw me on a long road of mania, as I am rape survivor. I was so confused. I mean he did stop, he didn’t penetrate me, the lines were fuzzy, but regardless we were both left in shambles after this. 

I was angry at times, I called him a predator once, although I don’t think he meant to hurt me. No matter how angry we got though we couldn’t let the other go. I’m beginning to think this is a shame bond... He swears he is in love with me and he does treat me well, but it’s been about nine months since and I’m having mania, rage and anxiety attacks weekly. This has worn him so thin to the point where he says he’s suffering and can’t accept that I just expect him to deal with it. I really just expect him to be supportive, but I understand he has boundaries and that he is emotionally triggered by my episodes.Sometimes I ask for help and I am met with anger and resentment for all the stress I put him through. He also deals with anxiety and depression and I support him mutually, but he says we aren’t the same because I’m bipolar and my mania can be extreme... I feel this is ableist?

I’m not sure what to do at this point... I love him, he’s supposed to come visit me for my birthday (the tickets are bought), but the dependency I have on him isn’t healthy and it’s killing this relationship. I’m used to calling him when I wake up since the time difference fits for him being off work then, but I know I spend way too much energy on him. It’s to the point where I’m on the phone with him most of the day and I feel like an alien when I’m alone. It’s very hard to focus on anything let alone myself. 

I can’t help but feel angry and blaming him for this stage of mania, as I was doing better before the incident between us. I don’t like the way he talks to me when he’s frustrated, and he has repeatedly told me how hard it is to love me. I cry every day and the suicidal thoughts come often and I feel so broken and alone when I can’t reach out to anybody. Right now we’re on this break, but what can I do to give my self and him emotional safety and healthy independence? Is it even worth it after all this pain? Not sure how to get to the root of this compulsive feeling that I need him to stay sane. I know it’s a lot to unpack, but what do you think?"
I'm a muslim and I'm doubting the existence of God since I got diagnosed with bipolar,6,mfirog,14,"I have been depressed since 2015. I always convinced myself to have faith. The better will come eventually. That was before. Now I have completely lost faith after I got diagnosed with bipolar type ll last year. It's getting harder to believe in anything. My parents keep asking me to worship everyday, to pray, to read Quran. But I feel so distant from it. Even if I did it I feel empty. This does not mean I'm an atheist. I am not sure if God even exists.

The reason why I post this here is because I'm confused if this is related to my illness or? I need guidance on this topic. I am scared to confront my therapist about this since he's also a Muslim. I only told this to my friend, who is also a Muslim and she said this is because of my illness. I hate to blame it on my illness. 

Please note that talking about this publicly is considered taboo here in my country. I don't know who to reach out for."

"I don't think he gets it, I hate my bipolar.",19,mfi8mf,10,"I'm [34 F] was officially diagnosed almost 2 years ago, we are still working on getting my meds to balance me out. Since then I have literally lost everything; my career, custody of my only child, I had to leave a place I loved to move back to my home state in the Midwest and this all has caused so much stress on myself and my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years. I have days where I can't get out of bed and I sleep through the day,  this makes my boyfriend turn into a jerk, he shames me for doing nothing, he does get it. He can be very unsympathetic about my emotional needs, i tell him that sometimes when I get severely depressed just holding me or giving me a hug will make a huge difference. Usually that doesn't happen. When I'm not having an episode things are so good. I really think he is the love of my life/soul mate but when I'm manic or having a severe low I feel very alone, like he's not there for me. Is that normal?

Do you have moments you consider cringy but other people dont?,4,mfhg1r,3,"I had a manic episode seven years ago. When i have these episodes im more attracted to women. I consider every women a goddess.  I dont have issues talking to women.

I was at my friends wedding.  Her friend went to the bridal suite, i just had to talk to her. But at this this time i didnt know she just came out of a bad relationship.  So she wasnt emotionally ready.

 I go in the bridal suite and i start talking, i start saying things to her that should be written in some romance novel, a few minutes later, i start holding her hands talking to her in the eyes, something was about to happen, but then the door knocked, i got blocked you can say. It was something out of a movie moment.

In a normal situation this would be something people would be proud of doing. But honestly,i find this cringy because i wasnt in ""full"" control because of mania.

My friends brings up this moment once in awhile.  If someone mentions her wedding party, she brings up my moment also.

Does anyone else have a weird unhealthy attachment to someone?,13,mfgwbx,13,"There’s this girl that I met last summer who I have this strange attachment to. She’s a pretty shit friend in general and not someone I should keep inviting into my life. However, I’m just oddly fucking obsessive over the friendship. I post stuff on social media in hopes she sees it and responds. I go out of my way to message her over dumb stuff just to initiate a conversation. I’ve never acted this way before and if anyone else treated me the way she does, I’d end it real quick. It makes no sense to me because I have a hard time connecting with everybody else in my life. I just wondered if anyone else ever felt this way and how I can just get over it and stop hurting myself."
Lamictal questions,6,mfgn6b,8,"Basically, I have been on 50mg of Lamictal since September of 2020. I know, very low dosage. I think it has worked wonders for me and have been religious about taking it on schedule. However, I was out of town for 3 nights last weekend and got a little off schedule. I typically take my meds before bed but ended up taking them in the morning when I was out of town. I did not feel particularly out of whack at first, but after a week of taking my meds at a different time, I am starting to fear that I am trending towards mania (nothing severe but enough to be slightly concerned). I think it would be in my best interest to get back on my regular schedule, so my question is, how should I go about doing so? I know I have already disrupted my med schedule enough and would rather not fuck it up any more if possible."
Didn't sleep for two weeks. Is it bipolar or can it be anxiety?,8,mfgdfp,10,"I've been diagnosed for a year. 

I went to the emergency in the psych aisle due to being absolutely unable to sleep for two entire weeks. I was terrified and convinced I was dying and had to prevent my death. I found old prescriptions to get blood drawn in order to justify going to the hospital, very early, twice during the two weeks. The nurses kept asking me if I was ok, if I had eaten - I also didn't eat for the duration of the two weeks, I was unable to eat. At the hospital while getting my blood drawn, my bf was with me and I was hiding in the bathrooms not to leave, I felt I was safe in the hospital if anything was to happen to me. It was hell. Absolute hell. 

I decided to work out a lot to exhaust myself and make sure I'd sleep, but it didn't make me sleep at all. I came in to see a therapist urgently (I was not diagnosed back then) and I have no idea why he didn't click I'm bipolar. I was diagnosed years later. Eventually, life went back to normal gradually and I just started to sleep again like nothing happened. I cannot remember if this was followed by depression or not. 

Anyways, when I bring up this event to my psychiatrist, she says it can be anxiety? Not an actual episode of mania or hypomania. Since I didn't sleep AT ALL for two weeks, I have a hard time believing that was anxiety. I just want to know cause I often doubt my diagnosis, although I definitely am bipolar, I'm bothered this thing in my life is still blurred in a way. 

Can anxiety be the cause of this? Thank you!"

By breakdown I just mean like an anxiety attack just crying a lot, shaking, couldn’t look at my phone and my vision was blurry I just had to put my head in my pillows for like an hour and a half to calm down."
Does anyone else have problems with paranoia,22,mff4s0,20,I talked to my psychiatrist about my problems with paranoia and she said it’s possible it’s due to my bipolar. It can get very frustrating at times sometimes I can’t sleep cause im scared someone’s watching me. I’m also into true crime so Ik that’s most likely a cause as well. I’m terrified of the dark due to it too. Does this seem familiar to anyone ?
Left with horrible depression?,11,mff26l,8,"So I have been diagnosed with bipolar at 12 . I am finally seeing a good doctor, have not had a manic episode for a few months now,but I am left with this horrible depression. It lasts for weeks. Asked my doctor to be put on antidepressants he said no way because it could cause a manic episode. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this deep dark depression. Any of you deal with this? Am I ment to suffer like this the rest of my life? Should I ask my dr for something else for depression? Any advice would be appreciated."
I finally found a good way to manage my manic spending,9,mfeoh2,5,"Recently, I’ve come to a realization that there’s a (relatively easy) way I can manage my manic spending. Whenever I decide on some crazy new hobby/thing I *have* to have when I’m manic, I try to always order from amazon.
Their return policy is amazing and free, and you can return anything (opened/used/without packaging/etc) within like 60 days. Realizing this has saved me so much money when I realize I’m never actually going to get into embroidery but I somehow bought all of the supplies because I can just return everything in one trip to a UPS store with free return shipping and see a refund usually that day. When that doesn’t scratch the itch and I can’t wait for prime shipping, I started going to the dollar tree. They have little jars/yarn/soaps and things that fill the void in the meantime.

TLDR: try manic shopping on Amazon, you can return anything (even if it’s used) for up to 60ish days even if it’s not in good condition. If you can’t wait for prime shopping, go to the dollar tree while you wait."

my bpso keeps changing his mind?,1,mfeafx,3,"my boyfriend \[23\] keeps changing his mind about really big things in our relationship. after dating for 8 months, we broke up because he said he was overwhelmed and needed to sit down and find himself and figure out what was going on with his mental health. This was pre-diagnosis. we were broken up for a little over a month where we had 0 contact. he found out in that time that he has bipolar 1 and was medicated for it. We reconnected soon after his diagnosis and have been inseparable since. It's been almost a year now and we decided that moving in together was our best course of action. We took a few road trips to decide where we would like to move and finally decided on a city right outside of dallas, tx. We started looking at apartments and found a place to tour. we found a date to make the drive and things seemed to be moving forward.

a few days after making those plans, i noticed that he started to get incredibly distant. he wasn't as affectionate and wasn't talking much. after a week of this, i finally asked what was wrong and he told me, once again, that he wasn't sure about the relationship (even though he's been reassuring me that he IS sure for months) and that he was thinking of ending things. we decided not to make any impulsive decisions, and the next day we talked more. i brought up tabling the conversation about moving in together if it overwhelmed him and he said if we did that, it felt better than breaking up. 

i'm incredibly confused because for the past few months that we've been together again, he has reassured me, even when i don't ask for it, that he wants to be with me and that because he has been diagnosed and medicated that these things won't happen again. but yet... here i am. i'm now sitting here wondering if the love of my life is going to break up with me in a few months if we decide not to live together after our current leases are up.

i suppose i'm wondering if it's harder for people with bipolar disorder to stick to decisions that they seem so sure about. he was the one to even bring up moving in together. i'm just so hurt and confused because i don't want to lose him again, but i also feel like i can't handle the constant wishy-washyness of it all.

I’ve got a bad liver and a broken shelve
See dad I ain’t gonna die from a filthy shoe

Hoping she’ll come back one night with a gift

Sometimes you need to be a mess to get through it,22,mfcd1h,3,"**Contains triggering material regarding trauma.**

The before day I had the abortion, my ex named “A” picked me up and we went to the grocery store. He had decided he’d like to make me a huge pot of cuban soup, so we went shopping. As I stood idly by he snapped that I go find something to do and not just stand there. With another stab in my heart, I dutifully went off to go act like I was busy. He didn’t like me just standing there next to him. Though I wasn’t just standing there of course. I was laden with sadness. Hyperaware of the present moment in time I believe I will always remember. The hours and days post-pregnancy realization- the two weeks it took to get to here. Now. At the grocery store shopping for food, I’d presumably eat following the procedure. The procedure which would remove the little life I had inside me. Which had made me eat nearly nothing for the last two months. I had been very sick and tired. The two weeks leading up to this point in my story had been the deepest cavern of grief I have ever entered in my life. And now as I am exhausted, nauseous, with a splitting headache, puffy eyes and a red face, I go off to busy myself over some carrots.

I had not expected the news I was pregnant which came two weeks after I had broken up with A. To compound the grief, I had simultaneously lost what I thought could be the love of my life. The perfect man seemed to slide through my fingers the same week I found out I was pregnant from my ex. Except that man had a girlfriend he forgot to mention during the days he swept me off my feet. I guess I turned out to not be good enough to leave her for. I was furious at him for leading me on and having me be the ‘other woman’. I felt terrible for her. And I hated him for it. For being that man.

I never wanted A to be there for the procedure. Not after how he received the news. He came over to my apartment screaming at me demanding I go get the procedure then and there. There was nothing to discuss, he’d yell. What was I thinking? What a foolish woman. I just got a new bike- don’t I want to ride it? I don’t really want a baby, he said. What, something that will cry and demand all my attention? Didn’t I want to keep drinking and having fun with him? No? He left crying he’d never speak to me again, I’d be alone, I have no friends and no family who cares. I’d be alone and wouldn’t see a penny from him. Maybe he’d talk to me after I gave birth but don’t count on it. He slammed the door.

A few days later he came back. I had hoped he wanted to talk. I had found many resources to help and it didn’t really seem impossible. We didn’t have to have everything figured out just yet. We had, after all, discussed having a baby together a few times before. Maybe he needed a few days to cool off. I think he had thought of every horrible thing he could say to me on his way to my apartment that day. The gut-wrenching tears I cried and continue to cry are less for me than the baby. The baby I still had inside me I felt I had to protect from him. At that moment it felt like ‘us’ against ‘him’. And then I cried for the death of the family that could have been.

Rather than come to discuss the present civilly, every very word he said was like a knife in my heart. Every justification, rationalization, projection, unconscious fear, rejection, everything, felt like a dagger. And I had the man of beauty in my memory to compare him to. The two couldn’t have been more diametrically opposed. A was a wild lion; loud, callous, parasitic, rambunctious, charismatic, rude, artistic and unpredictable. M was a man of class. Balanced, logical, successful, spiritual, educated, empathic. But they had one thing in common; they were liars.

After the procedure, I spiraled down into two of the worst months I have had in my life. In one week I lost three things that in and of themselves would have been devastating. The baby, the man of my dreams, and the abusive fallout with A- which compounded the rejection from M. Everything A said to me about being worthless, crazy, foolish, naive, sick, friendless, family-less echoed in my ears. A couple of times I considered checking myself into a hospital for suicidal thoughts which began to resemble a concrete plan. It’d be easy. I’d sell everything I owned, buy a gun, travel in South America, and when the money was gone just end it. End my pathetic, useless, mess of a life. With a bang. I was in a critical state. I boarded myself up in the house, only cooking and eating the soup A made me, talking to myself in full conversations, sobbing, then feeling full of energy and ready to tackle a painting, drinking and smoking heavily. I’d take modafinil to have a ‘productive’ day, then would drink and smoke my vape pen until I was barely able to walk to bed. I woke up each morning thinking ‘ugh another day’. And the memories would come. And I would curl up in a ball and sob. I couldn’t, and still can’t, listen to music with lyrics. I want it all to get out of my head. Anywhere I am I get furious at what's playing. One major delusion of mine is 'messages in the music'. I take these things as signs. Given my mental state I can't stand any happy music of love and life, nor do I want someone else's sorrows and bullshit on my mind. Music is a great passion of mine and it has been, for the first time, banished. All I can swallow is classical and ambient. Dancing and singing and vibrancy is dead to me. Where it was once what healed me through all these years.

Every time I see a beautiful woman or hear beautiful music I think of M’s girlfriend. She must be amazing; beautiful, successful, independently wealthy, a great dancer and spiritual to have him. Maybe that woman looks like her. And I stand there and cry.

Ten years ago I was diagnosed with depression with psychotic features. But when given an SSRI, a full-blown manic episode was triggered. It was great for my painting but left my life in shambles. I was re-diagnosed as having Bipolar I. I resisted treatment and medication for eight years therafter, so from what I understand I am much worse off for it. Much of the delusions I struggle with are paranoia-based. This has been the worst episode I have had except for the time I was hospitalized. The last time I was hospitalized back in 2010, I totally lost my shit after having had a devastating experience with the first of three great loves in my life.

I think the most frightening thing is not being able to distinguish reality from what is. In the moment I am so perfectly, seamlessly, naturally sure of what is happening. Only in retrospect do I see how inappropriate, deluded, misguided and plain wrong I was. Which circles us back to the futility of life those with Bipolar feel. When only in retrospect we see the truth. The realization and acceptance of this raw honesty is understanding the persistence of this curse. That it is my fate to never get it right.  I can never trust what I am thinking. Because at any moment I may be completely mad.

Through all of this M has shown up as an angel. Encouraging me, gently gently gently to stop drinking. Encouraging the painting. Encouraging meditation. And I have felt nothing short of fury at him. It comes in waves. Day after day I am pounded. The grief and anger. Forgiveness and love come, for a time. Then I am furious again. I try and try to forgive and put the past behind, and be a friend. Recognize what kind of person he is deciding to show up as- now. To forgive what happened and start anew with the kind of friend he is trying to be in my life. And I can't do it. I have not been this furious at someone for such a prolonged time in my life. Usually, sadness always wins out. In this case, the anger has. And it turns me so sad to see myself self-destruct and continue to be angry and push someone out who is wholly trying to be present in the most neutral and supportive way. I see what I am doing. And I am grieved that I can't forgive him. I don't know how much of this has to do with my illness, or how much is simply justified on a human scale. My friends and family (yes I have them) would say I stand supported in feeling how I do. But to me there is always something wrong if anger and grief are held so strongly. I think we always need to find what needs to be healed, and do what we can do for each other to heal it. That's what love is. We all fuck up. But love is committing to healing and moving forward.

Anyways the whole point of this long rant is my realization today that sometimes you just need to be a fucking mess to get through it. M encouraged me to stop drinking and meditate and be all-around more healthy, which I am no doubt sure would be great for my overall well-being- but even the suggestion of that made me angry. Why? Because I hadn't gotten the mess out. Two months ago I was at the bottom of the ladder. No one could pull me up. Not even my own stubborn self looking at the light. No, I needed to be here as long as I needed before I decided it was going to change. It's so easy to want big things overnight. I felt that way this whole time- I needed to make big changes and then xyz will happen. I realized today that there's not a damn thing wrong with my needing to have a few beers and write and paint and think myself into and through where I am now. Tomorrow will be different. A week will- a month even more yet. But right now, I am here. And that is fucking ok.

Weird mania recognition moment.,22,mfc9rf,8,"Have you ever had the exciting feeling of unrecognized mania ripped away by recognizing your mania in the strangest thing. Drinking, hyper sexuality, grandiose nonsense, new guitar... they all got passed by my mania radar. But I just listened to Candy by Mandy Moore on repeat for an hour and I had a *fucking* blast. It came on my running playlist (after Opeth and *insert cool band*...) and I continued to listen when I got home. Then I realized, “oh this is definitely mania and it has been here for a minute.”

Now I wish I recognized earlier. It is absolute horse shit that Mandy Moore’s “Candy” was the thing that pulled me out of a manic stupor and not the shameful shit. What the hell are the meds and therapy for? I feel like such a failure. I had so many chances to just stop and think about if my behavior was okay, but it took getting weirdly into a song to finally get me to reflect. I don’t like what that says about my values. I also feel kinda confused which is unpleasant. This shit sucks, y’all. Writing this helped though."
The death,6,mfbr27,7,"What happens after we die? This is the great question that kills me from inside. I'm alive physically but I'm dead mentally trying to make sense of it. We're alive on this so called earth, that is a spinney planet. Its messed up, how do we know that big bang made the universe? Like the whole reality (simulation) our perception aka a dream came out of nothingness. I don't even know and we don't know what's real, is me typing just a simulation a dream? It's all so messed up. I don't even care much about things now, I take precautions sure. But I just feel like I can float through life, its so hard to explain. We're all here for a reason, at least I think so. I believe that there must be a higher goal than just reproduction. Like what's having 8 children going to help you with regarding the existence. Maybe you were meant to fulfil this since you were made out of cells in the mothers womb. The great things we see or at least look for in ""rich people"" Are fame and money, but why. Do we need that to have nicer things than others? Just to show off, there must be a purpose and it all messes with my head"
Lamictal Latuda and Trazodone,2,mfbp5i,3,"Hey guys, I suffer from BP2 but majorly suffer from depression and low moods.

Starting to wonder if it has to do with that and considering tapering off. Also wanted to add I was on trazodone back in the fall shortly and remember being in a better headspace, and was taken off of it for idk. Does anyone find trazodone effective for the depression and/or sleep anxiety? I wake up everyday a mess because I dream of stuff that makes me anxious.

I get false memories and have delusions that people are following me, I imagine that old friends and my family are plotting against me. How am I supposed to tell the difference anymore? Half of what I think isn't real. I just wish I could meet myself as I am without the bipolar. Maybe that way I wouldn't feel like such a lost cause."

It is constantly beating me down and makes me feel worthless. As a result I live a solitary life because it gets out of control around people?

It never ends and I'm wondering if it is racing thoughts and part of bipolar, so I'll be eating something 'you look crazy when your eating, you look like a wild animal, oh look your hands are shaking you freak, no wonder you cant stand to eat infront of people, you have no friends to eat with anyway, better keep eating to stay alive you pathetic joke' this is what running through my head when I'm eating.

I'll read spiritual things to try and get out of this ' nothing can save you from the disaster you are and always will be, try your best to get out of it, but it will never work, your never going to escape the fact your less than everyone and the most humiliating person  everytime you open your mouth you humiliate yourself '

I wasn't designed to live life like everyone around me. I am destined for great things, but on my own terms. This hyper-fixation on self-control is causing me more pain than this disease ever could. If I could give any piece of advice to anyone around me it would definitely be ""stop resisting"": stop trying to be normal, and start trying to be healthy and true to yourself.

I don’t have overly typical presentations of mania or depression either so most mood trackers aren’t really geared up for me.

I’m constantly tapping my feet, wringing my hands, biting my nails and skin around them, etc but it’s not like I’m doing any sort of obnoxious behavior.  I’m severely depressed and don’t really have to motivation to act on my feelings of needing to do things.

St. John’s wort as an alternative to ssris,1,mf7rhy,4,"I hate SSRIs. I really despise them. I hate the agitation, the pacing, how dumb they make me feel.

But, I’ve been on a down swing for the past 4 or so months and that’s dysfunctional in itself. 

I’ve been on taking at John’s wort for the past two days and although it’s not great. I don’t feel as “possessed” as I do on SSRIs.

Considering I’m on mood stabilizers, does St. John’s wort have any more risk than regular ssris? Or would it be about the same? Is there anything else I should know?

Edit: idk if you’d call this mixed episodes. But a big part of my bipolar is feeling slow, drowsy and dumb, but also agitated and up at the same time?

My relationship with God,1,mf7ncg,6,"I had my religious awakening during the summer. In the church I sat in the back, the priest spoke to me. I was shown a number and when that number appeared something was supposed to happen. Ended with my friend crying and a stranger paying a taxi for us home.

//

In the city in the church in the room to the right there is a book you can write in. Write something to god or to the church. If you go back to fall it says “Don’t tell me to punch people”. I went back to see if I had actually written in it when I was there with a friend and he didn’t believe I wrote it.

//

I had broken up with god. I was invested in other things. The clock had stopped at 18:52 and I wanted to know why. I ended up in the city I grew up in. Even went to church to mock him and tell him there was nothing there that scared me anymore and in return he mocked me. The time was 18:52. When the church bells started ringing all I hear was laughing and I was so angry he was telling the entire city he had tricked me again. Everyone was looking at me, as if I was causing a scene.

//

In the schoolyard we were looking for someone. He kept shouting “stop” and no matter where we went he kept teleporting. I first heard him when I saw the hare and I always see them it should be a red flag by now. Me and my friend gave up. He turned off the flashlight and we continued our walk. We passed a small church and I heard something in the graveyard. My friend said “I’m not going in there”. I told him to just listen. “Do you hear the church bells?” I asked and he said “I don’t want to be here”.

//

I’m waiting for someone by the statue every day after work. He will show up eventually and he will show me what to do. He treats his bipolar disorder using religion. He never showed up.

//

I’m in his living room and he turns on a movie about vampires. It’s disgusting. We are drinking red wine but I have barely touched mine and he keeps doing shots. He asks me if I’m cold and wants him to close the window but he doesn’t know I’m listening to the man outside repeating “The blood. In the glass.”. He closes the window and it gets very quiet. I ask him if he’s religious and I feel like I’m looking right through him. He says yes but he wants to know why I ask.

I’m in the kitchen and I’m looking for a knife. He’s freaking out calling my friend. I do not want to do this but I want to know what would happen if I did. I’m getting irritated because I’m trying to explain to him the reason and he doesn’t understand.

I’m in the bathroom and the door is locked. He opens it with a pocket knife. I say your scissor is no good it barely penetrates the skin. He’s showing me his self harm scars. I say nonono you don’t get it I just need the blood and there’s no blood.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It keeps coming back, I keep going back to religion. It terrifies me afterwards and I scare people away. This people can't relate to so they don't understand and I can't explain because I don't understand either."
"No sleep without meds, how does lack of sleep affect you?",5,mf776x,3,"My body is running on those like a fast paced train in hyper speed. ***Can't switch my brain off*** without my meds

Latuda withdrawal and worsening depersonalization?,4,mf6i2n,2,"So I was on Latuda for 2.5 years, my doctor decided to wean me off because I was having really bad depersonalization and realized it had started when I was initially put on the Latuda.

My problem is now, that I’ve been 3 weeks completely off, my depersonalization is REALLY bad. Is this a case of “things will get worse before they get better”?"
Impossible to rely on others,2,mf66ns,3,"I have like zero capacity for relying on other people to do what I need them to do. I feel like with work, home projects, etc. that I am constantly double and triple checking to make sure people are on task and then when they slip up or forget I have a personal meltdown. If someone was double and triple checking me I totally would not forget. I hate how casual normies can be sometimes.

Probably why I have no friends."

What does a mixed episode feel like?,3,mf483e,10,I suffer with schizoaffective disorder and I’m wondering what I’m feeling right now is a mixed episode. I feel like I’m crawling inside my skin and I want to constantly shake my body because I feel so uncomfortable. Also couldn’t sleep all last night either and felt like I could run a marathon.  At the same time though I feel depressed and I’m feeling lots of guilt and stuff too. Is this a mixed episode?
Vraylar made me bonkers.,1,mf45we,4,"Anyone out there actually go psychotic on an antipsychotic?! Just started taking Vraylar and last night I woke up about 10 times and this morning I had this strong urge to kill myself. I kept saying ""You are not your thoughts"". It freaked me out. I do have bits of psychosis mixed in with my depression but nothing like this. I'm thinking of just doing depakote monotherapy as I've basically taken every AAP with zero success. Has anyone had this happen?"
Nausea and anxiety in the workplace,3,mf440u,2,"I feel suicidal because I cannot perform most tasks that most people can do at a job that pays minimum wage at a coffee place. When I cant put food in a bag, make drinks, or other things because of my anxiety I feel stupid. Im still trying to get comfortable taking orders and I was told yesterday that its time that I learn how to make drinks and that stressed me out. I dont know how to reply to others questions knowing that I feel like garbage, I havent ate and I'm nauseous. I dont move as fast as the others.

Ive been here for one month. Im always asking for help for lots of things. It just feels like Im going nowhere just because of how uncomfortable and insecure I am in my own skin. The job makes me suicidal. The people there are fine, its just the job. Ive been very nauseous everyday here because of how much the job stresses me out. Medds and therapy have been ineffective or harmful. I work four hour shifts and those shifts take about everything in me to finish. and I havent ate much since working but I like the idea of financial security, being payed at a higher hourly rate than everyone else, free food and drinks everyday, and a sense of belonging. I felt like such a loser playing video-games everyday while everyone else worked while I was unemployed for 8 months after being laid off due to covid. I dont feel connected to my body."
DAE...Social media shame?,3,mf3xh0,3,"So COVID/Quarantine really knocked me right on my ass. For a few different reasons (insurance, job loss, not being able to see a doc, then just laziness and mental illness) I stopped taking all my medication last July. I was like taking it every other day or every two days starting in June to stretch out my dose (lol, who can relate!!) 

I had convinced myself I had PTSD, or nothing at all, that I wasn’t bipolar. I was wrong!!! The one positive is that...once again, now I really know lol.

I ended up immediately spiraling. Oh my god—I behaved so poorly online. I was in a mixed state for months, heavy on the depression. I didn’t post cringe content EVERY day but when I did post things it was like diary style, “Here’s a look at my life,” YIKES. One time I aired a grievance with someone publicly. Posted ridiculous, unhinged tweets. I wake up a night and shame spiral. It haunts me. I worry so much about how other must perceive me now. 

I had to delete everything. I have never done that before—normally I enjoy social media, now it makes me paranoid. I just started medication again. I feel like I made such an ass of myself. My friends who know I am bipolar would never think I’d make a judgment call like that, going off my medication. 

Anyway, anyone else? How have you moved on?"
"Mild psychotic symptoms, does it get worse?",5,mf3ja8,7,"During mania and mixed episodes I have experienced a whole range of mild psychotic symptoms.

-everyone around me has the same face
-I thought my friends were controlling me through a playlist
-I convinced myself my room was infected with rats and I couldn't touch the floor.

These are just a few examples. 

All of these have lasted hours, or max 2 days.
Some have happened while medicated, but most have happened before.

I can live with symptoms like these, but I am really scared that one day it will take over.

Those of you that experience full psychosis, did it start like this?

Or are there others that experience mild psychotic symptoms like these and live relatively well with them?"
I desperately need advice on meds.,1,mf32nt,3,"I’m on Latuda 20mg, Sertraline 25mg, Gabapentin 300mg twice daily, Trazodone 50mg 1-2 a night. 

I was doing really well at first but now I’ve gone off the rails and am having a ton of dark and anxious thoughts, crying, not doing well at all. I was only taking Trazodone occasionally before, and then when I started taking it every night things seemed to go bad. I will have health insurance for the first time in a couple of years starting April 1st, and I have a telehealth appointment with a mental health nurse practitioner to get some better help. 

I am currently prescribed these meds through a free clinic in a red state. The clinic is not open on weekends and my assigned therapist is not responding to me, I assume because she has weekends off as well.  

Any and all advice is very much appreciated. I’m struggling."

I'll even pace as I think about how I need to stop pacing or stop myself from walking into a particular room because I know someone's going to say something about my 5th or 6th entrance. Does anyone else have trouble with repetitively restless motions like this?"
I Am Sick And Tired . . .,4,mf214z,11,"Of people pretending to be the brave ones publicly flaunting their mental illnesses when it’s just a ploy to get attention and special treatment. 

The other day a lady at work ignored safety and production protocols resulting in an entire shifts work being scrapped. This cost the company a minimum of $150,000. After being “reprimanded” she laughed telling me that she just had to play the bipolar card and they let her off with a written warning!

She’s done this in the past to get away with excessively calling in. Not using fmla days or hr approved medical leave. Just calling in. She’s used it on the production floor to get out of doing jobs she doesn’t want to do, she uses it to have long breaks, and she uses it to get other employees to do her work. 

And I’ve seen others do this too!

I understand using fmla or hr approved leave. Those are ok. I understand that you may not always be at your peak, but you can’t just use mental health to excuse being a crappy employee. 

I’ve had other employees whisper to me about her special treatment. It’s not helping anyone by playing into the mental health stigmas. 

I don’t share my being bipolar unless I have to. I know that that’s my choice. I keep my stuff together for 8 hrs a day. Others should too. I don’t think that’s too much to ask. 

Thanx for letting me get that off my chest. 

Smash that dislike button.

TL;DR - A lady at work intentionally uses her mental illness to get away with being a crappy employee. I’m not happy with her."

But when it comes to suicidal thoughts I have no idea how to tell anybody what I’m going through. I’m so scared of being locked up I guess if I tell someone. I don’t have a plan or anything but it’s definitely something I think about. Probably too often. Last night and today have been really hard. Between other physical health diagnoses basically telling me I’ll be in pain for the rest of my life, and then just completely losing control and flipping out on my fiancé last night with no empathy... he was just trying to communicate and be vulnerable and my bipolar got the best of me.... I just feel horrible, broken, and I just hurt the people who love me. I don’t know how long I can keep going with the physical and mental pain. I know I need to tell someone... but how do I do that without automatically being put in inpatient?"
I’m tired of suppressing my emotions,2,mez1v5,7,"Ever since I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I always feel like all my emotions are not valid anymore.

I don’t want to argue with people anymore since I know how bad I treated them before (which was influenced by the disorder too). I don’t know anymore. I hate it."

Craving madness / intrusive thoughts,4,meyfd8,4,"Hey,

Sorry if this isn’t allowed or if it’s triggering. I’m in a bit of a strange place at the moment & this is the safest space I know to be open.

I’m diagnosed Bipolar and on 100mg Quetiapine soon to be increased tomorrow to 125.

For the last 4 days My mood on Daylio had been tracked as “Up” - my one step before hypomania so I’m trying to keep tabs on myself. I’m still new to this whole disorder and I’m still learning about where bipolar ends and I begin.

Basically, I’ve been having incredibly intrusive thoughts about wanting to get high. Weed, cocaine, alcohol and even crack.

I’ve never had any issues with alcohol or substance misuse per say. I used to smoke weed 4/7 days a week up until 6 years ago when I turned my life around. I used to use cocaine recreationally (couple times a year) sometimes lacing a spliff with it. Last used this substance in 2017 when having an episode.

I’ve never been a massive drinker. I drink on occasions (birthdays / Xmas) etc and maybe once or twice a year. This is through my own choice and not based on dependency etc.

For the last 2 days or so I’ve been craving getting high. Wanting to feel stoned, or elated through coke. I’ve even fantasied about crack! I know! It’s absurd! 

Is this a sign my mood is going to spurt into hypo or am just a fuck up? Is this a symptom of my disorder do you think or am I just sabotaging myself.

I’ve got an appointment with my doc tomorrow to discuss the increase of my meds to 125 and I’m scared to bring this up for fear of, well I don’t know what. 

Sorry for the massive essay!"

And don’t get me wrong, my AMAZING psychiatrist is there. And I had a wonderful therapist there, but she recently moved away and opened her own counseling business, and it’s too far of a drive for me. 

Anyways, here’s to (hopefully) getting back into therapy!! It’s been about a year, and man I really miss having someone to talk to who actually gets it."

my fortune cookie spittin straight facts tonight 🥠,344,mewhln,21,
I need advice,2,mew8ym,2,I have bipolar disorder. It has been pretty consistent where Ill have longer manic episodes and shorter periods of depression. But recently in the last year it seems like it's doing the opposite. I feel so drained and overwhelmed especially this past week and it's getting harder to be content and not get super angry or start crying when ever I get frustrated. I do not want to talk to my parents about anything that's going on or about going to therapy because they always minimize and invalidate my emotions especially when I bring up the fact that I was supposed to get officially diagnosed by a specialist almost two years ago because my therapist I had seen for a few years at that point said he thinks I definitely have bipolar disorder but he can't diagnose me. Its frustrating because I'll have time periods where I'm completely fine and then every few months something will trigger it and I'll start going into a manic or depressive state. I know I am entering a depressive state and I would really appreciate any advice in how to slow it or make it not as bad.

I feel like the effect of the 600 mg of Lamictal is really not reduced at all by the birth control like it should be. I typically fall asleep around 3 am and then wake up after 4 pm.

Yeah, that didn't happen. Here is a list of mine. It would be worse without my wife's intervention. 

- Carpentry. Took one class. Bought tons of tools. Family bought me some. Never did anything with it. 

- Gardening. Vegetables and the like. 

- Miniature model painting. Kinda still in it. 

- Warhammer 40k. This was my second manic go around with it. Spent too much money. Wife was pissed about this one. 

- Playing the violin. I was convinced I could learn and master it in a few months. 

- Joining the military. I practiced for the ASVAB (sp) and told my boss I was going to join and they would need to find a replacement soon. I never joined. 

- Masters Degree. I enrolled without a lot of thought on this. I made it through one class before the depression hit and the mania ended. 

- Writing a book. Started an outline. Bought a chrome book just for this purpose. I knew it was going to be a best seller. I understood sci-fi like no one else. Never got past 2 pages. 

- Frisbee golf. Bought the discs, read up, played once. Was ready to buy everything because I would be the best. Wife stopped me. 

- Drawing with colored pencils. I am now working on this. Spent money on everything I can. I swear, this one will work and I'll be great. So far, I've drawn ONE pictures. It literally, and figuratively, doesn't look good.

*Edit. 

- Sewing. I have a machine in a box that will never use."

I hit a seriously depressive and suicidal low again, culminating in a trip to A&E on Tuesday that was horrific, the treatment I received was disgusting and I'm not going into details because I can't process it right now. The Community mental health team came out to see me on Thursday to check on me, it's normally one lovely person but their manager ""randomly"" came with them this time, turns out the psych team contacted them to say I was violent in A&E which is a complete lie and I'm struggling to get my head around it. 


BUT, on Friday I started to just feel average, steady, normal if that's a word we can use! I've felt mania bubbling away under the surface but I think (I don't know about you but it's hard to fucking judge) that I've just had a really nice two days without being manic. I've slept 4 hours since Monday and don't feel tired so I'm obviously not 100% but I've not done anything destructive or out of control. And I've just had 2 days where I think I've felt how people that aren't mentally ill feel every day. 

I've enjoyed my own company, got some cleaning and washing done, but not at 10million miles an hour and on repeat, I've been for a blood test which made me leave the house alone! Score! And I had an electrician here for a few hours, I hid upstairs but I don't think he noticed how uneasy I was.

"Lamictal dose reduced, horrible side effects",1,mekof3,13,"My dose of lamotrigine (Lamictal) was reduced from 200 to 100 about a week ago and I’ve been spending all day feeling horribly dizzy and nauseas, disoriented, hot and cold, etc. When I try to google the side effects of reducing dose I only find symptoms of cold turkey withdrawal. I want to know if what I’m experiencing is normal cause at this point I’m getting scared that I have cancer or Covid or something. I’ve been having feelings of dread that I’m going to die and I want it to stop. Thank you!"
So tired of being tired,6,meklo7,6,"I've read some posts that say they have to nap every two days. Not me, every day I have to take a 2-4 hour nap or suffer through the worst form of tiredness where I feel like a zombie for 3 hours. What a waste of time if I due take a nap and what torture I have to go through if I decide to fight it. The dosage must be too high right? There is no way this is how everybody with bipolar feels. No way I could hold down a job in this state. I am in school right now so I can take naps around my schedule."
"Bipolar 1, insomnia, and somniphobia",5,mekh3k,5,"About two or three weeks ago, my family and friends were noticing my early manic symptoms. I got unusually addicted to my social life where I would go out of my way to socialize and meet new people despite the demanding work schedule I had. I started going for late night walks and sleeping less to socialize or exercise. I didn't miss the sleep and told myself I was doing great and feeling great. I guess I didn't need the sleep was what I told myself. I started feeling invincible. 

Eventually, after my father and friends began expressing greater concern, I caved and went to see my psychiatrist. My antipsychotic dose was increased. As a result, I calmed down and popped back to baseline. Then, this week, I began swinging out to the depressive end. 

The fact is that I still cannot sleep. I'm averaging at around 3-4 hours a night and where as before I simply thought I had better things to do than sleep, now I straight up fear sleep in the same way I fear death. I'm exhausted, but the idea of sleeping terrifies me to the point of where I now would rather deprive myself of sleep entirely than even attempt a few hours. 

I've gone from energized and peppy to exhausted and miserable. Worse still, I feel confused and keep dissociating which makes walking places a new level of adventure since I can't remember how I got somewhere. My relationships are suffering because of my irritability, paranoia, and straight up bizarre behaviour. The doctor suspects I may be delusional.

I don't think I'm psychotic. It would be rather peculiar considering my recent antipsychotic dose increase. I do feel tired, I just feel so afraid of sleep that I refuse to. I can't figure out why."
"Currently in the ER for a medical issue and trying not to be triggered by my surroundings. Of course, I have to disclose my Bipolar I diagnosis and meds and there is such a fear and low grade paranoia of being dismissed, stigmatized, or at worst, thought to be symptomatic and sent to a psych ward.",8,mejqop,13,"Had an appointment with my PCP this morning to do some cardiac testing and she said I had to go to an emergency room immediately. I've had many traumatic experiences in hospitals and offered to make an outpatient appointment ASAP instead. She wasn't having it so now I'm in an ER bed.

Most of the staff has been OK so far but it just sucks how disorienting hospitals are in general (for everyone, not just people with mental health issues), and how staff do not make any effort to orient you on their own. I think I'm waiting for someone to take blood but who knows bc I wasn't explicitly told. My bed doesn't have a pillow, they didn't bother plugging in any of the monitors (my heart rate was super high in triage so you think they'd want to plug in the pulse monitor??), and I have to pee but IDK if they will need urine for testing later so I'm stuck holding it in. Imagine being legit manic and irritable in this setting--I would've gone off by now. 

Keep me company guys?? :("

re-diagnosed as bipolar 1 by dr.,1,meiyyy,8,"SO I was rediagnosed by a new doctor i probably saw like 4 times over the diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder I had from a psychiatrist who new me for 6 years... I am really starting to think this new dr. should have just stuck with the schizoaffective diagnoses... I started hallucinating absent of any mood episodes yesterday... its allways been like this. I can be completly fine for months and months and months but then have 1 weird day where its like depersonalization at night for a couple of nights that goes away when I go to sleep (is gone when i wake up), then I have audio hallucinations for 1 day. I only hallicinated yesterday like maybe 4 different scentences through out the day and now I am better again with just catching up on sleep.

&#x200B;

Just kind of aggrivated that dr. seem to like changing diagnoses so much instead of going by what the previous dr. who knew me for 6 years had diagnoses me with.

Feel like the deffinatly should have stayed with the schizoaffective disorder diagnoses."
Hyperbolic Nightmares,35,meixy6,3,
Bipolar after severe head injury,1,meiu1j,5,"Ten years ago I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder at the age of 17. That winter, in a drunken stupor, I jumped out of a hot tub that was surrounded with ice and cracked my head open and wasn’t taken to the ER due to all of us being intoxicated. I don’t remember the following two days and eventually was admitted to a psychiatric care facility. I was treated for substance abuse and depression. About six months later I had my first manic episode.

It hasn’t until recently I have been questioning g if that brain injury could have either caused the Bipolar disorder, or if it was just a coincidence. Any thoughts or similar experiences?"
Memory’s of being bipolar as a child,9,meimky,7,"The more I read I become more convinced that I was bipolar as a child. I have always had this troubling memory of waking up terrified in the middle of the night around 3 or 4 years old, having the pusical of something touching or clinging to my back. At the time I describe it feeling like there was a lizard on my back. As and adult I’ve always said that it felt more like a hand. I was often severely paranoid after that and soon had the first depressive episode that I can remember. I just laid on the carpet and wanted to sink into it and die. As my childhood progressed, so did the bipolar, showing up as serious mood instability. Crying, being angry, or depressed unpredictability. 

Can anyone tell me about early onset Bipolar?"
Relishing a good day,2,meielt,1,"Having an upbeat Saturday after a scary night of rapid cycling on Thursday is awesome 😁🙌

I went down to my favorite bar to do some paperwork at the end of a very productive day on Thursday night and went totally manic, I was very engaging and talking a mile a minute. The owners son thanked me for the great conversation. If only he knew, haha. 

As soon as I left my self esteem puddled on the ground and was incredibly depressed on my drive home. By the time I got back to the house I was rapid cycling like crazy, wanting to die one minute and thinking of suicide and then being quite positive the next. When I was up my scalp had this tingling sensation, is that a thing? 

I eventually did something positive myself, finally took my meds, got in bed, felt better, and fell asleep in front of one of my favorite movies. 

I woke up feeling pretty good yesterday, was very productive, and kept myself out of the ditch last night despite staying up too late again. 

Today I feel great and do not feel manic at all. I love this feeling. I’m not used to feeling this way and hope that this will be the new normal. 

I’m new to this. I’m 35 and was only diagnosed this past October after a lifetime of relative instability. I’m ADHD, have generalized anxiety, and PTSD too. 

All this to say that I’m celebrating a good day of stability 😄

Send good vibes, info, and perspective please."

Late onset,20,mehrka,7,"I was diagnosed at 45 after a (to me) horrific episode of mania, including delusions and I think audio hallucinations. I was earning six figures at the time, but I didn’t like my job, and my marriage was falling apart. I went to the ER one night and had an overnight in the ER two nights later. I knew I needed to check in three days later when I couldn’t bring myself to ask my brother (who was visiting from out of town because he knew something was up) to protect me from the assassins who I was convinced were after me. I think I made up gunshots. I was convinced the only way I could safely get to the hospital was via ambulance, thinking the metal sides would protect me from gunshots. 

I’ve gotten back to work, but it took a couple of years to build up the confidence. The biggest difficulty has been losing friendships. I think I pushed some people away, but I did some embarrassing things during my mania, and I’m sure some of them just turned away, not knowing what to do.

In the end, I’m convinced my case is “mild.” I can work at a pretty high level. I have ups and downs, periods of “would be” hypomania and the lowlight film of things I’m ashamed of from childhood in. But it’s the loss of friendships that is so difficult. Not easy to make friends at 50.

Anyone on a very low dose for their prescribed meds?,7,mefghm,5,"I was diagnosed with bipolar over two years ago, and I was prescribed a heavy dose of meds in the hospital that made me practically non-function. I get why they did that. I had not slept for days during a manic episode.

Fast forward and I have been off meds for 2 years. My post-hospital psych said I’m her easy patient. She lowered all my meds to practically nothing. Then eventually took me off everything.

I’ve had a hard time with the pandemic and have had some minor episodes over the past year. All of them had to do with alcohol (self medicating). I’m working hard to quit drinking and I think it’s a major culprit.

I saw a psych and they immediately want to put me on the heavy doses I was on in the hospital. I don’t want to do it. I won’t.

I’m highly functional with my disorder, and I say that as modestly as I can. 

But I want to be on something minimal.. for starters at least.

Question: how to support someone in a manic episode,2,meeuhn,5,"I hope this is okay and I want to start off with the fact that I have sooooo much respect for everyone who experiences mania. I have had what have been diagnosed/assessed as hypomanic episodes and they have been really uncomfortable. What my family member is experiencing right now looks like a much more intense version of that. 

Anyway I made a [post in r/asktherapists ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askatherapist/comments/meeoe8/a_family_member_is_having_her_first_full_on_manic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) but I thought it might be helpful to ask folks who’ve personally experienced this what they wish their support system had done and what things their support systems have actually done that were helpful. 

She’s an amazing person I have so much respect and love for. I just want to do anything and everything possible to support her right now.

Again, I’m sorry if this is inappropriate but I read the rules and I think this is okay...

Taking lithium for other than bipolar and how does it affect the memory?,1,medif1,6,"Hi!

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, ADD, pain diagnosis. My psychiatrist is not sure yet wether I’ve ADD or cyclothymia, because both is so close to each other.

I tried Lamictal a couple of years ago with pretty good effect but I developed a dangerous rash in the ninth week. My psychiatrist thinks that I could benefit from a lower dose of lithium. 

My fear is that I’ll feel even more dull as I am after many crashes of stress/burnout, and I’m also worried how lithium will affect the memory. I’ve been sucidal almost daily since 3 years ago, after I crashed going off meds

What are your experiences?

Also could lithium help with physical tensions/pain?"

Oy vey. Tattoo issue.,9,mecmkr,13,"So. I am planning on getting a tattoo today at 1:30PM CDT. All’s good, right?

WRONG. 

The one person I confide in, my husband, was not informed. I forgot to tell him that I was actually executing on my idea. I’ve been ruminating on this for months now, and finally am pulling the trigger, yet I didn’t tell him. It was also to make sure that it wasn’t an impulsive bipolar thing.

He was understandably upset. The only reason he found out was because I left a copy of the paperwork in the front seat of my car, and I don’t have tinted windows. He would have otherwise found out when he got home and saw my tattooed arm. 

I don’t know how I could have royally fucked up so badly. I comforted him the best way I knew how, and he asked me if I had any other secrets. I don’t. I love the guy, and had no idea why I didn’t just tell him that I was getting a tattoo. 

Has anyone else done a dumb thing like this with their SOs?"
"So , hallucination in my words. Feels like trauma stuff or trauma of psychosis experience",2,measxl,3,"If you’ve advice i’d appreciate it. I will explain details in fiction just to be clear. 

Lets say i am frightened of the middle finger gesture. Like subtly i think people may give signs (paranoid) occasionally. So my trusted friend talks. I notice quickly her hand movement and at the end gives me the middle finger. This frightens me. I ask her later for reality check to see if she did. She didnt of course, i knew it but i needed her confirmation to close my thoughts on the matter. So.. i call that a hallucination bc i saw it and it wasnt true/real. Came from head. Confused but clear now. Maybe just trauma from initial psychosis that had middle finger in it. 

Dift story- Also, i felt a bodily reaction which ive felt before when delusional but i was ok in my mind. I think it was panic attack. My psychologist mentioned the symptoms of weak in knees, moving slow, about to collapse on ground. Body shock. A wave came through my body somehow. Anyway i was reading into things , maybe mildly episodic , but keeping my mind clear when i could, it felt more than my mind. trigger was seeing a belt, thought of dad threatening to hit me with it. Thats real. I felt shock and collapsey feeling now. Now, this could be trauma when kid OR more likely trauma of the delusional time when i first thought of the belt and had a reaction to it years ago. (A trauma pf psychosis details OR trauma of real events.)

I try to say fuck it to all details and just get through the process of weirdness. I am getting better at managing this though i trip out on things i hallucinated in past including voices and audio and middle finger stuff. And paranoia etc. doc says anxiety can cause psychosis. 

Real or unreal is unsettling when i dont know at times. When i am healthyish and functional. Anyway reality checks really help and im lucky to have people i can open up to. 

Any thoughts appreciated on anything :)"
Sleeping pills?,1,mealr8,6,"I'm at a perfect point in my treatment where all but one symptom is gone. I still get very bad insomnia and I've tried Lunesta just to end up 24 hours with no sleep.

How is xanax supposed to make you feel?,1,meak7m,6,"I've been experiencing hypomania and bad anxiety recently.  It's making it hard to sleep and focus, etc.  Anyhow, I started 1mg xanax xr today and didn't notice that much of a change.  I did get work done that I needed to do (I haven't been able to focus recently) and managed to moderate a group discussion well for my class (interpreting and processing information and then speaking/writing about it has been hard as well).  I think it was easier to get stuff done too.  But I did hyperventilate and cry today and felt anxious toward the end of the day.  The only side effect was I was slightly uncoordinated in work (physical job).

TL;DR The day was good but I was anxious again tonight.  Im just not sure if it's working or if it's takes longer than a day or what.  What is it supposed to do?"
Annoying whilst hypomanic,3,meak2q,2,Does anyone else ever get told that they’re annoying when hypomanic 😅
Cant stop ruminating,5,mea41f,5,"24F diagnosed with Bipolar II. I’ve been in a really bad spiraling depressive episode, the worst of my life after not having access to healthcare for almost a year due to losing my job during covid.

I’ve recently had some interpersonal relationship issues that were pretty intense happen that triggered and worsened my episode. Since these are the only problems in my life that I feel I have some semblance of control over I can’t stop thinking about them.

I think about the issues for hours every day along with now audibly crying every day for hours as well.  I keep trying to analyze everything and psychoanalyze everyone to try and find a reason why things happened and why it might be my fault and therefore something I can fix and how I can fix it.  I try to distract myself but always come back to it.

The best ways I’ve found of coping are sleeping and not being alone, so I’ve been sleeping all day til 5 pm and trying to plan things with people  when I have energy or spend the rest of my time with my dad.  I’m also obsessively co-ruminating  so I keep trying to talk about my issues and figure them out with others at no actual benefit to myself.  Even if I try to ignore my thoughts I end up getting exhausted from my friends rather early as I keep circling back to the thoughts. Any hobbies I have are completely uninteresting to the point where I force myself to pick something up and stop almost immediately. When people tell me to let things go I then start obsessively thinking about why I can’t let things go.

Anybody else ever experience rumination this debilitating before? This isn’t something I’ve really covered with my therapist or psych as I never really realized how bad it was until now.  Is this level of rumination common with bipolar?  

I appreciate any responses!"

Aspergers v bipolar mania,1,me8kla,2,So ya'll know how people with aspergers have their super intense interests/skills that they could run on and on for hours about. Well mine is certain legal topics. I am in the middle of case management involving a legal case that is specific to my interest/skill set. I was going on and on about it to my p doc and he tried to mention mania. i tried to tell him that I was stressed due to upcoming hearings and also I loved my work anyways so I rarely get to talk about it with other people. There were no other signs of mania minus talking fast about this case. My sleep was relatively intact (minus some stress) and no other risky decisions were being made. Silly p doc.
Friendship Troubles,1,me8efr,1,"So I've got a long term friendship group and unfortunately for decades on of my friends has been a bit see saw in his support for me.

In one hand during my first manic psychosis he drove my wife to a hospital many miles away at 3am as the staff couldn't get me to take a med, I was completely paranoid and only seeing my wife with the med and being able to trust her was I able to take the med and finally sleep putting myself and hospital staff out of danger.

I'm grateful to him for that, dont get me wrong.

That was 7 years ago. I manage my mania very well and I am more depressed now than high, and I have PTSD, Anhedonia and BP1 and an attachment disorder.

None of these conditions are my fault, but I have had issues with addiction for a long time but with counselling and accountability I am now clean.

This friend can also take great pleasure in being verbally cruel to me, especially on nights out when he is drunk and I am sober and low, as it takes me a lot of mental energy to stop myself drinking.

On many occasions he has been very cruel and I did not bite until one occasion in my mid 20s when I was drunk and he started and I blew up badly and threatened him with his family watching.

My fault, I apologised for it even though he had his part to play, and for many years he would make snide comments and I would have to take it, because he knew that I felt terrible guilt about what had occurred even though he was equally to blame. 

Until last year. A night out with the friendship group and conversation turns to how people change, and I stupidly said that I had changed for the better, which being 48yrs old and having gone through some very painful events that lead me to addiction, I had gone through the pain of counselling, forgiving my dad for being a violent bully and had stopped using substances.

I have changed for the better.

Then my friend said, with a big shit eating grin, that I still wore my victim mask, don't you? 

I swallowed the bile even though he was clearly enjoying the moment, grin spread on his face. I didn't deny the truth of what he said, he was right. 

I have a Bipolar brain. Trauma or not the result is the same. Mania or depression, and for me its more severe depression. 

I kept my counsel even though I felt the rage bloom inside my gut.

I said that he didn't understand my diagnosis, and I offered him the opportunity to listen to a world renound expert on the subject which he would find helpful.

He just laughed and shook his head.

I lost it at this point, and things almost got physical outside and we definitely butted heads.

In the end I walked away and my other friends told him that he was out of order.

Eventually I went back to them and then had to catch a train home - with him.

I told him I was sick of him viewing me as someone broken, as it requires huge personal strength to fight this condition and he clearly doesn't understand my journey or diagnosis. 

As we got off our train his wife was in her car and he offered me a lift home. I refused point blank, I think I honestly may have done something stupid and even though he was clearly shocked at my refusal of a lift,  I got a cab home, got drunk, and tried my best to fight the urge to end my life.

After this I became manic and wrote about my feelings on Facebook a few days later, couched in metaphor about many things, but which obviously didn't help, but I was manic and my dad was dying which was raising a lot of trauma for me and was extremely painful.

I'm not backing out of being accountable but I refuse to apologise first. This friend now refuses to speak to me and of course in doing so is tacitly attaching blame solely to me because of my diagnosis, which neatly gives him the perfect get out clause for him to avoid responsibility even though he very graphically shamed me in front of my peers.

My hatred for him is becoming a festering wound. I have had to forgive my own father for his bullying and violence but I haven't got the will to do this here, and its consuming me daily.

But he is living rent free in my head, and even though instinctively I know its better for me to forgive I feel unable to, even though its the best way to free myself from this prison. 

Any advice?"
Hives on Lamotrigine?,1,me7wu8,3,"Today I noticed that I had a patch of hives on both my knees and several bumps (mostly flesh or pale pink) colored on my elbow on and on my side. There is one red bump on the bottom of my chin. Some itch, some do not. I’ve been on 50 mg for about 8 days now. I’m high-key terrified, not because of SJS (tho that’s a concern) but because I have a phobia of bumps and holes in skin. 

I plan on calling the doctors in the morning, and I’ve put neosporin and a steroid cream on and taken a Benadryl. 

What else should I do, and how likely is it that I’ll need to pursue treatment in a hospital or is this something I can remedy at home?

Edit: so the hives still aren’t gone after using a steroid cream and Benadryl. They’ve actually tripled in size/space so I now have hives on both my arms, on my palms, on my knees, and on both of my sides. The ones on my knees itch but the ones on my right arm sting/burn. Both of my ears are also hard and swollen. I will be going to the Urgency Care in a few hours tho.

Edit 2: so Zyrtec and Benadryl and Benadryl cream helped and the hives went away. But then, as I was munching on a bag of trail mix with nuts, chocolate pieces, and cranberries, I realized that I bought it on Thursday. Right before my hives showed up (–_–). I’ve never had a nut allergy before but I’m so stupid lmao"

Sometimes its good, sometimes its bad, but it never makes sense. In the moment you never question it. Your sure that its real. Completely consumed and entranced. Subtly, yet fully delusional.

Experience with seroquel,1,me729n,6,"I’m really intrigued to learn more about the side effects of this drug and want to hear other peoples bad experiences with taking seroquel. Also does my story sound like your experience?  (TLDR at bottom). 

To start, I’m not bipolar, but I take this medication to counter prescribed stimulants so I can sleep. I’m 3 years in and find it really volatile in how I will feel the next day. 

To me, I find this drug is helpful but god damn It messes with me a lot. I’ve managed to get my dose down to around 6mg and still I can have days where I constantly feel emotionless the whole day. Compared to my good days where I actually feel happy and talkative. 

My second concern is, I learnt that it’s making me depressed and anxious, and a little insecure somehow. While I can get into states of feeling vulnerable. (This generally happens when I accidentally take more than usual, as I use a pill cutter to cut a 25mg tab into quarters) or when I’ve taken it later than 8:30-9pm 

For example when I’m not effected by it, things don’t trigger me, I’m emotionally strong enough to deal with anything and feel confident within myself.

On a flat day, I feel emotionally weak, not confident, and I lose my sense of self worth and my value, I cbf doing things with my friends cause I feel down in general or disinterested. 

I feel it effects my relationships or work because it’s quite clear I’m not my usual smiling talkative self. Plus it generally just sucks feeling like this when I clearly know how I am without this.

My doctor doesn’t really have any other safe options for me so Im more or less forced to deal with this and I’m so over it. 

If you could share your thoughts or any idea to help I’d appreciate it heaps.

Ps: I stopped taking my stimulants for a month, and stopped taking seroquel as well, all these problems disappeared so can confirm it’s the seroquel. 


TL:DR:  seroquel has a long lasting effect other than drowsiness and tiredness, it leaves me feeling vulnerable, it steals my confidence and my value as a person. It sucks, it’s volatile, it also puts thoughts in my head that aren’t usually there when I’m not feeling like a flat emotional pancake. I’m over it but don’t have any other options. Please share your experience or how to deal with this drug, or share other safe options. Cheers."
"People with a uterus, IUD question + meds",1,me6xeg,5,"I’ve finally found the right meds for me. Latuda, lithium, and Seroquel. It’s time for me to replace my hormonal Kyleena IUD. I was considering switching to copper to get rid of extra hormones. Has anyone made this switch? I’m worried because I’m feeling stable for once with a hormonal IUD. I’m wondering If I’d do better on a non hormonal one. (Thinking Copper IUD). Psych said it could go either way- I could do better with no hormones or I could completely tank. There’s no way to know. What would you do? Test the waters or keep the same one? Have got you had an experience or moment in your treatment similar to this?"
Lithium weight gain on normal diet?,1,me6m3c,5,"If someone has experience with this or insight or whatever please help lol. I would really appreciate it.

I started lithium almost two months ago. My blood level is currently not at a therapeutic dose (currently taking 900mg). Despite this, I've gained weight - around 10/15 pounds. I eat mostly plant-based food and drink water/tea/juice/coffee and energy drinks (from time to time). My calorie intake is healthy and appropriate for my age/height/etc. I have not had any lifestyle changes and have not noticed any change in appetite. I thought that lithium affected appetite which is what can cause weight gain so I'm really confused.

I spoke with my psychiatrist and he discussed some other alternatives such as seroquel, but warned that it could possibly cause weight gain as well."

But now my moods are swinging wildly from happily homicidal to depressed. I gave my bipolar disorder and the symptoms a name but they're starting to feel like a separate part of me...like I have 2 pilots or something.

Today I also noticed mario in my rear view mirror when driving so I'm guessing hallucinations might be starting?

I think my personal therapist is freaked out. I'm freaked out at the moment.

bad work life balance = sporadic meds for 2 months (rant/vent),1,me59q6,1,"i'm bad at life

i (f 25) moved out of my parents house 8 months ago to a city 2 hours away to work my first full-time job. i can't really be an adult. it took me forever to get a GP here, then they couldn't get me a timely appt with a new psych. they asked me to make an appt with my old psych to get my meds (why not just prescribe them in meantime???) 

anyway i don't know why but i was so scared to call and ask them to prescribe me my meds so i was basically ""rationing"" them by taking one every other day, taking the other days between, and so on. that's been going on a few weeks although this has been a cycle for months. i scrounge for old pills, cut some in half, take tiny doses of my old adderrall vs. the XR just so i don't get manic and can focus at work even a little bit.

then i decide to email my GP to ask for RX. they call me back and i was asleep. i called back and was sent to voicemail. then i sat on it for a week and now i have to wait til Monday and i have to go in apparently

and it's so hard to schedule things off. i'm tired all the time. my job is hard. i got my vaccine 2 days ago and got extreme suicidal urges. now i'm going through withdrawls off of my duloxotine, which has happened repeatedly over the last few months since i'm just tired"

Apparently  I’m not expected to do these things and this is a figment expectation I put on myself? Apparently I do this a lot according to SO.

Im wondering whether I can take a seasonal job with bipolar,1,me3wyn,7,"So I’ve been on different cocktails of meds for probably about 4 months now, maybe longer I have horrible memory, and nothing has really seemed to help me. Everything that I’ve tried has either not helped at all and made me worse or I have been better but not without intolerable side effects. 

Right now I’m on lamictal and I was also on vybrid which is an antidepressant that put me in probably the worst depressive episode I’ve ever been in, so obviously I got off that one. With all that being said, I’m hopelessly trying to find a combo that helps me and doesn’t make me hate myself and everything around me, but a medicine that doesn’t make me impulsive and crazy either. 

I just got offered a dream job working seasonally at glacier national park and that would be my first time away from home. I’m worried that I’m not going to be able to take the job because of my mental health issues and would just like some advice. This depressive episode that I’m in has really been making me self sabotage everything I do. I cant seem to have a single positive thought about anything. 

I’m worried though that if I stay home this summer, then I will be missing out on such an amazing opportunity and I will be so confused on where my career is going. I wanted to use this job as a way to see if I want to pursue a job in hospitality or maybe even a job as a park ranger. I’m scared though that leaving my comfort zone is going to be the wrong decision and I would have to come home right after I get up there. If anyone has advice for me that would be greatly appreciated."

and life is a just a constant battle over the control of the plane and we're probs gonna crash and burn and maybe that would even be better b/c i feel so **overpowered** sometimes and i even think of crashing the plane myself so i can reserve some sense of control over the situation.... or was i just hit over the head again by one of these two hijackers?

Diagnosed bipolar 2 recently but not sure If my psychiatrist knows what he’s doing.,4,me265w,7,"I was diagnosed bipolar 2 recently and my psychiatrist prescribed 2.5 mg of abilify. I was confused and asked, what about a mood stabilizer like lamictal? He claims that abilify acts as a mood stabilizer and prevents mania while helping depression. He tends to prescribe low doses and claims he doesn’t see many side effects. I literally can’t find any information that shows that low dose abilify can be used as a monotherapy. Everywhere I read says that it is for mania and/or for an add on to ssri/snri for depression. Also, hypomania is not frequent for me and not severe. Depression is my main issue. 

I am currently also on a low dose stimulant for adhd and cymbalta for depression/anxiety and ibs. If I’m bipolar 2 wouldn’t these meds cause mania?

Struggle [Art by @SharkySnapz on Twitter],2,mdsc71,1,"I've been waiting to get a piece done to accurately represent my feelings about growing and dealing with the actions from my Bipolar 1 Disorder, eventually a friend was kind enough to hear me out and give me this portrait.  Being diagnosed and treated in my 30's, the realization of my actions in my teens and beyond started to add up when I was finally medicated, and the reality hitting was the hardest to deal with.  It wasn't so much the unbalanced emotions, depression, or loss of interest...it was the impulses.

To buy what I didn't need but wanted at the time, which resulted in living paycheck to paycheck for that small thrill of something 'new'.  My manic nature to add onto my extroverted personalities, which more often than not, made me aloof to my surroundings to what was appropriate and what wasn't.  To act without thinking, despite knowing better, resulting in VERY risky sexual encounters, and eventually a DWI at the age of 20.  Foregoing others feelings and having that delusion that I was always right on a choice or topic, despite the facts being evident and clear.  Years of debt stacking higher and higher with no end in sights, and more.  Needless to say, I can be thankful I'm alive and healthy at 33 years of age currently, but its been nothing but a miracle which still surprises me to this day.  Taking medicine now, I can really see the effects of my choices from my spontaneous impulses.

If I were to really describe it, I would classify my impulses as my other-self; taking control for that temporary time doing XYZ, but then coming back down to reality and having to deal with the back-lash and fallout of those choices.  I don't want to seem like I'm giving all the bad choice in my life an excuse due to my mental health, it's just hard to rationalize what was me and what was my other-self's choices.  I've risked my health, inside and out.  I've hurt  others whom I could never truly express my deepest apologies and sorry for random actions.  Past lovers, friends, family, even strangers.

I can never truly get rid of my other-self, medicated or not.  However, the unfortunate experiences have made me wiser and more aware of what I'm capable of, how to steer away from repeating those actions, and even being more open to ask for help when even I can't handle the pressure.

Anybody consume significantly less caffeine when they’re manic?,3,mdrygp,7,"Hello all! 
I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder early last year and I’ve learned a lot about myself and the disorder since. As I try to find the right medications and doses for me, I’ve been monitoring my triggers and warning signs very carefully. Back when my depression was unipolar, I had a strict 2 cup coffee ritual every morning—and if I were ever running late, you’d find me at the nearest coffee shop without fail. But since the onset of my bipolar cycle, my caffeine consumption is a lot more sporadic. I’ve noticed in the early stages of a manic episode, my 2 cup ritual will become about a 1/4 of a cup at most and I won’t even miss it. I suppose caffeine is the last thing I’d need during a manic episode anyhow...just thought it was interesting. Anyone else experience this?"

Dissatisfied,6,mdroeo,3,"Just a little bit about where I'm at, was diagnosed just over 4 years ago with BP1 and put on lithium, I've been on all sorts of mood related meds for 14 years tho. I've been consistently on lithium for 4 years (some adjustments and other meds thrown in on occasion). For the first time in 14 years I have been on 0 meds for a couple of weeks (with my doctors advice, kidney issues, thyroid issues, memory etc etc).

So far so good, I mean its shit but it's the regular kind of shit for the most part. No surprises. I have just been feeling so dissatisfied, I constantly feel like there is something I should be doing or something I should have accomplished during the day but I can never figure out what. It's not like I'm in a low and just unable to do things, I am trying to do things and constantly seeing if anything will scratch that itch. But it doesn't. I am getting things done but there is never that satisfaction and feeling like ""okay, now I can chill"".

I can't even sleep, I mean I'm tired but I don't feel like I've completed the day and done what I need to, if only I could figure out what the fuck it is that I ""need"" to do. I just feel stuck and uncomfortable all the time. 

It feels like there is a gaping hole in my life but I just have no idea what the fuck is supposed to fit there.

I guess I can be thankful that I am stable and that this is the worst of my worries for now. I just really need this feeling to go away."
first angry manic episode - coping skills?,2,mdrl6u,10,"hi everyone 
gna keep it short 

i was diagnosed bipolar in 2019, was on quetiapine for a bit ( but it sent me to ER so i stopped ) and then i moved out of the country for a year, was recovering amazingly from my other issues as well. i had no manic phases through 2020. it was a huge achievement for me. 

had to return to my home country due to covid in october, been struggling ALOT to keep afloat as my trauma etc stems from environment 

i knew this was coming as i have been very very depressed and down for weeks and i just was expecting this mania to be happy but right now its angry i have never had angry mania and its stressing me out alot

right now i am very very angry and i have never been this angry in my life i am also starting to get a headache i also do not have any medication now but i have an appointment with a general practitioner on monday for a referral to a pyschologist so that will be sorted 

but right now i am very angry and i need to calm down and i do not know how to calm down because generally i am never angry and right now i am also eating ben and jerrys ice cream its kind of helping but not really

if u have any coping skills i would rly rly appreciate it, it could be grounding exercises or just simple things to do 
thank you"

Parents and lashing out,1,mdq6n6,1,"I feel like my family has never been normal and there’s always been something just off. The excessive fighting and screaming seemed normal to me until I dug deeper and realized that the only reason my parents married is because I was born. My mother might be a narcissist but I’ve been living with her telling me that she would have never married my dad if it wasn’t for me and that her life would be so much better. She also tells me she’s throwing away all my things when I go to college and turning my room into something else. All of that stuff is said to me every day but then I’ll get the occasional guilt trip from her which just features her trying to make me feel bad for lashing out when I really have never developed a real relationship with either of my parents. I feel so guilty for lashing out on my dad especially, he also has to put up with my moms constant manipulation and he has no one to talk to about it. He doesn’t know how to talk to me about anything deep and I completely lost it on him last night. I feel so guilty because he screamed at me afterwards talking about how much money he spent on me today and how I shouldn’t be rude. The thing is when it comes to money or an actual relationship I’d much rather have a father I could talk to. They both know about my struggles with mental health and found out about me SH two years ago, nothing ever changed and I was never taken to a therapist after constant requests. I feel bad for lashing out on them but sometimes I just sit there and my brain goes in overdrive and absolutely everything starts pissing me off and I can’t take it. I want to blame them for not getting me the help that I need but I know it’s my fault that I can’t Control my emotions when I’m manic. I don’t know if it’s right for me to feel guilty for this but I just feel like my family has never been my family and I think that’s mostly my fault. I’ve never felt at place at home so I Resort to avoiding my parents at all costs which usually isn’t hard as neither of them are ever home. Thinking that I’m graduating next year and my room is just going to be gone and I’ll be a guest at my own house just pisses me off."

Upon research via Google, it seems that this is an off label use as bipolar is supposedly suspected to include abnormal Ca signaling, however there really isn't very good studies on it.

Now onto my actual reasoning for this post. Does anyone feel like they’re just out of their body? I didn’t have it all of the time but lately it’s been happening all of the time. I don’t know how to describe it, really. I feel like I just went on a two week camping trip and got dropped into civilization without a bath/shower and have to live my life. I can take a shower and still feel so greasy and uncomfortable. I want to peel my skin off. I try to do the motions of “life” and work and sleep and hydrate and whatever and I just don’t feel like I’m part of it whatsoever.

A Place Called Normal,19,mdoz47,2,"Finally found it. The right psychiatrist. The right meds. Wake up at 3am with teeth clenched, wide awake, eyes open like dinner plates. I unclench my teeth, breathe in slow, exhale slower, repeat, then sit up in bed. The sleep is a minor inconvenience, as I peer out at this strange new world of near constant normalcy. There still exists a familiar aching in my chest... of scarred soul tissue from a lifetime of self loathing, and regret, and suicidal madness, but it is faint now, just barely there as a reminder to take my medicines. The rest, is almost normal. Work. Play. Eat. The loss of intensity in certain joys are an easy trade for the loss of intense stress, and anger, and pain. I walk through my day now, with relative ease, and when in doubt... I simply breathe."
A crackpot theory,5,mdos7f,1,"I've been crawling out of a depression, and found a model to keep moving. It's been helpful to view the sadness, emptiness, rage, bliss, happiness, what have you, as excitations in an all encompassing field (similar to gravity, electro-magnetism, and higgs fields); where yeah, you might be feeling _____, but that _____ really isn't yours properly: You barely own it as our brains kinda do their own thing in regards to what neurotransmitter soup you're being served at a given moment; it's not even that unique (look at the size of this community); and ____ feeling is transient and ephemeral over a long enough timeline.

My family blames with for everything so i come here , i try to post a something , i get a goddamn warning or whatever it is called for blah blah ? Sorry where else  can I talk ?

This community is meant to be there for people like us , we should have each others back . But nooo this place is a safe heavan for people getting praised . I dont need praise , i need to express myself . I know it means nothing to most of you , but believe me , there are still some people in here who cant and shouldnt think about what they need to say , they just need to express themselves. Shame on people who claim to be bipolar and restrict us from expressing ourselves. I blame us for it .there is no difference between us and people who call us crazy. And yeah one last thing. Bipolar is NOT defined by borders . It is something we all deal with regardless of our gender , nationality , religion  etc . As an Iranian Atheist who is already thinking of the best way to die  i am telling you , the things that many of you western people go through is not even comparable to ours.

"Now medicated, slowly walking away from the person I always was. Melancholy over my past crazy self.",8,mdniee,7,"I'm so glad to be stable. For once and for all. I would not go back, it was too painful. Way too painful. I was losing people around me, unable to hold a job, unpredictable and so alone in this world. But I had my own company. Having to figure out the world through my distorted lense, feeling like my blood was divinely boiling, able to move mountains and be the creative genius who was going to kill herself for her art, as cringy as it was at least I was delusionnal. My medication shut the lights off of on all of it. 

I was hurting. It was torture to live in my own skin. It's been a year since I started medication and the more time passes, the more I realize I've departed from her. I'm not her anymore. I might never experience life as her anymore. Of course, I miss her. I miss feeling like god, I miss seeing patterns everywhere, to be able to temporarily make sense of the universe, no matter how much of a lie I was telling myself without realizing it. If only I could be her again, only for an evening. Only for a minute, to be reminded what it is life to feel so fucking alive. To be reminded of the twisting pain in my chest, traveling down my arm, reaching the tip of my fingers. I almost miss drowning in my darkness, inside of my self, crying oceans, and begging the sky to save me from myself. God, I miss her. I hope she's well, I hope she's found her light."
Lamictal and sex drive?,2,mdmyom,5,"As most of us on here, my libido used to be through the fucking roof. It was painful how much I needed sex all the time. Since I'm on Lamictal, it significantly lowered. At first, I felt so relieved from a burden, that I am now actually able to say no when I don't want sex, because my body is now inligned with my mind. 

I've been in a relationship for two years and a half, my partner is amazing, but my sex drive is so low now I'd be ok with sex once a month. It's never on my mind, and when it is, it's because now I have to deal with the traumatic side of my sex life which used to be shadowed by my hypersexuality. I'm dealing with the trauma, in therapy. It doesn't help me feel sexy nor desired nor turned on. 

I'm just... Not really interested in sex anymore... Like almost at all. My partner is and I can't follow. He met the two sides of me and we haven't really talked about it. I don't want to make my low libido a thing. But it doesn't really bother me I'm not into sex anymore, but I don't want my partner to feel undesired.

Have you experienced this with Lamictal? Is there a solution out there? It has been great at stabilizing my moods, I love it so much...  But the sex part is ouf."

I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar for a few years now. It’s been one hell of a ride and needless to say my life has changed. I’m handling it a lot better now, though. 
I take a cocktail of meds and can’t do certain things like drink or eat certain foods.

Anyway, it’s pretty late where I am right now and I’m having so much trouble sleeping. For years I’ve been somewhat addicted to Xanax. I’m embarrassed and ashamed to admit it, but when I pop one of those pills it’s the only time I feel normal. God the feeling is so great. I deal with a lot of paranoia due to bipolar, and when I take Xanax these irrational thoughts completely disappear. I’ve become accustomed to using it for sleep sometimes and needless to say I go through withdrawals. I’m even itching to take one right now. I am so ashamed. 

I want to be better. I need help and I believe joining this community will give me support.

A dark side of mania or something different altogether?,2,mdhcl2,4,"Hi guys, looking for some input here.
My BP SO and I need some input to a ""dark side"" of her cycle.

Brief primer:
Diagnosed with BP 2 in 2017 - symptoms presented as mostly depressive episodes with high fatigue and the odd ""up"" spurt. 
April 2020 - went off meds and went cold and bitter, left.
June 2020 - Back on meds and came home. 
Nov 202 - BP 1 diagnosis we discovered she went manic back in April.
Now - appears to cycle rapidly, mixed episodes. Cycle ties into her 4x4 work rotation. Up for work, crash for a day or 2, level for 2 or 3 days. 
Here's the thing...
Last year round this time when she left and a few other times including for the last 2 days she hits this awful scary place. She's cold, bitter, spiteful, unloving. Her mind races to the point of it driving her crazy and hurting. She said she can feel it in her whole body, she feels like she's not her but still is?. She feels gross. Hateful and bitter towards everyone. Can't be reasoned with. She's noticed dizzyness, and headaches after coming out of it. She says she then snaps back ( usually) over night and she's back to my sweet loving wife. When she's hypo or manic she's usually lovely and busy as hell.
Is this the dysphoria mania ive read about or something else entirely?
Any thoughts or imput would be appreciated.
Thanks."

It's been documented that uncontrolled bipolar will eventually cause frontal lobe damage. It's not some joke that "" oh I have a list ready for when I am manic"". That's not coping with this disease.

I gave all those good answers about why don't we grow up and solve our utility's debits and moving out problems first. Style ELI5, he acts like five. Tryed to explain I'll be there, after all 'the ends', even if he has no one else. This is why he shouldn't block me. He has no one. 

Then I changed. 

My mood chart says I'm going downwards since the past few days. Less than a week or so. Change of medications. 

Less than a week feels like aways or so. 

Since I moved on from Lithium to Depakote... Quetiapine would take two more hours to knock me off and the past two days I am dreaming a lot. In those dreams I'm awaken but I'm not? 

Sometime around the first week with new meds, I got addicted to Chigado PD and I've waved a week of classes, failed to delivery two papers. Three days ago stoped to care about my hair and baths. Today I didn't felt the flavor of pizza.

Then I called him. 

He wants to stay with me. I want him to change. 

I ended the call. 

So much thoughts and nothing to describe. How to describe I was crying? 

So hard and no sound, I wanted to yell so hard and my troat was shut I wanted to die so hard. All this time since last time and I wanted to die so hard in despair knowing I actually don't want to. My head just sucks and this is why I want to. Die. For a fact choke myself does not work, i see something sharp so close of me my youngest on the other room even closest I want so bad I can't. Whathefuck I'm thinking I crying so loud so damn loud no sound is made. I can't breath. 

How long it took? Last time it happened so many bad choices were made. Last time this happened my body rejected solid food or something. I do not remember how long last time took. 

As for today I evaluated. As I was trained to. 

Took me every _every_ drop of self control I had left to just breath. I was trained before. By my doctors. At the psychiatric hospital. So, I took my time. This is important. Learn. How to take your time. So, I took my meds. I just wanted to overdose myself. Badly. So, I agreed to myself.

I’ve been diagnosed bipolar for about five months. Obviously, I’ve had it longer than that and it’s roughly 12 years. 

My manic stages cause me to clean my social network of friends and “delete” them. I soon after deactivated my FB (which has helped me mentally) and hurt friends feelings. 

In my eyes, I feel my friend should have reached out to me to ask questions. In her eyes she asked someone else and stopped talking to me.

After this manic phase, I’ve continually tried invite her and her bf over or out for drinks. She never brought to my attention that anything was bothering her. 

After a year and my “recent” diagnosis, my psychiatrist told me to try to reach out to her. This made me write a huge apology and actually telling her that I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar. In my text I even explain that I know it’s not an excuse but I’m not sure what I’ve done wrong. 

A week later she responds very abrasive and says her brother is bipolar and pointed out everything I did wrong (apparently deleting her off FB and not considering her life situations). 

With her response and knowing how she is, I politely told her that I’m sorry and I can’t change the past. I’m trying to do better with myself and if we can be friends still. She still hasn’t responded.


Do other people go through losing friends? I feel like I can’t keep long term friends. I’m not sure if it is because of my tendencies or lack of choosing good people...

But I am curious to know if I will always struggle with this."

"For once, everything actually fits",6,mdegcy,2,"I've been seeing help for a long time. I've seen three different therapists over 6+ years for general anxiety and depressive periods. I learned coping mechanisms that never really felt right. I thought I was just different or my problems weren't severe enough to need help so itherapy would never work. 

Then I saw a new therapist. He just listened for two sessions, hardly said a word. Then at the end of session two, he has me complete two questionnaires. With two words, he completely changed my life. 

Bipolar disorder. I couldn't even think. My mind sort of went numb. It couldn't be bipolar disorder, could it? 

But now, every bit that I learn about bipolar disorder, it makes sense. It feels right. I feel as if I was living in a bubble my entire life.

Ive been just going through memories, and I can see my mania and I can see my lows and how they affected my life dramatically and in different ways. 

Yet, I can only be happy and glad a week later. I have a illness that can be managed, that can be fixed. I can figure out who I really am. 

I just felt the need to share this with someone, anyone really. I've finally found my path for the future!"
I'm not bipolar and I have a question.,8,mdeegg,7,"My fiancee of 1.5 yrs decided to tell me yesterday that we had to break up. That I would be much happier without her and that our relationship was ending. 

Our relationship was amazing we did everything together and she kept getting more and more distant, but that it wasnt me and she still wanted a relationship with me and now this. I'm in shock. She tells me this is bipolar and it can get so much worse.

She has been on lithium for a while and seemed stable when we met. 

What do I do? I am so hurt. Idk if i have been this hurt before. I still live in the same house with her and she wants to pretend it's ok and were just friends now, instantly. 

She told me today that she is going to outpatient treatment for a week or 2 to get her medicine changed. 

Is this bipolar? Do I stay until the new medicine takes effect? I love this woman and I know that she loves me too. I've heard suicidal people try and push people away because they dont want to inconvenience them. Is this that? How do I react? How do i be supportive of her when I'm so hurt by her? Please help me."
Any advice on having kids if you're BP2,1,mdecjo,5,"Hello, me and my husband have been having some serious talks about whether or not it is wise to have kids with my disorder. he is understandably worried that I would become overwhelmed, more subjected to episodes and the effect on my mental health would outweigh the benefits of having a family.

Tips for a depressive episode,2,mde9tf,2,"I’ve gone into a really bad depressive episode, the worst I’ve had in almost a year. I’m not really sure how to manage this being so bad. My medications usually make me manic a lot and the depressive episodes have been manageable. I’ve had suicidal thoughts (I won’t act on them but they are dark and terrifying) and I don’t have the energy to get out of bed.

I thought about going to the hospital for inpatient treatment but school is very important to me so I don’t want to miss it. I’d also feel really guilty if I didn’t go to work.

"meds vs. ""the real me""",3,mdcrdm,7,"So I also have ADHD in addition to bipolar (cyclothymia specifically, was officially diagnosed last year), and i only found out today that adderall can seriously affect mania, bc I noticed i was feeling/acting a lot more manic. Then i started to think: I feel really good when I'm like this. I feel PASSIONATE, i feel MOTIVATED to do things and do things with a vigor! I feel like. A person? I guess. Like, there's how i usually feel which is fine, and then there's truly FEELING when I'm like this.

When I get like this, it makes me feel bummed that I don't feel as human when I'm taking my mood stabilizer. There's that dumb part in the back of my brain that's like ""I'm not being the 'real' me,"" which I feel is a dangerous temptation on my brain's part to get off of meds. There's obviously a reason I'm on them! And I very well might have to be on them for my whole life.

But I just can't help but feel I could be more ""me"" if I wasn't on them. I'm assuming others on here can relate- I'm still in the throes of my mania, so am I just being dramatic? Why does this stupid disorder make me feel this way?? Even if someone could just comment on what they think of all this would be appreciated, I really need to hear the opinion of another person w bipolar. I still feel so new to all of this and kind of alone in my disorder in real life.

(I should note that I would NOT go off meds without the advice of a doctor. My only worry is whether or not this line of thought itself is dangerous.)"

Quit work?,2,mdaq6z,4,"Okay so I’m(28F) currently working in the social care sector and have been doing crisis intervention work for 3 years. I was initially full time but due to having an episode triggered by stress my work and I lowered it to 22.5 hours per week for a better work/life balance. Now I love the people I support and enjoy helping people, but due to the pandemic all agencies are wanting to point fingers and blame and there is a lot of stress in every workplace. Which can be very anxiety inducing for me. I have applied to uni to do nursing in September but won’t find out if I have been accepted until June.
Should I quit my job? It’s not bringing me the satisfaction I once had as it’s nothing like the way it used to be and with the guidelines changing constantly the management aren’t very helpful in clarifying issues or are just as in the dark as us at times. I finished at 4 today and I’m still replaying conversations I had in my mind. I’m taking all my meds but I am hesitant because this is a good job with good pay which means I don’t worry about money too much. Any advice would be helpful."

Origins of Bi-polar,3,mdafzp,9,"I’ve read that the French psychiatrist Jean-Pierre Falret published an article in 1851 describing what he called “la folie circulaire,” which translates to circular insanity. The article details people switching through severe depression and manic excitement, and is considered to be the first documented diagnosis of bipolar disorder.

The abnormal development of the amygdala due to raised cortisol levels can have people with this condition appear anti-social and endless other results of improper treatment

My biggest interest is in epi-genetics and being aware before the energy turns to that way of insanity which needs to be treated. 

I’d love to hear insights on this. I have many writings and thoughts centred around it but they are not organized as I am constantly creating."
I'm afflicted with Mixed Mania and recently I'm deeply craving a relationship..,3,mdaf1q,1,"After about a year now in therapy, the results are mixed but its better than nothing.

Recently I'm insanely craving a relationship (after more than 3 years being in self imposed solitude) I want to be wanted, desired, loved and cared for...  
otherwise I honestly can't bear living alone anymore, it makes everything even more painful and tormenting...

and obviously as you may all expect I already have an interesting girl friend that I find attractive, I'm deeply attached to her and she doesn't seem to care for advancing into anything, I don't blame her everyone has their own lives but her situation comparatively to me is in a way worse health condition MS...

I went full stupid with her and spent a tremendous amount of money on her and gifting her anytime I could and I stopped just recently after she insisted on stopping.  
I don't think I regret it, even if it was unhealthy, at least I made her smile.

Thing is, it now deeply hurts that she seems cold with me lately, and hurts even more feeling that there is no further than this with her, I don't know if I've been played, or if my star just faded to her or maybe she's being truthful and I'm just indulging the paranoia & co this god damned beast of a disorder brings with.

 it is a real agony to extremely invest emotionally with someone just to get not so much of the same investment.

Sadly with where I live and how the world is turning up to be there isn't really a place to go out and hang with new people or meet anyone, and I don't know what to do anymore...  


if someone here hears me, please speak up and answer anything, I'm in despair and lost in what this Mixed Mania left to me, self loathing and blaming and hating..."

Not to take away from the struggle that are meds, but all the recent posts about med side effects and whatnot can make me feel a bit hopeless.

Best treatment / long term / clinical studies,3,md8ivp,3,"Heyyyy, 

Some of y'all might have seen my manic ramblings the past few days. My doc knocked me out with Trazadone and I've been sleeping a ton so I'm feeling overmedicated but not manic. 

Anyways, I'm really sick of all these medicines and therapies which always work for a little bit and then I have another episode and have to start all over. 

I want like really high quality care that can really help me manage this. Someone told me about their family member who went to Johns Hopkins for an intensive program for their BP1. 

I spent time at McLean during my first psychotic episode, and I so regret not taking advantage of that extremely high quality treatment. Mental healthcare in West Michigan is really unremarkable. My doctor at school (Harvard) is absolutely awful — just wants me sedated all the time. 

Where do people that are highly functioning and intelligent find doctors and treatment programs. This may be the manic grandiosity, the potential Narcissistic Personality Disorder, or just the truth, but I feel too intelligent for the treatment I receive. 

Firstly, I can get whatever I want from my doctors, and never ever will get involuntarily committed. I know exactly what to say and do to get anything that I want. I think that's pretty bad, honestly. 

Then, I can't be honest with my doctor, because he is so conservative. I need to tell my doc about all the drugs I have done and currently do, but he told me he'd stop seeing me if I did drugs! He's this bougie acclaimed doctor but he's super old and pretentious and a pill pusher. But! I'm the Harvard kid, so he loves me and believes anything I say. 

Then, I have to sit through all this absolutely mind numbing content on mental health in hospital and partial programs. I understand why and appreciate how accessible the content is, but being as researched and experienced I am with all this programming at this point, I find it really unuseful and kind of patronizing. 

Like, where can I get treatment programming that's at my level of comprehension? I think I could really benefit from private extended time with a doctor and probably a really intelligent therapist to work through my own presentation of Bipolar 1 and iron out a lot of this and get extensive psychoeducation. 

My therapist, too. I really don't mean to sound this way, but I'm extremely intelligent. I am leaps and bounds smarter than my therapist, and I know how to manipulate him. The therapy is helpful where I can just sit and complain to him for an hour a week, but I totally get whatever I want from him, too! 

I want to be in like a case study or something and spend this summer at McLean or something getting this under control. I'm only 21 and I'm having regular and bad episodes. I can only imagine how badly this could progress as I age and don't get good treatment."
Looking for resources,4,md8ihc,9,"Hi everyone. I just want to start by saying how blown away I am by this community. Ive done a lot of scouring around on here and everyone seems to be so supportive and helpful to those that are struggling to live with this condition. 

Ill keep it brief, but my older sister who I love very much was diagnosed 6 years ago. Shes made some really bad choices when she is manic, and she’s been hospitalized twice. This past week, something changed drastically. She feels so guilty for a lot of the choices shes made, and it came out of nowhere. She’s been apologizing nonstop. No matter how many times we tell her we love her and we understand why she made those choices, she wont stop beating herself up over it. We’ve tried like hell to get her professional help but as so many if you probably know, effective mental health care can be really hard to find. 

BUT the most amazing thing that happened this past week, despite all the tears her eyes, was: for the very first time since she was diagnosed I heard her use the words “bipolar”. I heard her say the word “manic”. Up until this point, I was never really sure that she accepted her diagnosis. Which helps to explain why things never really got better for her. I don’t really think she fully grasps what this disorder is and how its affecting her decisions and her mood. 

Does anyone here have any good reading material, books, or other resources that have helped them cope with bipolar? Any good protocols that they have in place for when they feel like they might be manic? 

Again, Im just someone who loves their sister and wants to help. Any advice would really be appreciated."
Hypersexuality and memory?,3,md8fx2,3,Is it normal to not remember the people you slept with during a manic episode? I can’t remember any names or faces and it kinda disturbs me that I lost my virginity to someone I don’t even remember the name of.

Covid is fucking me over,1,md7jl9,4,"I thought I had found a good lite with friends, working out, I moved to a city, bought an apartment.

Multiple Car Crashes?,4,md6s4u,4,"So in the year surrounding my diagnosis I have been in 4 at fault car crashes- during the first I was possibly hypomanic and dude swiped someone while pulling over to help a homeless person. Second happened when I took Benzos as prescribed to come down from a manic episode and was so stoned I drove off the road. In January, seroquel XR was added to my med regimen (previously Seroquel 200, Lamotrigine 200, Clonazepam 0.5. Although I don’t feel too drowsy on it, In February I side swiped someone on the on-ramp to a bridge. Literally only a month later, this morning, I rear-ended someone on the same on ramp. 

I don’t drive recklessly but it seems like I’m in a constant state of being unaware of my surroundings every time I drive. At this rate my insurance premiums may go so high next year I may not be able to drive, and I will have to pay a multi-crash premium of $1000 for being in 3 accidents within 3 years. 

Without my car, it’s a struggle to get to work and I become a shut in that never socializes or goes out to hike. Bussing takes all the energy out of me. But I’m terrified to drive again and don’t know if I will ever be able to drive normally.

I just don’t know what the hell is wrong with me. Has anyone been in a similar situation?"
Psych suggested hospitalization,3,md6pf2,6,"First time poster and I just joined today. Here’s a little back story for anyone who cares. I was diagnosed about a year ago after multiple other diagnosis. I’ve been hospitalized before twice but since I’ve been working hard and taking my meds, I’ve been doing pretty ok, which is good in my opinion. 

Well the last three months have been stressful at work where I’m absolutely over working myself in fear of losing my job and letting people down. And it doesn’t pay for shit so I’m screwing my family financing.  I’m also almost done with college. Just got to get to the end of the semester.  I have a toddler.  I’m drowning. 

I haven’t self harmed or had suicidal ideation in almost three years but the last two months have been hell.  Deep mood swings, hallucinations, impulsive behavior, absolute avoidance of EVERYTHING. It came to a head yesterday and my psych wants me to take a leave of absence from work to be hospitalized.  She says it’s because of my symptoms becoming out of control but I can’t help thinking I’m over dramatizing how I feel. Like I need to work harder. 

I’m refusing hospitalization because I’m scared to go and I don’t know how it would help. I think I would feel worse away from home, around strangers, and so restricted.    Plus, $$. This leave of absence is going to eat up vacation time and then the rest is unpaid. 

I’m a burden and it’s because I won’t do better. I had to ask my dr like 5 times if I was t just making a big deal out of nothing because I can’t accept that this is a real and serious situation.   I don’t know what to do.  I don’t know how to deal with Bipolar Disorder.  

I don’t know if I should go...   sorry this is so god awful long."
So am I a whiney b!tch? Only for those in committed relationships. It’s complicated,4,md6dgy,3,"Super long so sorry: So my hubs and I are almost 3 weeks into trial separation. I’m taking my meds like clockwork, scared to death of some sort of episode. I have been spending like crazy. Im trying to just put the card down!! So last week, we were like a couple of teenagers, calling, sexting, he ‘visited’ our home 3 times. This week we have both been very busy. He had the kids for five days and they came home Tuesday. They have been hateful, mostly I think from being tired and the huge change. It was their first time at their dad’s place. We are getting along great. This is a mental health separation, to hopefully benefit both of us. We still love each other very much but we were driving each other insane. He has started therapy and has improved exponentially so there is already some good coming from it. Not sure but I think his therapist may have told him to keep me at a healthy distance for his own good. Anyway, skip to last night...I took a small break from reality they I haven’t had to watch some Netflix after the kids are in bed. Didn’t realize I was watching such mushy hallmark movie romance fodder until it was too late. I’m blubbering over a couple jumping into each other’s arms after just divorcing. I mean ugly crying. I shut it off as fast as I can, run to bed and assume the fetal position, crying myself to sleep. Forgot to mention I got a diagnosis of skin lupus yesterday. Apparently, it’s fine as long as I take the pill they ask me to. Then I find out there may be a reaction to one of my ‘crazy pills’ that could cause heart problems. I haven’t talked to anyone about this lupus stuff until yesterday when I found out, mostly bc I didn’t want the 20 questions that came with it (and now I realize I was a little scared of what I may find out). My mom was absolutely no help. She want to pine away after my dad who’s been gone 2 years. That is another tragic tale I’ll save for another time. But I selfishly wanted her to help me, not commiserate on how much it sucks to be alone. She was talking to me more like a friend instead of a mom. I know that’s childish but it was making me feel worse. Damn, I miss my dad too. He would have known how to calm me down over this diagnosis stuff. So hubs left me alone after I told him I was fine. Today I’m not fine. I’m freaking the fuck out, afraid this is a trigger into depression. I get the kids off to school and immediately go to bed and resume the position. He checks on me via text. I tell him a little about last night after some prodding. He immediately wants to fix it all. Here’s the kicker. He has, well, we have, always called his mom if we need anything. We’ve been very blessed to have her around bc my mom hasn’t been able to, bc she has BP1 and other health issues which prevents her from driving. Hubs knows she usually makes me worse when I’m upset, even though I always call her. 
So the mother-in-law...duh duh DUH!!! She’s an overbearing, rude, wreckless, dangerous, stubborn, and some would say evil force to be reckoned with. I am not. We have fought over her for our entire marriage. She has essentially been a third party in our marriage and it has taken me until last October to finally stand up to her and hubs about it. She always kept the kids when we’re having an bad day or when he wanted to drink on a weekend when I was working. She never complied with our preferences on caring for our kids, since they were babies. I mean she didn’t like the fact that she had to heat up my breast milk to feed them when I was at work(it’s nasty and slimy! What the fuck do you think it’s for?!) I digress. So I was having a bad day after a bad night. Tried to talk to my mom. No go. She’s manic at the moment and no help. Hubs texted and decided he would ‘save the day’ and just call his mom. She’s more than happy to swoop in and save us and take the kids for the night. I have done everything in my ability to ask her for as little help as possible to prove to him that we don’t need her in our lives. Well he says I’m having a hard day emotionally and it’s ok to ask for help when we need it. I feel like I need to put on my big girl panties and get over it. That they’re my responsibility. I dont just get to wave my white flag every time I’m having a bad day. The shittiest part is that even though she does things her own way, and she pisses me off, she always has the best intentions, she does a better job with my kids than I do. She’s there for me when my crazy mom can’t be. I resent her for that and she’s trying to help me. What the fuck is wrong with me? She’s tough as hell and loves being so involved in our family. She a force to be reckoned with. I think over half of my therapy sessions are about her. Shew! Sorry, this is a long rant."
Anyone know where to find a study comparing different illness and quality of life?,1,md5snb,1,"If I remember correctlty someone on reddit posted a link to a study comparing illness like bipolar, cancer, losing an arm, deafness (a long list) that sums up which illness had the most impact on a persons quality of life.

Night Mania,1,md5q7j,7,"I have a friend who had a lot of drug abuse issues and recently got sober. I spent a lot of time with him and noticed a weird cycle that I think may be some type of bipolar disorder.

During the day he's fairly low energy and depressed but somewhat talkative. He just seems normal to me during this time and you can have a back and forth convo.

My friends and I noticed at night that he goes into a manic state where he basically just talks at you and he paces a ton. It's very very hard to get a word in and he talks over people. My friend got freaked out because she talked to him at midnight and he talked at her for like 3 hours and she couldn't get a word in. I talked to him that same day in the afternoon and the conversation was normal. 

Is there a bipolar disorder where you have a daily cycle of depression/mania? The only other idea is that he is getting jacked up on nicotine/caffeine maybe but his mind seems very effected.

He also works nights so maybe that's why he's so all over the place each day?

I was just thinking that he might have some undiagnosed bipolar type issue And that maybe he's been self medicating with drugs and that's why he has had drug problems. I think his therapist wouldn't catch this cycle because he's never going to see his therapist at night when he's in a manic state."

BiPolar... ish? (TW: Self Harm & Dangerous Behavior),3,md4eyx,2,"I recently had a melt-down after having held my shit together for 12 years (or so I believed). The trigger was the implosion of my relationship and living situation. I always stuck with the diagnosis I was given at the age of 14; major depression. After this meltdown, I started seeing both a psychiatrist and a therapist. They are both of the thinking that I am some form of BP. I took some time to research what that actually meant, what kind of behaviors are associated with it. And I was at first a bit upset that it fit like a glove. I don't feel I've ever had a truly manic episode (psychosis), but I have definitely experienced hypomania (hypersexuality, impulsiveness, excitability, disjointed/racing speech). I don't feel upset necessarily anymore, but I just don't know what to do with this information.

I've been back at work now for a month, and nothing feels right still. It's impossible for me to focus, I feel like I haven't completed a single thing by myself since all this started. My therapist thinks that until my medications are figured out, that I should be meditating and journaling (reddit counts, right?). These all sound like great ideas and all, but in the moment, right now, here at work.. that shit doesn't help. I'm faking everything right now. Everything. I've not shown up on time for work since before all of this happened. I'm sleeping now, but barely able to wake up. I finally started eating again, but really I would just rather drink than eat. It's like I have two brains, one of which that wants to remain functioning, and the other that just wants to not exist, contribute or interact with the world...

My ex reaches out every few days, which I feel is akin to throwing a bowling ball into a spinning washing machine. He's fucked up too, but in the untreated way. I still have these impulses to have sex with him, or to reach out to him, or to hang out with him. Obviously my brain knows that the end result is detrimental, but the fucked up part of me doesn't care???? 

I'm 17,000 dollars in the hole after this meltdown, I nearly cleared my entire savings account with my 'hypo'manic spending sprees. I nearly lost my job. I live in a shitty studio now. I have neglected key relationships that could have provided support during this time. I'm coming out of the hole and realizing how much I've truly fucked myself. The latest urges are still to spend every bit of money I have on stuff/things/crap/junk and self harm. 

I feel like there isn't enough time in the day either. I have some OCD behaviors that are compounding these feelings. I clean excessively every night. Vacuuming, mopping, dusting, sorting, donating, spring type cleaning. Every. Single. Night. After a good 4 hours, I feel like I can actually sleep, like something is not amiss and like I'm being productive, but I know that this isn't the case. I clean to keep myself from drinking and to keep myself from thinking about it. I've been compulsively chewing at my nails. My fingers are bloody and raw every morning when I wake up. I like drawing but I can't make time for it with these OCD routines. I also feel like shit and lack the motivation to sit down and draw something. 

WTF do I do with all of this..."
Does anyone else ever lie to their doctors because you’re afraid they’ll give up when they find out what you’ve really been up to?,22,md41qb,19,"Like, if my doctor finds out I’ve not been doing the things I need to do to be healthy, will they eventually just drop me?"
Have you ever quit your job because it was getting too much for your mental health?,1,md2zix,6,"My current work environment is extremely toxic and stressful. I go to work, worry about it, come home and keep problem-solving in my brain and I go back to it the next morning. This job is also just to pay the bills so it's not like it's my dream job. Anyways, I asked my boss to work less hours ( which I know wont affect the team) and he said no and offered to lower my wage but not to lower my workload. I am so beyond over it right now. I was such a dedicated employee and a team player and tried to get as much off of everyone's plate as possible. I feel like my request wasn't unreasonable but I also feel like Im not a valued member of the team... that's what bothers me the most... I'm grinding myself to dust but am not treated with empathy...  So I have my 2 weeks notice drafted and made an appointment with my doctor to go on stress leave and at least get paid for that. Then the plan is to send the 2 weeks notice the minute I'm back from stress leave. But I'm afraid. I haven't slept all night. I woke up crying and with tremors so I called in sick, but its more like I called in ""go F yourself"". 
I need advice from someone who's been through it or going through it right now. I feel very alone and all my friends and family don't understand why Im this anxious. All they said is just ""quit!!!"" right away, for months, and my worries are ""just anxiety"". But there are real life consequences to leaving or staying especially for people like us. I'm worried the depression will intensify, I'm worried I wont be able to afford therapy, I'm worried I'll spiral. You get the picture. So if you've been through it, how did you manage the transition? How did you pull the trigger? 
Sorry for the long post and if you've made it this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart because it means I was heard :) 
Thank you for being such a supportive community!!"

All over the place. Can’t really focus either. I just got out of a very long depression, and so now I’m nervous for when this episode might end. 

Currently I only take Abilify and just started that so I’m wondering if that has anything to do with it. What are peoples experience with it?"

Does anyone else get so tired of their depression that they miss being manic sometimes?,28,mczvhc,11,"Let me explain, there are a lot of bad things about mania that I DO NOT MISS and wouldn't wish on anyone (such as insomnia, paranoia, bad social habits, hyper-sexuality, etc). Thanks to my medication and other healthy habits, I'm coming up on 9 months since my last full blow manic episode. However, I feel depressed more often than not. It's gotten so bad recently that I think back to how I used to feel. Intense euphoria, total self confidence, and feeling energized and motivated to do the things I've always wanted to do. I understand the flaw in this reasoning, I'm only posting this in hopes that I'm not alone in feeling this way."
Sh when I'm not necessarily depressed,6,mczkt6,13,"Does anyone else get the urge to sh when you feel good? Like, the rush I get from it feels good sometimes. I do it both when I'm depressed and when I'm not. Definitely more when I'm depressed though.
 
I don't know if my sh is caused by my depression... I think I just genuinely like it as like... an activity. And my parents never really did a whole lot to stop me. They just kinda let me do it. Maybe it has something to do with how my parents have treated me but I've never really seen it as all that bad. I never do it where it could like.... kill me? I mean the worst that happens is I scar and I won't lie I kind of like the scarring. It validates that what I'm experiencing is physical and real. But seriously I don't necessarily understand what is so bad about sh. Why it's seen as such a gross and disgusting thing. I'm not trying to justify it as a good thing but I do have a hard time understanding why it is so stigmatized."

On an up-swing?,1,mcy1ot,5,"I've been feeling better. 

The low wasn't *too low* ... I kept my wits about me,  Made my lists, Checked the boxes, and made it through...

Recently, I've had more energy and just felt ok.  But the hyper has been creeping in.... Not too bad, totally manageable.

I've been thinking about asking my partner about doing something I know he would like. It's one of those ""soft limit"" things for me (maybe a ""medium limit"" 🤔)... 2 days ago I mentioned it.  He got excited, but he understands my concerns. I trust him to be cautious. 

Yesterday, at work... The hyper ticked up a notch... I noticed just how hot our young new manager is... And I delivered to a customer that I just wanted to jump! Racing, (hyper)sexual thoughts... 

I had already told my partner about the manager... Then the customer.... And given the suggestion I made the night before....  that's when I made the connection and told him... This feels like an up-swing.  His reaction was positive ---- ""Nice!!!"" 

.... He knows this means sexual adventures and fun... And I'm all good with that part... But sometimes I wonder if he really understands how much I am coming to depend on him to keep me safe when this happens.  I have pointed out things that we did that I would not have done if I weren't Manic.  I don't regret those things, but it is still a bit scary.

Experience with abilify?,2,mcvri5,14,I was diagnosed bipolar 2 and preceded abilify and I’ve heard so many horror stories....
Anyone interested in being friends? Female only,1,mcv6fh,8,I have friends but they are all busy with their lives. So would be nice to chat with other people.
I just found out the reason I didn't get promoted is because... take a guess guys...,3,mcus1h,5,"Because they're afraid they ""don't know how to deal with me"".

I work in the kitchen of a well-known restaurant/entertainment venue. Was doing dish and just started as a cook, and brought in my friend (who worked here before quarantine but hadn't really worked in the industry before that) to help me out with dish.

Soon, friend tells my boss he wants to cook, now he is a full-time cook, and I don't even get a single day on the line. Huh?!

The explanations I got were that ""he has experience cooking"" (lol, fucking liar, he didn't when I asked him last year. Did he cook for the other prisoners when he got... bored... over quarantine and stabbed someone?) and... get this... ""we didn't think you'd mind"".

But tonight I FT'd my Best Work Friend because this turned out to be just one layer of the drama going on in our kitchen. Long story short, we are REALLY short staffed and very few of our cooks are reliable. I'm ready to go, but they're not ready to deal with me.

But the excuses are contradictory. Apparently once I made too many fries and this was some HUGE deal that everyone was talking about. No one had communicated it to me. My boss said I did good. All I can think at this point was that I was being set up for failure.

I just think they all know by now that I'm too much. My GM told me I ""disappear"" too much, which I guess some people have made the connection to my anxiety (the GM didn't until I told him... a couple others confirmed they don't think he understands anxiety at all.) They've seen me get stressed before, but with all that's happened in the past week it's gotten to the point where I picked a fight with a manager (my former boss, who I 90% blame for this situation.) I've had TWO sit downs with the GM, who pretty much told me I sucked and insinuated that I was a ""slow learner"" (that one is a MAJOR FUCKING TRIGGER for me, having mild learning issues that with meds make me seem even dumber sometimes... people have made fun of me for it for YEARS.) He then gave me a raise, to which I was like whaaa?) but now I realize it was basically just to shut me up. Turns out they've been giving raises to legit everyone in hopes they won't leave... but if I wasn't starving for money right now (AND I GAVE UP BASICALLY LIFETIME SSDI FOR THIS PLACE) I'd probably be quitting. Everyone else is.

I'm just so upset. I have told them I have ""mental health issues"" but never gone into detail about them... since I figure like my GM with anxiety, most people who don't deal with it don't understand it. And bipolar is a whole different beast. When people hear it, they think... crazy, angry, violent. My friend made it clear that they're less concerned about ""hurting my feelings"" than what my reactions will be... so I'm honestly kinda happy they're scared of me, which I know really isn't a good thing...

All I know is I can't sleep tonight because this is going on. And I have work tomorrow. Yay, another sleepless night... you know how well those work out for us..."

wow im so very tired. thia whole mental health thing makes me feel like even at times in the past where ive felt happy safe and okay feels like they have brushed over by things that happened after and all the light that used to be in those memories turn dim instead. im afraid because i feel like any traumatic events i got through i think that it cant get worse and im just proven wrong?

im sad that i know people leaving is a part of life but i cant help but think about everything i couldve done right and they could have stayed instead. 

i really, really miss my ex but i feel so hurt by the fact he left, even though i know that was the healthiest option for him. i hope that with time i heal but im afraid of things in the future too. 

i thought id be okay by now but my diagnosis changed and so much happened and im too afraid of believing that things get better because i dont want that false hope anymore.

I have a horrible habit of quitting jobs recently?,3,mcrocm,2,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder June of 2020. The reason I went to the doctor in the first place was because I was having a psychotic episode which lasted about a week, and it seemed so out of place for me and my regular mental struggles. Well since being diagnosed, I have been more aware of my behavior and have been trying to understand myself more.  


Since being diagnosed, I have worked a total of 7 different jobs, in the span of 11 months. I'm not sure what happens or why, but I just seem to go borderline psychotic and end up attempting suicide, which results in me either not showing up to work because I am behaving as a threat to myself, or me being fired because I am unstable to be around at work. I'm not sure if it's the type of jobs I'm getting, or if it's 100% just all in my head.  


Every single job has been minimum wage, mainly working in the kitchen due to my severe social anxiety, which does make me feel worthless and out of place, because I am 22 years old with no education past a high school diploma. I don't enjoy anything and I literally come home from work and just wither away til the next day, so maybe that does have some sort of impact on why I am quitting jobs.  


I've worked 3 jobs which were long-term, but I was younger at the time. I lasted 2 years at one job, a year and a half at another, and 8 months at another. I was really depressed and had anxiety during those years too, but I feel like it has gotten 10x worse the older I get, and the more useless and a burden I feel.  


My question really is would me getting a higher paying job, a less stressful one, or one with great coworkers and a good schedule for me be worth it? Or would my brain trick me into quitting that job too? Am I too unstable to work nowadays? Is there something I can do to stop quitting jobs that I have no future or career advances at?  


I'm not blaming anybody or anything besides myself in this situation. I have made so many bad decisions and it's clear that they have affected me long-term. I just really wish I would stop making irrational decisions and doing everything impulsively.   


Also to mention, I have not had any treatment for bipolar, but I have been on a handful of medications in the past for depression, anxiety, and insomnia. With that being said, would it be a good idea to try and pursue treatment for it? I've had no success with any medications or therapy in the past, but I'm really not sure what to do anymore."
DAE reoccurring dreams?,2,mcrioe,3,"I’m not talking like occasionally, I’m having the same type/feeling of a dream every single time I go to sleep lately, it’s always somewhere familiar in my childhood, my schools, hometown, neighboring towns ect. There’s literally never anyone else in the dreams, just me; and I’m always just running away, trying to get as far as way from the starting point as possible and I have no idea what I’m trying to get away from or towards. 
Not to mention throughout the day I’m being hit with random memories of random dreams throughout years? Anyone got anything on that? 

*This has been frequent since prior to my diagnosis and throughout all medications so this is not a Med side effect."

I have no idea,1,mcr2zc,2,"This is just a rant. (23M)

TLDR: I have no idea what to choose, stuck between father and my boss.

I'm posting this here as I have no one to actually rant this to. So I know I'm anonymous here.

I have a full-time work in marketing, but really want to go into IT. Problem is the IT position is only an internship. Now the problem here is I live in South Africa where the jobless % is just over 40%. So if I take the internship of 6 month's I have a chance to not have work after that then I'm pretty much fucked. I have no idea what to do.

I was in the hospital a month ago because I tried to commit suicide. But when I came out my boss started to push me away from my work and trying to get me out of this company. So he found this internship for me. Now my father is pissed as it is clear hebis discriminating against me because of my BD. I have no fucking idea what to do. As I want to take the internship but that is going against my father and taking a poes big risk. Or I stay where I am and have to work with a boss that doesn't like me.

All this is just getting way to much again. So yea, sorta lost and got no idea what to fucking do.

But no one understands. No one gets what this particular brand of depression feels like. No one understands that dying will make all of the hurt go away.

My brain is complicated and awful, and I feel like I can’t breathe sometimes.

It’s just a shame that I’m such a fucking weenie. My natural self-preservation instincts are too strong. But I still want to die. And I feel like I might be able to go through with it if I fall into psychosis, or if this depression—somehow—manages to get any worse.

Like I just wish I hadn't done that review so that I would be done. But damn I could really use that money after having 2 outpatient programs and being hospitalized.

I finally went to sleep at 730 after putting my kids in bed and hoping they would stay there. 
The way I was treated at work was wrong but my over reaction is embarrasing. I wanted to quick my job when I was manic but I need the money. I have worked there for three years.

Do others have anger issues with depression?,15,mcpy2f,13,I swear when I'm feeling a lot of depression symptoms I get really angry. I lash out like a trapped animal.
Good Mood Impulsivity?,2,mcpw3y,2," 

I am not suicidal. I have no plan, I am actually in a pretty great mood, plenty of supports in place, etc.

But the other night I was walking and something sort of strange happened. I go for a walk every night, but it was a little later than usual and I had walked to a new area that I hadn't visited before. There was this mainly pedestrian/biking bridge that went over a stretch of highway.

Even though I was in a great mood from the lovely walk, I started thinking of jumping off the bridge. I went to the side of the bridge and hopped up on the guardrail right around where I could jump off and roll a landing - not at the highway part, but just where the bridge started to meet the ground again - just to see what it would feel like and the ""guts"" it would have to take. I jumped and rolled and thought, ""Whew, I don't know if I could do that fast enough that someone wouldn't notice me sitting on the guardrail"". I walked back to the middle of the bridge, contemplated jumping, pretty much shrugged and then continued on my walk.  
This kind of thing has happened before to me, curious to know if I am not alone.

So my questions -

1. Do you think there is a chance you would ever impulsively commit suicide? Not out of anger or depression, simply due to opportunity?
2. Have you ever felt the pull of suicide when you were in a good mood?

Thanks for your input! And just to reiterate - I am not suicidal. I do have supports, including an appt with my psych tomorrow, so no worries there. Just wondering about others' experiences!"
How about being ghosted by your friends?,15,mcpv6s,7,"Saw a post earlier about ghosting others because of e.g. toxic relationships, past-traumas, indifferent/apathetic relationships etc.

But what’s difficult for me and my bipolar is how I feel “ghosted” or left behind by the people in my life, including my closest friends and past SOs. It’s especially hard since I also experience paranoia, and in the past I know how much my bipolar has weighed on my relationships (platonic and romantic) and I feel eventually they no longer wanted to be around me / with me / hang with me because of feeling like a burden.

The hardest thing is with COVID and how important connection and communication is digitally or virtually since many of us can’t or couldn’t meet in person. So, I reach out to people, even if it’s a simple “hey how is it going?” and much of the time I don’t get responses. I live alone, and reaching out is all I can do nowadays, and it breaks my heart how isolated and forgotten I feel.

Anyways, thought I’d share my thoughts and struggles. If anyone feels the same, you have my shoulder to lean on."

anyone bipolar that has been addicted to w33d? i need some help,8,mcpa8x,20,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and psychosis for over a year now and i’ve been on 4 different antidepressants and none of them seemed to work. after experiencing my first intense manic episode my therapist told me it sounded like BP. i don’t want to self diagnose but my brother is bipolar and me having it makes sense. I got a  psychological eval with 3 doctors and several test packets but my mom won’t show me the results and her excuse is she never got them (she doesn’t want to admit that i could be BP like my brother) which is bs because i took the tests over multiple days in the mental hospital. anyways, i was doing better over the summer but after a fall out in october with my friend group, best friends, and ex bf I attempted and was admitted to the mental hospital for my 3rd time that year. when i returned home i didn’t feel any better and turned to weed. i smoked daily ALOT from october to february. I smoked carts and dry daily going through a gram cart in 2-3 days not including dry and eddies. keep in mind i’m only 100 lbs. in the beginning of january i was out of money and had to be sober for two days. the withdrawals were terrible i couldn’t eat, sleep or do anything but throw up and lay down in an even more depressive state. after that i realized i was addicted. i know weed is easier to quit for some people but I used it to self medicate and relied on it due to my depression (and possibly BP??)with out it even before i wasn’t sleeping without sleeping meds or eating unless i force fed myself. in february I decided to take a tolerance break for 5 days. same thing happened with withdrawals except this time i didn’t only have the physical symptoms but i had entered a manic episode. i didn’t sleep for multiple days and stayed up doing old homework assignments, making films and doing random shi i wouldn’t usually do. after the five days was up i went back to smoking as much as i was before. a month ago my brother was checking into rehab (same one with BP). i told myself by the time he got home I would be sober too. a week ago i started weening slowly and made my cart last a week and only smoked one 6lunt. sunday was my first day sober and i woke up monday and puked (which i totally expected) the rest of the day i was busy which helped distract me from the withdrawals. today is my fourth day sober and i’m feeling incredibly good. yes this seems like a great thing to hear but this is usually how my manic episodes begin. i feel like so good that i couldn’t imagine ever being as depressed as i once was. the only thing that is different is i haven’t been having impulses, i’ve been able to sleep and my energy doesn’t seem manic at all. i’m genuinely confused because i usually can’t tell when i’m manic at first until i do smtg that’s obviously impulsive or dumb. idk if it’s me feeling so good from being sober or what but it just seems too good to be true if you know what i mean. i mean i still haven’t been able to eat much and i’ve been having raging head and body aches and i’ve been dissociating a lot more in the past 4 days. basically i made this post to see if there are any other people out there that have suffered from a w33d addiction and are bipolar. and if so did u ever get manic when going through withdrawals? i just need some help i feel so lost"
What are the risks of taking expired Rexulti?,2,mcp456,6,"I ran out of my Rexulti and am in the process of switching pharamacies.  I have some older Rexulti that I've been taking but I think it's way too old and expired.  This morning, it felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest and it's starting to do it again.  I thought it might be the bupropion (an NDRI), but I don't think it is since I take the 300mg 12-hour XL and I'm experiencing these side effects after I take my Rexulti and before I take my bupropion. The bupropion was prescribed to me recently last Friday and I have been taking it once a day since.

*Are there any severe side effects I should be wary of, or is this very rapid heartbeat a side effect of something else?*

It feels more like a panic attack than a heart attack.  However, the bupropion side effects incudes (in rare cases) this symptom I am experiencing.  I did call my doctor to inform them but they haven't called me back yet with a solution.

I'm feeling relatively hypomanic and don't want to slip into mania.  The first anti-depressant I took (an SSRI) also gave a hard side effect for a few days.  I think it was high blood pressure, although I was in much better condition and could handle it better.

*Lastly, what is the tipping point where I need to head to the emergency room?*

P.S. My heartrate has slowed down tremendously since writing this.

I know this isn't the place for medical advice, so if no one has experience with this, then which subreddit should I post to?

Thank you in advance!"
"It took me 4 years to accept my diagnosis, I finally did this past week (my story, long read)",5,mcolio,6,"I apologize for the length. I just started writing and didn't realize.

I wasn't diagnosed till I was 33 years old. I avoided doctors like the plague in spite of being in and out of therapy since I was 11 years old and being incapable of acknowledging that anything was ever bothering me about my emotions. I just managed to learn how to suppress noticeable outward displays of emotion. I was raised to believe that unless you've got a fever and you're puking, you go to school or work no matter what. That combined with extreme emotion suppression and major childhood trauma, I managed to convince myself completely nothing was ever wrong. Combine that with the fact that I have difficulty remembering my emotions within a few days. I intellectually know what they might have been or roughly been, but I can't feel any connection to them or even what they were at times unless it's something extreme which is rare.

With that said, I have a very broken sense of when things are a problem. It doesn't register with me at all and in my head I've thought that it's no big deal because no one notices because I'm doing the shit behind closed doors away from people. So you then wind up with what amounts to macho shit where you don't get help and justify not ever getting help. You eventually take weed because all you do is feel all over the place emotionally. 

That gives a break at night. For awhile anyway. Then you wake up one day in the spring of 2017 and you noticed that you're paranoid. Your afraid you're sick with some disease that's going to kill you...and not just that, but your death is imminent at any minute. Every pain in your body, you think that's the one that's going to break your entire body into nothing. You spend weeks like this. You're afraid of neighbors calling the police over you smoking weed for no real reason. It becomes unbearable. 

Turns out that was the build to the main event. 

The main event is here. It's not 15 rounds of a heavyweight boxing match in the 1970s. The opponent isn't Ali or Smokin' Joe. It's entirely unseen so you don't even know what you're fighting against.

Suddenly, you're looking at the most testing 2-3 weeks of your life to that point. Confidence has come on full blast. You're not a confident person at all, but this new feeling makes you wonder...what the hell took so goddamn long to get this feeling back? The backseat passenger is in full control behind the wheel and the ride begins.

You feel free as a person. Sleep dwindles to 2-3 hours a night. Energy isn't a problem. In fact it's unlimited nearly. Grandiose plans begin to dance behind your eyes. You know exactly how to fix the American political system. You are going to run for president and be the great unifier that ushers in a new age for all Americans that will raise the standard of living. You'll change the world. 

Meanwhile, your favorite hobby of riding motorcycles takes a new twist. You've prided yourself on learning to be a good rider who is careful on the streets and doesn't take dumb risks. You're finding yourself increasingly agitated with every vehicle on the road. So you're now passing people on double solid yellow lines into blind corners. Over 100MPH down desolate country roads. Double the speed limit everywhere on the bike.

Racing thoughts so intense you can't get to sleep when you are desperate to sleep because your brain won't shut off. You wind up punching yourself in the head some nights to get it to stop. 

You decide it's time to lose weight. So you lose 10lbs in a week because you realize with all this energy, food has become a minimal requirement. And when all is said and done over 2-3 weeks you've lost 20lbs almost. But goals are what count and accomplishing then even more. You feel like you know the secret to the universe.

Then things start getting to be too much. You want off the rollercoaster ride from hell that this has turned into. You just want to be able to sleep again. You want to feel like the world is not on warp speed. One day you collapse at your desk in exhaustion. You manage to find enough energy to leave work and head home nearly falling asleep driving because of how tired you are. You make it home amazingly and collapse on your couch that afternoon and don't wake up till the next day. Only to be greeted by a depression so deep and profound it feels like a black hole opened in your chest. Time for a doctor. 

They fuck up and because of a bad med reaction you try to kill yourself and wind up in the psychiatric unit for a week. Then you get put on heavy duty psychiatric meds and turn into a zombie for two years. Bad things happen during this time. One day you have had enough and go off everything cold turkey in spite of the warnings. You are an emotional wreck but you pull through somehow because that's all you've ever known. Things seem okay at that point. But then life happens and things start becoming inconsistent. Then you're hot with another emotional trauma and your mind does something different. It emotionally shuts down. You still feel some emotion but it is greatly blunted in feeling. Then that old friend derealization comes back. Your mind is actually in some strange way is trying to save you rather than kill you this time, but you don't realize it yet. 

Time goes by and even with blunted emotions the things that happened in 2017 start happening again. Not all, but a lot. The period is much longer than it was then. Eventually the crash hits but the crash isn't as bad thankfully. It's also at this time you realize you weigh about as much as you did when you were 14-15 years old. You've lost more weight.You realize though you're beginning to have more and more anxiety problems so on an unrelated issue you talk to your primary care doctor. Then you ask if they can give you klonopin because you're having anxiety issues. They tell you they'll do it once but that you need to see a psychiatrist because you're bipolar and they don't want to get involved in that aspect of care. You think to yourself, ""fuck, I didn't remember that I told the doc that."" So you ask for recommendations, you get a few names, and only one is taking new patients. They don't take health insurance but you say fuck it, who cares. This is my chance to get a new diagnosis anyway. This bipolar thing is for the fucking birds. I've accomplished too much in life to be bipolar. That's for other people. I haven't agreed with the diagnosis for 4 years but so be it, I'll just get this over with and get something different and my klonopin. 

The night before, I'm nervous. I don't know why. It's a doctor's appointment. Been to hundreds. This should be no different. Yet something feels different. The next day the appointment happens. The usual psychiatrist history intake happens. Done this numerous times. It's routine now. Just give me my new diagnosis so I can put this bipolar thing behind me. But as I'm talking, I find myself getting agitated. I know why. Because hearing the words coming out of my mouth sounds really bad now. I'm describing emotional issues that don't go back to 2017, but to even before i was a teenager. I get done telling everything. He goes to me, in a way that is hard to describe. You'd have to hear it to get it, and it wasn't sarcastic even though it might come across that way in writing. He goes, ""Oh yeah, you're definitely bipolar."" 

Hearing the way he said it, something in my brain said, ""It's time. Give it up already dude, you can't fight this anymore. You're mentally exhausted and trying to convince yourself otherwise for no good reason other than to prove something to god knows who at this point, has cost you half your life at this point."" 

He also did something none of the other doctors did because he was so horrified by the amount of stuff I had gotten put on 4 years earlier and at the dosages used, he went with one thing to start out with. Risperidone. And ambien because my sleep had gone to shit months ago. He also told me that untreated, it gets worse over time. I realized he was right. Even though I got even better at hiding everything from people and the world, the episodes whether depressive or manic, have been increasing in intensity the last 10 years. Kicker was a friend of mine told me she thought I was bipolar 10 years ago. She is bipolar and saw things that no one else was seeing  I laughed at her when she suggested it. Turned out she knew. 

So after several days on risperidone, my mind cleared up big time. I never realized how bad my focus had gotten. I didn't realize how bad the chaos in my mind had gotten. I feel calmer than i ever have since I was 7 years old. I even feel emotions I haven't felt in years. Perhaps unbelievably, I actually even felt genuine happiness that wasn't tied into anything. It's surreal. I'm incredulous that this drug could make such a difference in such a short window of time. But I know this one can. Now, things aren't perfect, because another med week be introduced next month, and anxiety is still an issue. However, getting some kind of relief mentally without being a near comatose zombie many days is awesome. I actually feel like a person again. 

I can't believe it took this long. I did not think relief existed. I can truly take one day at a time as long as I feel like this. I also realized why I thought therapy was useless. I was never medicated when I did it out I was over medicated. 

I'm trying to be kinder to myself even though it's tough. But I think it's time to go back to my old therapist now. Though the one thing I said to my friend the other night is, I don't know how I let this get so badly out of control. I didn't know better because of how I was raised and I really did not mean to get this sick. It's frustrating in that regard. 

Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I just want to tell everyone that I can be incredibly cynical at times, and I did not believe there was any hope to be found, but there is. No matter how dark things get, and I know how dark they can be, never give up. Keep fighting. Something does eventually give. There really can be light at the end of the tunnel."

"Do you ever feel (even on medication) that your bipolar diagnosis is untrue, and that you are just an extra spiritual human being?",104,mcnyin,102,"I understand if this makes people uncomfortable. But 10 years later I still have issues reconciling my manic episode (bipolar I). Even after years of medication, I still believe many of my “delusions” to be true, and I don’t think my “hallucinations” were hallucinations, still to this day I believe they are real. Sorry if this is not allowed or is triggering to anyone, love to all"
Hallucinations and constantly waking up during the night??,6,mcnmwu,7,"Every since I’ve been young, I’ve had troubles falling asleep and even staying asleep. As I grew older, insomnia got worse and I started having what I believe to be auditory hallucinations as I try to fall asleep. Hearing conversations from others around me or ones I’m personally involved in. It’s already so difficult for me to tell dreams apart from reality, but these especially. They always occur as I’m trying to fall asleep and cause me to wake up startled when they end. Not much time passes and this can happen like 5-6 times in the span of an hour. I take 2-3 mg of clonidine to help me fall asleep at night, but they’ve not impacted these hallucinations (haven’t increased of decreased their amount). As stress gets worse I notice that I seem to hallucinate more or longer. The only things I’ve noticed is they help me with anxiety, falling asleep, but I also wake up many more times during the night now. 

I guess what I’m trying to ask is, are these hallucinations? Could clonidine or just high stress, or both, be the cause of me waking up so much more often during the night and cause an increase of hallucinations? And what can I do to stop the hallucinations and waking up so often during the night?"

Silver Linings Playbook is not good representation (In my opinion),33,mcn0w4,21,"I remember watching this before I was diagnosed coming away with a positive feeling. It was a fun heart-wrenching movie, right?

Problem is, I've been diagnosed now and I realize this movie is kinda just here to make fun of people with bipolar disorder, not understand us more.

First, the two bipolar characters act abnormally strange (in my opinion). It seems like they might have Aspergers or some other form of communicative issues outside of BP, which is fine, but if you don't mention that it feels like you're spreading one big paintbrush of bipolar people being incapable of either holding in their own thoughts/feelings and always being socially handicapped in conversations.

Second, seemingly only using episodes to highlight mania in which we are either sex-crazed maniacs or violent individuals who need the police/crowds of men to get involved because we are a threat to anyone who triggers us. Now, I'm not going to act like I haven't gone on a sexcapade or been irrationally angry because somebody might have pushed a trigger for me but only showing this and not really putting in too much effort to show we really are trying to control our emotions (not being able to really decipher whether we are being irrational or not) is just using our illness for a punchline. Also, using Dinero's character's supposed OCD as a punchline, guilting him for not being able to control his urges, and then basically saying he can pretty much get over it if someone just lays out all of the reasons why he is wrong in front of him....  

Lastly, where are the depressive episodes in this movie? Where are the mentions of suicidality, the inability to get up and jog that one morning, the difficulty eating or sleeping all day. You're telling me, two UNMEDICATED bipolar people are just able to show up to rehearsal all the time for months. No mention of Jennifer's character canceling rehearsal because she can't get out of bed, or maybe even calling the entire thing off because her depression is so bad. 

&#x200B;

Idk, I had to reflect and honestly, this movie thinks it's doing so much when really it (to me) is just making fun of us and asking us to laugh along."

Lamotrigine dosage,1,mcmk56,18,"Hello,

I’m looking for some feedback from others with bp2 that take lamotrigine. What dosage did you find to work best for you? I know it will vary for every individual but just looking for what dose has helped others. 

Im definitely hypo right now ( racing thoughts but not out of control, and hard time concentrating and remembering things short term, slightly irritable but not bad, talking more than normal) I’m currently taking 100mg/day. 75 at night and 25 in the morning. This is my only medication right now other than my blood pressure medication (verapamil) and klonopin as needed, but I literally take maybe .1mg-.5mg a day just to slow my brain down a bit when I need it.  I’m pretty sure this dose was keeping me somewhat stable... until I went out of town for a weekend and forgot my meds. That was about a week and a half ago. Not sure if those couple days threw me off completely but I tapered back up to my 100mg dose now. 

I also have a super stressful job in project management that I know is adding to it. And there’s no way for me to reduce my load at work right now so I just need to get through it. 

To cut to the point, I know I need to up my dose a bit. Thinking jump up to 150 and give it a shot (with my doctors guidance of course) What’s the best way to titrate up without having the temporary side effects (loss of coordination and cognitive ability etc.)

Thank you for any info I appreciate it."

I'm back.,24,mcjkwt,5,"I was SO impressed with the hospital this time around. The staff were friendly and polite. Also extremely accommodating and personable. Many shared their stories with me. I left feeling so so so much less alone. 

The staff understood the content, and used it, that they taught in groups. They gave practical advice, showing me *how* to make changes, not *what changes to make.* 

The dr was really friendly and took his time with me. And the therapist helped so much. (Plus he was hot, had great style and even greater shoes. And we have the same name.) 

Over the weekend, the weekend dr was SO hot. Or at least... he had a bouncin baseball booty! Lmao it kinda became a joke between me and a couple of the bros and staff. The therapist (who I thought was a tech when we discussed this), when he walked in made eye contact w me and I nodded saying yeah thats him and she quick glanced his butt and looked up at the clock. Then she looked at me and did that ""dayum"" face. It was really funny. 

Guys, I've been to this hospital more times than I can count. But this stay was just absolutely mind blowing. I'm so impressed. One tech expressed how much she will miss me and she didn't want me to leave because ""who was she gonna shoot the shit with?"" 

Also, a pt was carried out in cuffs. She was a nurse. She's facing assault on a youth care worker. That was exciting. 

One of the bros got me a cold washcloth with ice wrapped in it and put it on my neck while I had a heat flash and I didn't ask. He didn't ask if I wanted it. He just did it. It felt so nice to feel genuine care from someone I don't have any history with. I can't remember the last time I felt that. I'm crying thinking about it all.

Last night, me and another bro laughed in the hallway hysterically for 2 HOURS making fun of lil Wayne using ""lil Wayne voices.""

Between me being extremely happy to the point where if people say something ”too” negative i almost get angry and extreme emptiness where i feel like suicide is the only option.

We dated for almost three years(2017-2020), but in the last year (dec 2019) something triggered my bipolar disorder. After that i kept messing up the relationship in ways I couldn't have even imagined before this. In December 2019 I went to a psychiatrist and  started my meds. But after bearing with me for an year she finally broke up in march 2020, I tried to explain my diagnosis and just kept asking for some time but to no avail. Immediately after that lockdown started and i went from bad to worse.(I even tried to overdose myself with the meds)  ( banged my head on glass till it broke). Then I kept bothering her and got blocked everywhere. It has been a very rough year for me and just when I thought I started to get better, all these memories started flooding back to me since the past few weeks. I sometimes find myself randomly chanting her name. she's on my mind 24*7, even after 1 year.

hallucinations or genuinly actually people talking?,4,mcfjza,9,"I just moved to a lake with my mom and I am aving difficuty telling if I am having hallucinations or not when out on the deck having a pipe.

There mostly city people so they are incredable nose as to what I am used to (living in the middle of no where and everyone minding their own fucking bussness.)

I have had hallucinations that consistantly comment on what I am doing before, i go out to smoke some pipe around 1 time an our, the lake has a massive echo and the city people have not a fucking clue how far their voices carry... so there is that. Also it only occures outside. I never hear anything when i am in the house.

I just moved here like half a month ago so i guess there could just be nasty neighbours who are extremly judgmental cause i basicly do nothing all day ever day outside exept when i go out on the deck to smoke pipe. Also pipe smoking I find is more a country guys thing where i just sit outside and smoke pipe for as long as i want to... i guess there is no way to find out if i am hallucinating or if people here just dont know how to mind their own buissness.

I can’t really explain, I guess they just don’t understand and it’s so painful to me to not be able to have anyone to go to who understands and can help to cheer me up or something or just provide some comfort or something just anything to ease the pain a bit 

I just feel like such a huge burden and I can’t talk to anyone about how I feel without the conversation turning sour which then stresses me out even more so I just suffer alone and then everyone says why didn’t you speak to me about it or come to me

I went to the store to buy trainers and I fitted them, chose the color and everything. Then took a photo of them and said I'll be back. I sent the photo to a possible love interest to get them to tell me if it's okay to buy it.

Every time I want to spend money on something large I always get all my information together, a justification of why I need to purchase it and then ""pitch"" it to my parents. They basically decide if I'm ""eligible"" to purchase it.

Please can anyone give some tips or courses. Anything at this point. I'm desperate, I can't carry on like this."
Binge drinking since covid started,2,mcags2,6,"Anyone else had this problem? I’ve never been out of control until covid started. Maybe because I’m home all the time and it drives me crazy? Or that I’m working at home and don’t have accountability? Or I’m depressed because of covid? I’ll go on a 5 day binge almost monthly, then do fine for the other 25ish days. Heck, I will even drink during those 25 days and can easily stop after a light beer or two."
Last Night Me left This Morning Me a To-Do list,7,mca6s1,1,"Last night me had pretty high expectations for not knowing how we were going to wake up this morning. Got myself all pepped up writing down all the things I've accomplished so far this week, wanted to keep that momentum even with sleep tugging at me. 

Experiencing dread about starting a task not for what it actually entails, but for what comes later on down the line. I had some trouble Englishing this to my therapist. I can visualize myself doing the tast and everything it requires, but then I go past that.

One of the things on my list is to clean out one of my desk drawers. I can do that right here at my computer, no problem. I've got bins I got the other day specifically for sorting and a trash bag started from where I cleaned out two other drawers yesterday (I seriously can't believe it's 3/4 full already, just from desk trash). All the tools I need, right here.

But what's freaking me out is the thought that there's going to be a mishmosh box of stuff that doesn't really belong here or there, and I already got rid of the overlord of mishmosh stuff storage when we were preparing for the work we're going to do in the living room and nursery. 

I think maybe I've just gained a bit of sympathy for hoarders. I've lost me hoard."
New psychiatrist thinks I'm bipolar and wants to mess with my meds. Advice?,1,mca3lp,4,"My new psychiatrist thinks that I might be bipolar and wants to mess with my meds. Just looking for advice I guess. Something feels off and I want to seek a second opinion. 

ETA: I guess I meant is it worth it to seek another opinion because I'm already struggling with scheduling work/school/appointments or should I just wait and see how the meds help first?

My background: I was diagnosed as ADHD way back in elementary school and I've been on various meds for it for years. For about 8 months I've been on Vyvanse, Clonidine, and Prozac.  Sometimes I would have periods (usually weeks or even a month or two) where I felt like my ADHD was out of control, but I was mostly able to do my schoolwork and I was scared to mess with my meds in case my grades suffered. 

I got really depressed in December and I had no motivation to do my schoolwork and predictably my grades this semester dropped. The psychiatrist I'd been seeing for 2 years quit taking my insurance starting in 2021, so I looked for someone near my university. On my 3rd visit with this new guy, he said that he thinks that I'm bipolar.

This is the first time anyone has ever suggested that and I don't know what to think. He wants to replace Prozac with Lamotrigine and decrease my Vyvanse dosage. 

If it helps, I'm currently on Vyvans 60, Prozac 20, and Clonidine 0.3 and I turn 19 in May."
Obsessions when hypomanic,7,mc9zjk,10,"Does anyone else get obsessed over one particular thing when they're hypomanic? I watched a video on the most common signs for hypomania, and one of them was obsessing over certain things for days- or weeks- on end. After watching the video and reflecting a bit, I realized that, before my diagnosis, I'd obsess over certain things forever, and the obsessions would often be accompanied by high energy, euphoria, and impulsiveness. Back in December, I remember being super obsessed with cottagecore for weeks, along with feeling euphoric and having higher than usual energy. It got so bad that I dragged my friend with me to Goodwill to buy cottagecore themed clothes. I think I spent almost $50 in clothes and stuff that I didn't really need- I just felt the impulse to buy them for the aesthetic. At the time, I didn't think anything of it, but now that I'm reflecting on it, I realize that I was more than likely hypomanic during that time."

How has the pandemic affected your bipolar disorder?,3,mc9olu,7,"This has been a major year of growth for me. I didn't know I had bipolar disorder until it was confirmed this year, and I've been in treatment for an eating disorder. Last summer, I had a mixed episode, but in retrospect I think I may have been hypomanic leading up to it. I fell into a depressive episode that lasted months and then have cycled in and out of hypomania and depression a few times (especially during medication adjustments). Some days I accept that I have bipolar disorder and other days I feel like there is nothing wrong with me and it was all just in my head and I'm just a moody person. When I think back to times I may have been hypomanic, I realize its not that often and I am usually more depressed, but it seems like recently I have been cycling fairly rapidly and I'm wondering if thats due to the stress of the pandemic. Can anybody relate? How has the pandemic affected you?"
"New symptom popped up, time to address",13,mc8odj,9,"So I know I've been slightly manic for about 2 weeks now, but its that good, productive manic. The kind where you clean your house, do your car maintenence, catch up with friends, and other appointments you've been putting off. I rely on these times to get things done my otherwise agoraphobic leaning self wouldn't do.

 Well, this morning I noticed a new symptom. I HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS! I have answered every reddit post I have anything to say about, reached out to friends who need advice (or don't) about how to run their lives, and even told my therapist why I'm crushing life right now.

Yeah, time to address this. Anyone else sad when these times have to end?"
You are perfect as you are (recently diagnosed),19,mc8mj1,8,"Hey everybody, 3 weeks ago I was diagnosed bipolar 1. I’ve had 1 manic episode in my life (6 or so years ago) and mainly spend a majority of my time on the other side of the spectrum, in depression. It always hits me in the winter like a ton of bricks.

It’s hard because when I feel good, I feel great. Like nothing is going to bring me down ever again.

But prior to being diagnosed, I never gave much thought to the good times or why they might have felt so good. Perhaps hypomania because they are generally marked by extreme productivity and resilience.

Needless to say, after being diagnosed a few weeks ago, I started to question EVERYTHING about myself.

I started to hate myself for everything I might have done while happy and productive, even if it was positive. Because seen through the new lens of having something “wrong” with me, I lost trust in myself.

But today I had a moment of acceptance.

I accepted myself and I accepted the ups and downs.

They are me. And even if they disrupt “normal” life, there’s still a path forward for me (and a path for you) in life.

This thought gave me a bit of hope today, and hope is what we all need.

Anyone else out there going through something similar, I want you to know it’s not over. 

You have a purpose. You matter. And you are strong as hell.

If you’re going through a similar journey as me right now, I’d love to connect and support each other.

Feel free to reach out.

Much love,

"Questioning diagnosis, but does it matter since the meds are helping?",2,mc8fh3,9,Why: My dysphoric episodes always lasted days instead of weeks or months—and were always triggered by perceived abandonment in my personal relationships. I’ve been reading and think the dysphoric episodes are possibly part of a personality disorder rather than my diagnosis of Bipolar. My pdoc is convinced I’m Bipolar because of the major impulsivity I had. I haven’t had an episode since I started the mood stabilizer....Is it even worth bringing up/trying to convince her since the meds are working?

Tapering marijuana consumption after break up,1,mc8e91,3,"(M25)Was broken up with yesterday shortly after declaring my love to the person(F25). The reason for the break up was my mood changes and how they effected her. Had no interest in smoking my normal weed. For quite sometime it has been making some symptoms of my BD a lot worse in the beginning and then slowly I mellow out into something I could describe as just keeping my head above water. But weed is the only way I can sleep. Even then I'm just trying to distract myself until I eventually KO. I’m not on any prescribed medication. If I’m being quite honest, I haven’t gone a day without smoking in probably 7 years. I know it’s not good. But I’m terrified to stop and have an episode, lose my job, lose my truck because I can’t pay it off, be sent back in life etc. In less than a year, I will no longer be on my parents healthcare plan and I’m slowly spiraling thinking about how I’m supposed to support myself when I don’t think I can keep it together forever and will eventually end up in a psych ward only to then be left on the street like so many people I see living in the LA area. What scares me the most about seeing someone on the corner talking to themselves is that I, in some strange way, understand and can see myself in that same state. Back to Mary Jane. I have been exclusively using a 1:1 cbd/thc vape for the past 2 days now. I've noticed a lot of my symptoms have started to ease a bit. It has been harder to fall asleep though. I really want to stop smoking all together. I am really thinking about scheduling an appointment with a psychiatrist. It's been a long time since I have felt truly happy with my life. Like on the surface everything is fine, but deep down I am so lonely and sad and feel like I'm drowning every day.

Does anyone on here use mood trackers? I think it might help just to see what a ""normal"" month looks like. 

If you read this, thanks for listening. Sorry for the rant. Probably won't be my last."

"I just started therapy, and I’m terrified for my diagnostic questions",3,mc7qqx,3,"Hi everyone...I’m kind of alone right now and am probably at one of the lowest parts of my life right now. But, I would like to give some background about me. 

I have really, really really bad anger problems, and sometimes it’s hard for me to feel empathy whenever I’m arguing with someone. It’s so bad that sometimes I don’t even have to have a reason to get angry, I just do. It’s so exhausting dealing with this because I could be doing nothing, and it just hits me. It’s like actually feeling the anger enter your body, and I feel it start in my chest. I become numb, and that’s when I shut down and just let it take over me. When that happens, I have no control and I try to hurt people with my words. I hate it. I hate myself. 

However, recently I’ve become violent. So much so I hurt 2 of the most important people in my life, my mom, and my girlfriend. I knew I needed help after an incident with my mom that led me to getting kicked out of her house. I started therapy 4 days ago, and I’m going through my questions, but today, I take a behavioral test to see if I have any issues up there. 

Truth is, I’m terrified to see what happens. My cousin, who I’m fairly close with, has bipolar disorder, and I’ve seen what happens during an episode. When I was younger it always scared me, and I didn’t want to be near her. I don’t want that to be me. But I know something is wrong, and it’s more than just “controlling my anger” now

I may not belong here, but, I hope that I can in the future. Until then, I wish everyone here happy healing, and nothing but good times :)"
Doubting my diagnosis.,1,mc7q87,3,"I had a manic episode 3 years ago that put me in the hospital. At the time of the manic episode I was coming off risperidone which I was put on unnecessarily due to a misdiagnosis for a different issue. Ever since my stay at the hospital I've been taking lithium and a antipsychotic (olanzapine at first, then loxapine). Here is the issue during the period where I ended up in the hospital I was manic and hypomanic for 2 months but prior to these 2 months I have never experienced a manic or hypomanic state nor for the 3 years after. I have never experienced a depressive state like people describe on this forum either. I had depression when I was younger but it wasn't cyclical.

I know coming off risperidone can induce mania. The point is can you have had a manic episode without being bipolar?"

I feel like a completely different human when I gym in the morning,0,mc7own,2,"I made a post just last night when I was freaking out in hypomania. I've been off my usual gym schedule for about 2 weeks after my sleep schedule got thrown off by something stupid. But this morning, I got up close to my desired time, had a class I had to go to but instead decided I was going to go to the gym since I knew I wouldn't be able to be productive and focus. Usually, I get up earlier and gym before class, but I'm getting back into the swing again, so had to choose one.

Oh my god, I feel like.... a completely different person. My mind is calm, I can focus, I'm not dealing with this weird IDGAF feeling..... ya'll need to try this. I didn't realize how effective it was until experiencing hypomania just the night before. This just reinforces my hope that there is a way to control BD symptoms without meds. I believe building *habits* like this that increase good brain chemistry is my way to go about controlling my symptoms. I will update with how I feel as the day/week goes along."
I am so tired of being identified as bipolar like it is the most identifiable characteristic I have. Anyone else feel this way?,3,mc7o1a,10,"I honestly wish their wasn’t this descriptor, people seem unable to separate the individual from their idea of bipolar once they get connected.

I feel like calling me Bipolar is like saying I have long fingernails or brown hair, it’s just a trait, not my name or who I am. Other people identify me as bipolar more than I do myself. 

I wish I had never told anyone, it completely changes their perception of me, my accomplishments, and my abilities. I am tired of being told I am broken, less than, or doing a good job despite my issues.

Not being bipolar is no more normal than not having blonde hair. I’m tired of everyone assuming they are better just because they don’t have my specific issue.

Everyone’s struggle is a 10/10, we just all have different tens. I’m tired of my struggle being the main thing people see. It clouds everything else I am and makes me sad.

"I was researching different ""mental health"" conditions, and I'm confused-",1,mc6kgo,7,"I wanted a definition for each condition that was being talked about on Twitter today but I came away more confused.

*Autism: developmental disability. Alright, since it onsets in childhood, I guess that makes sense.


*ADHD: Mental Health Disorder. Nope, I'm confused. ADHD and Autism have so much overlap they're considering moving them onto the same spectrum. Since ADHD often starts in childhood too, why is it not considered the same way as Autism as a developmental disability?


*Bipolar: Mental Illness. WHAT?? How is this an illness? There's no cure for the way we are. I don't know if I was born this way or if I developed this as a tween or teen but all of these terms are confusing.


*Schizophrenia: Mental disorder. We come to yet another term even though I've heard bipolar and schizophrenia have some overlap/shared symptoms.

How do you cope with first realizing you're bipolar,5,mc6i54,5,"I just had the first manic episode of my life from 20 mg of Prozac and now after it cooled down and I destroyed my relationship it's kind of mind numbing realizing I'm bipolar.

I find solace in being able to be like ""wow that's why I've been a depressed shut in for a year then filled with energy and ambition then a depressed shut in again"". Though, it really sucks knowing all of my problems were because of a disorder I didn't choose to have thanks to genetics. And now my gf hates me. 

My sister is schizoaffective, and my mom I'm pretty sure is undiagnosed schizoaffective. There's also the latent fear of progressing to their point aswell in the future. I've always had a fear of being schizophrenic because I have a cousin who is and then my sister and mom, and I've been wrestling with delusions and psychosis during my extremes in moods too.

How do you guys focus when you are sleep-deprived and scattered? Any tips or help would be appreciated.

Update: Asked my teacher for an extension, he was super understanding. I have some time to chill before starting the essay. Also my situation was not as dire as I thought it was, I was just panicking. I have plenty of time for my other assignments, and I'm allowed to take a break.

My friend is falling into a very depressive state during a med change, she's very much in a ""I would like to not exist for a while"" sort of mindset.  One of the things she talked about the other day was how much she misses things like reading, and math. Things I would very much like to do with her.  She's also being emotionally neglected by those close to her (she lives a distance away) and has commented on wanting to hang out with people (with a strong implication of IRL people).

I want to encourage her in this, her resilience is one of my favourite traits in her. But she's slipping into a dark place, and I'm trying not to be pushy.

i dont see a lot of bipolar people becoming academically up there? does that sentence make sense. i think also since theres still a taboo where it isnt talked about. but i wanna work through it yaknow, i dont want my mental ilness to hinder my own potential. ive gotten conditional offers already, for now its about the grades.

and sometimes when i study i tend to get flashes of people who left? but yaknow i dont want to study in spite of people, i want to be indifferent, and study for myself, and for me, not to spitefully prove things to people. pushing away the thoughts has been a constant effort really. aaaaaaaaaaaaa

The next day I went outside and walked to a nearby restaurant. Could barely eat anything because when I’m manic I have almost no appetite but I felt amazing and was in the best mood I’ve been in in months.


Suddenly I’m texting all my friends I’ve been ghosting and trying to make plans. Then I’m staying up all night watching reality tv, completely redoing my entire island in animal crossing, painting, and uncontrollably buying a shit ton of stuff online.

No crying thank god! Now, literally I’m super energetic even when tired like right now. Like literally want to run a marathon and sleep at the same time. Wtf is happening?!

trying to do this without meds,2,mbyarq,2,"I'm against using meds to treat my BD, but I'm starting to run low on options and the stakes are only going to increase for me. I'm grateful that I don't work a regular job and that my boss is understanding, but I do need to maintain a certain status quo and I also work with other people and need to take that into consideration. 

Right now, I'm in a hypomanic point. I can't sleep and I have some energy to do tasks, but I lack interest in doing anything important or meaningful and have had that condition for a long time. That's what drives me crazy. I mean, I have *a ton* of motivation and interesting ideas, but it's like the energy is zapped from my body as soon as I sit down to engage with them. I wonder sometimes if I'm truly bipolar or just clinically depressed. 

I've had some luck with finding stability by keeping a strict schedule, but after 5 pm, I'm still left to my own devices and I learned that a schedule isn't enough to control my swings. Any free time at my disposal is spent feeling down and out. Getting laid has convinced me that I need more pleasure in my life and that it would solve my problems, but in reality, it knocks me off my already precarious sleep schedule and introduces new problems to the mix, like a general IDGAF attitude that I can't afford to have rn. 

I always feel behind because of BD, like I'm making up for lost time my entire life. I think it's because I am so easily distracted from my goals. A lot of the time, they're too painful to engage with (I get confused about why I don't enjoy these activities anymore that I worked so hard to be able to do), and go and acquire supplies or training for a new hobby to add to my revolving door of skills. Besides my job, which I thought I was super passionate about and would easily focus on, I had one other long-term career path that I quit on because I just couldn't do it anymore, because of the lack of enjoyment. I just counted how many hobbies I have considered or picked up besides these two main passions over the years and there are at least 10 of them (probably more like 15). I've invested huge amounts of time and money on them and then had to backtrack, sell things, and ultimately replaced one hobby with another. I'm terrified of becoming a jack of all trades and a master of none, especially with my job.  

I've been isolated for a long time because of my upbringing and because of BD. That would be the most painful thing stopping me now. Making friends was so hard for me in college that I just dated people instead and became dependent on my partners for emotional support. Now I don't do that, but I was really desperate and was clinging to an ex of mine until about a week ago when I decided I'd trade one evil for another. I started being physical with a friend who I've fucked before, just so I don't think about my ex and can move on somehow. I really don't feel ready to date anybody, we're just intimate, but it only takes the pain away temporarily. 

I'm wondering what I'm going to do now. Right now, I decided to try to sleep after this, finally tuckered out. But as for how I'm going to break out of this groundhog day cycle of feeling shitty, I feel like there's gotta be an answer out there that doesn't involve meds, but that I haven't found it yet. I think it has something to do with maintaining a schedule and getting love and affection, but I have no idea how to engage successfully with activities or how to develop a focus on only a few key interests."

Thinking about Hospitalization,2,mbxojz,6,"I (F20) have been thinking about hospitalizing myself for a couple months now but I've never been hospitalized and I'm kind of scared. I've struggled with mental illness since I was little but its seen as taboo in my family so the only way I would be hospitalized is if I admit myself. I've been getting pretty bad lately with extreme depressive episodes, and issues with self harm. I have always had suicidal ideation but its been plaguing my mind recently. I don't have any plans or anything like that though. 

I do see my psychiatrist monthly but he's been on vacation and I haven't seen him for 2 months now, I can feel my depression getting worse. 

Is hospitalization something I would possibly benefit from? I've never met someone with Bipolar who has benefitted from it so I'm kind of nervous and unsure. I guess I just need advice on what I should do. If possible what do you guys recommend so I can avoid hospitalization. Thanks in advance! 

If possible, please share your experience being in the hospital while in a depressive episode :)"

"Doing insta cart in boulder, this whole thing is messing with me",1,mbwk5f,3,I moved to Boulder in January from NJ. I was driving for insta cart to pay my rent and was at the store ten minutes before the shooting. I was going to take another order there but a better one popped up closer to my place and I was getting ready for lunch. I drove past the swat trucks going in the opposite direction. I feel so bad for the people. I feel really shook up and off. It doesn’t feel safe anywhere anymore. To add insult to injury the shooter was on antipsychotics and That just makes me think about it even more. I just needed to get all that out
Weed and Bipolar Disorder,7,mbw9ry,15,"Hi all. I (33 M) love smoking the herb and have done so regularly for many years. It’s always been a recreational habit but I’ve found that I have been using for medicinal purposes like anxiety and depression. 

I was wondering and wanted to ask you all about your thoughts and views on marijuana usage with people who have bipolar disorder. Do you think it’s safe? Do you think that it could benefit those with bipolar disorder?"
No longer aware of episodes,11,mbvf48,14,"I'm lucky, in a way. I have resolved my underlying issues. I no longer crave alcohol or drugs. I have been holding down a full time job for the past 3 years and I have interviews upcoming for better jobs. I am also mostly stable outside of triggers.

Or so I thought. I'm having periods where I'm more sociable than normal and more irritable at the slightest things. Then I have periods where I'm normal and who I really am. Sometimes I feel empty inside. It's like my bipolar has been downgraded but now I'm no longer aware of the shift until a long time after the new episode starts. I used to recognise them when they were extreme but now I don't as much. I'm not sure what to do."

Thinking about hospitalization,3,mbuvic,4,"When I’ve gone to the hospital in the past, it’s been in the mental health unit that’s like 3 blocks from my house. It’s a program that is generally 3-5 days. I’ve done it 17 times. 

One time I went to immanuel in Omaha. I liked parts of it better. Mostly because I have many chronic conditions that need to be managed, and the other hospital doesn’t have a doctor check your physical health or anything. Immanuel does. 

But what I’d like is maybe a hospital with a longer program maybe where I could stay like a couple weeks. And where doctors check your physical health, not just the five-minute psychiatric visits where everyone gets lamictal even if you insist it doesn’t work for you. 

I would drive somewhere in the Midwest. Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota? Maybe even Colorado? Minneapolis?  I just need proper help."
My Poor Innocent Wife,2,mbu1sn,16,"So...

We were on vacation with two other couples, drunk and having fun when someone suggested to go to a strip club. My wife has never been to a strip club before but actually agrees to go! My manic self is screaming inside - ""YEAH!!!!!"". I excuse myself to an ATM where she can't see me and withdraw the $500 limit.

We go to the club and are tossing cash at the strippers when my wife says, ""you should get a dance"". HELL YEAH I SHOULD!!! But I she doesn't know about the magic curtain. So as I disappear... She waited right outside while I order drinks, order service and compensated the help well. What a night!

So the really bad part of this was - we were celebrating our wedding anniversary...

Of course the manic episode wore off and the guilt sets in. Oops!"

I honestly just need to rant,4,mbtn7m,3,"I am watching myself lose my mind gradually and it scares the shit out of me. I’m still in college, so am living at home with my parents this year. I struggled with moderate depression throughout high school, and they acknowledged that. However, the past year of my life I have made horrible, reckless decisions, which landed me in the position of getting a psych  evaluation late last year. Bipolar. Parents were in denial. 3 opinions later, and *drumroll*... bipolar. They are finally starting to come to terms with it, but I keep getting worse. I’ve tried all of the meds that my body can tolerate (I have a serious hypersensitivity to all meds, so am severely limited in what I can take), and all have made me feel so much worse. My psychiatrist decided to take me off the meds, as the last one caused me to rapid cycle and to have insane suicidal ideation. We are trying an intensive therapy and supplement/diet based treatment plan, but I just keep getting worse. Never had psychotic symptoms before, but I’m manic this week and am convinced my psychiatrist wants me to get worse, and that my parents are in on it. I was having a breakdown earlier and my dog came into my room, but I shooed her out because I was convinced that my parents bugged her in order to record my meltdown so they could have me  involuntarily committed. Haven’t slept in 40 hours, and none of my sleep medications are effective. I’ve been losing it all week in regards to anger. I’m exploding at anyone who dare question my judgement, and at people I love because of how they’ll never understand what I’m going through, since the bipolar emotional spectrum is so much different than how an average brain functions. I just feel so trapped. I’m terrified of hospitals, and all these fears keep getting worse as I descend farther into my mania. I’ve been so social all week and I already know I’ll regret it as soon as the depression hits, as I overextended myself again. The only thing that sounds good right now is to just run away from everything. I have an excellent medical care team and I am truly doing the best I can. It just hurts to see how much damage I am still doing to my family."
Seroquel Tapering,3,mbtmmz,7,"I am tapering my Seroquel with psychs knowledge. I have been on 600mg for about 9 months, but this is the dosage I was put on while in crisis A.K.A severe mixed state that landed me  in inpatient. So psych is reducing me by 100 mg every 4 days. I am now down to 400mg and will be at 300mg before I see her again. I’m not sleeping, but my energy level is up and I am feeling very confident, empowered, and alive. It feels like I had been walking around in a haze and all the fog has lifted. Am I tapering down too fast? Could this be the beginning of a manic episode? This is one the main things I hate about bipolar, you can never trust your own feelings, your always second guessing. Any feedback or thoughts are welcomed!"

I want to run away,10,mbrvy3,6,"I’m 20 going on 21 and currently work in a grocery store. I can’t even afford the company health insurance I’m offered cause I make too little. I’m still on my grandparent’s insurance but I’ve got about 4 years to figure out a career that’ll pay for the insurance for the meds I’m going to need for the rest of my life. I’ve had issues sticking with meds in the past but I’m making an effort to actually put in the work and take care of myself mentally. I’ve had several moments of hypo mania in the fast few days, to the point I’ve hallucinated, had trouble sleeping, and have been bouncing up and down with excitement at times. I can feel myself escalating and I don’t know if I’m BP 1 or 2 because I’ve stayed away from psychs and therapists so I haven’t had a manic episode diagnosed for sure. I have this growing urge to just run away and not have to deal with all the stress and responsibility on my shoulders. Just get in my car and drive as far as I can and not tell anyone where I’m going. I for some reason want to go to the woods. Just get a sleeping bag and sleep in the woods by myself with no thought to what would happen. I’m losing touch with my conscious and I don’t really care much what would happen to me or if I’d worry others. My job is becoming less important to me and I’ve already been fired from my last job cause I went off on everyone. I can’t mess up this job I’ve had it for 2 and a half years now but I’m losing control. I don’t see my psych for another week. Help."

Also that insomnia causes me to be wide aware and leads up to hypomania that I don't want to escalate into full on mania"
Why do I want to die?,6,mbr5m4,10,"I’m fairly new to this sub and being someone with bipolar. I was diagnosed as bipolar I just a couple weeks ago. I drank today and I can’t help but feel as though I want to commit suicide. I know how it’ll affect my family but I just can’t do it anymore. I’m a complete fucking failure. Back in January I cheated on the love of my life with my manipulative ex in what was apparently a manic episode (I also almost died multiple times from my own actions and almost got arrested for a DUI in this time period). It consumes me on a near minutely basis. We’re repairing our relationship but I have to face the scorn of being a dirty fucking cheater and being a pathetic excuse of a human being. I shouldn’t live. Her friends call me a pathetic excuse for a human being. Maybe I am. Some of them wish me dead, they don’t understand that I want that too. Every single one of her friends has been telling her that “once a cheater always a cheater”. I’m not a cheater, I’m not a bad person, but I’ll never escape that reputation so what’s holding me back from killing myself if the world believes I’m some sort of evil and cruel person. She knows that I’m bipolar, I told her, but her friends don’t, so having people come up to me and being like “so you’re the person who cheated on [not going to disclose name for privacy reasons]” and smirking at me like they’re so far above me when I don’t answer the question because I’m fucking ashamed of myself makes me even more inclined just to kill myself. They’d fucking celebrate it. A lot of people would. I mean I’m failing all my classes in college, I hurt one of the only people I love more than anything else in ways I cannot even imagine, and I’m just not good at anything. I just don’t see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore, I just want to be gone because that’s one of the only positive actions I could ever do. I can’t live with myself with that guilt, knowing I destroyed someone’s entire fucking world just because I was drunk and manic and did that, I can’t fucking live with that"

What's the best clinic or treatment center in the world?,3,mbmjse,5,"Ok, so I'm becoming desperate. My illness seems to be so complex, not just a regular bipolar. I've got a kind of mild anhedonia, OCD, some symptoms from the schizoid/schizotypal spectrum, maybe a little autistic too. Cognitive decline, memory loss, emotional numbness... I just can't accept this. I was never okay but everything got much worse after my first mania.

My question is... Is there any place in the world where I can find like real help? Not just a regular psychiatrist who would prescribe me some drugs within 20 minutes. I am fantasizing about a place where I could undergo several in-depth tests to discover what the fuck went wrong in my brain and CNS... I know it probably does not exist. But.. Geeeez. This is a terrible fate."
Just a rant,2,mbm18n,4,"This is just a dumb rant and I think people are tired of me talking about my mental health but, 
This week has been weird. I had racing thoughts on Friday. I really wanted to stay up but, I knew it wouldn’t be good for me. The things is, I don’t even remember if I slept or not. I had a really nice feeling of well being on Saturday, but at night I became very anxious and had rapid thoughts again. It was almost physically painful. Sunday, I woke up extremely motivated and had a really happy feeling that gave me motivation. I called different friends and talked a lot more than usual. I cleaned and cleaned, did all my missing work and just felt great honestly. I didn’t sleep that day, went to school feeling extremely irritated. I really didn’t want to sleep, but I felt so tired that I just slept for like 5 hours. I woke up and had rapid suicidal thoughts. I was extremely irritated and angry to the point where I was almost in despair. I forced myself to take my medicine and the medicine calmed me down but suddenly I decided to call someone and I talked a lot until like 2 am. I couldn’t even get up in the morning. The medicine gives me a very empty bleh feeling but I get a little bit of a happy rush still. I’ve felt pretty irritated and I want to do something impulsive and not just stay still. I hate how my medicine makes me feel so boring. When I have rapid thoughts I scold myself and tell myself to stop because I think that I’m faking it, but it doesn’t stop. These rapid thoughts aren’t super constant but they come back through out the day and so do my little rushes of happiness. It’s anger and irritation mostly. I don’t think I’m having a manic episode. This doesn’t seem as severe as my other ones so I really doubt myself. I would doubt myself and then go into full blown mania, so I’m just really confused.

I don’t really think it’s depression since I’m getting so much done and I feel pretty and confident, but as soon as I don’t feel as attractive I become extremely angry rather than sad

This is really embarrassing to talk about to other people, sorry this is so long"
"Jest left the doctor, now I am feeling absolutely hopeless.",13,mblyq1,16,"I was on medication for a while. It worked okay, I was definitely better than beforehand, but I was not completely stable either. 

I began taking depo (birth control shot), and my mental health plummeted. Also have physical concerns and issues with it, but I mostly worried about the mental issues. 

Anyways, I assumed it was a clash of the hormones and medication. Quit my meds temporarily until I was able to get in with a gynecologist for a consultation about the Paraguard (nonhormonal IUD) and set all of that up to get one. Turns out that I cannot get that, or any other IUD actually.

My only option is either stay on depo, or get the nexplanon (arm implant). Same side effects, so really no point in paying for the nexplanon when I can just continue to get the shot for free at the health department. 

I just feel so hopeless. I am physically miserable due to side effects, insecure from the weight gain, and severely depressed. Hearing this today was a huge slap in face. I completely lost it and cried my eyes out when I got into my car. 

I cannot stop the birth control. I am in a long term relationship, and I just know we couldn’t abstain no matter how hard we tried. I cannot risk getting pregnant due to us both being college students. That would make everything about 10000 times worse for me. So I feel like I’m just stuck being this way. 

I am going to call my psychiatrist, talk to her about everything that the gynecologist said, and get back on medication. I just feel like it won’t help anything due to these hormones themselves messing me up so bad mentally. 

Sorry for the long post, but this devastated me and I needed to let it out. I was dead set on this. I was dead set on getting better. Now I just feel like it’ll never happen."
Perspective,27,mblrel,4,
I'm very jealous of people who don't suffer from bipolar disorder..,93,mbll9t,18,"I have friends who don't know about my diagnosis, my meds, my therapy.. They're so full of life, and when I'm at my lowest (the depressive episodes) they don't understand, so they automatically leave me alone because I shut down and I keep everyone afar, so they make plans without me, they laugh, live, joke around, hang out, and I can't do any of these things, I can't.

Things to do,2,mbkrrc,5,"I stumbled upon a podcast about bipolar and found interesting things that I wanted to share.

A. Track your moods for two months each day, and maintain a journal. ( go wild if you want )

B. Track your food intake in brackets and how they make you feel (bloated / happy / sad / full / empty) and water consumption.

C. Chart your Basic activity 1) sleep and 2) physical activity.

And they were exploring the relationship between food and bipolar. While other behaviours have been studied in context to bipolar. They are going to help us more. Let’s see how it goes. 

1. Don’t try meditation and other inward journeys.
2. Include magnesium (average is 200mg per day) and pyridoxine - b6 ( average is 40mg per day) in your diet. 
3. Be in touch with your therapist. 

I hope all of you are doing well. X"

Getting on meds so I can finally finish my degree,4,mbka3w,6,"I was extremely manic after my mom passed 4 years ago.

Well the mania subsided and I crashed and burned about a year later. I had one class left for my associates and I haven’t gone back. 

I have been prescribed Seroquel, starting it today. I registered for summer semester, and I’m going to apply at the university to start my bachelors in the fall. Here’s to getting my life, hopefully, back on track. I could use all the good vibes and suggestions as I’ve always quit meds about 2 weeks in."

Leaving me to go through the painstaking process of unexpectedly having to find a new one. I absolutely loved my new one. She is part of the reason I was okay taking the meds I am. She gave me the power to increase or decrease my meds (after talking to her of course). She made me feel like my mental health care was actually in my own hands and she was just there to facilitate the process. The process of finding a psychiatrist I actually liked was part of the reason I put it off for so long. I just feel fucking defeated.

Does it get better?,6,mbgbio,10,"Hello all.  I have been on Latuda for my Bipolar for a little while now. I am up to 80 mg. I also take Ritalin along with other vitamins and supplements. I feel like my mania is gone but I’m left with the depression. There aren’t “normal” days. Just down or downer days lol I make myself exercise but I am not consistent about it. I do better some weeks more than others. But I am so tired, I have to force myself when I do it because I feel so worn out. Plus I am a female, 36, with PCOS, and I am having some hormone issues. That probably doesn’t help.  I am grateful for what I have- doing good in other areas on my life but I feel a deep dread feeling, like deep sadness I can’t shake. I’ve always felt something like this on some days for as long as I can remember but now it’s all the time. It’s very hard for me to feel actual enjoyment.. if I do, it’s short lived. I hate it. I try to overall be a positive thinking person but I am struggling these days. I am thinking about getting off the Latuda. I also have lost my inspiration since being on it. I have tried many other things to treat the bipolar but I always have side effects that I can’t handle and I get off the mend. Any helpful tips or advice? Does it get worse before it gets better? Any Latuda users???  

Maybe I am someone who doesn’t respond well to medications. Maybe with therapy, which I am already in, and a good support system, I would be ok. I can’t keep feeling like this. I am not normally someone who reaches out for help but I really am desperate for some other feedback. Anything at all is appreciated. Thanks in advance."

And I'd come to, gargling in my own blood, complete darkness because my vision wouldn't make it. Unable to do anything but lay and think about how I knew this would happen. 

I'd be blind, mute, disfigured, a giant weight on everyone around me...but my mind would stay perfectly in tact and I'd just be trapped there.

That fear and knowing has prevented me from attempting any form of suicide, but I really would like to be proven wrong. 

I've begun hinting around to people I know that have done violent things in the past, trying to secure my own hitman. Maybe the surprise factor will help take me down.

Doctor told me to stop taking Lamictal after bad blood test.,3,mbfed5,8,"Hey guys, I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was started on lamictal which has really been helping me.

I’m not sure how long it takes for them to leave my system but I feel really hopeless right now.

I feel like it’s time to go inpatient,2,mbe55p,8,"I haven’t thought about anything but ending my life for the past two days. I keep googling most lethal ways to kill yourself (turns out a good amount of people survive a gun to the head, so that’s off my list). A few hours ago I was in my kitchen playing with the knifes, but they’re too dull to get the job done. For the past month I’ve been spiraling down this dark hole, and at this point it feels like I’m just waiting to muster up the courage to finally do the deed. I have such a strange feeling about me, like I’m living the last few days of my life. Call it intuition, maybe? Like my mind and body knows that the only way out is suicide, and that day is approaching. 

I haven’t showered in who knows how long. Haven’t brushed my teeth or my hair. I’m sleeping odd hours. I eat maybe half a meal a day.

The only thing holding me back from ending it is knowing my mom wouldn’t be able to handle losing another child. We lost my brother many years ago. I think if I killed myself, it would break my mom beyond repair. But what’s scaring me is that I’m starting to not care. 

I can recognize that I need help. I’ve been hospitalized when I was a teenager, so this is familiar to me. What’s really stopping me from going through with going inpatient are two things. 

1. Part of me wants to just go through with ending my life, and hospitalization seems “counterproductive” so to speak. I know that sounds stupid, but the illness is really starting to take over. Hospitalization just seems like an obstacle between me and my finish line, death. Not only that, but it just seems like such a hassle. And expensive. 

2. My dad. The last time I was hospitalized, he stormed up to me, as I lay on a gurney in the middle of a busy hospital, as began to berate me. He told me I was selfish, and that I was horrible for doing this to my mom, and that she was a wreck because of me. There have been many incidents like that, where my illness comes to light and my dad actually has to face it instead of ignoring it. He just gets so angry, and personalizes the symptoms of my illness as an attack on him. I’m so scared of this happening again. I’d honestly rather be dead. 

I don’t know what I hope to get from posting this. Support? Advice? Simply a place to release? I’m not sure. All I know is that the next step for me is either hospitalization or death. Not to be dramatic lmao."

Is my BP1 really this chronic?,2,mbb6rp,6,"I’ve asked this before. 

I posted earlier today, but I’m having another manic episode right now, as I was so closely approaching six months episode free, the longest I’ve ever gone since this ever started. 

Basically, I want to ask again for an update, how bad my BP1 is compared to others. I am also diagnosed with combined type ADHD. Oh also, I’m only 21. Male. 

I’ve had what seems like a really high number of episodes for the short period of time this disorder set on.  

Summer 2019— depressive episode 
Fall/Winter 2019— manic and psychotic 
Winter/Spring 2020— very overmedicated 
Spring/Summer 2020— depressed 
Summer/Fall 2020— hypomanic 

The only time I’ve ever been hospitalized was during the psychotic episode, which I’m absolutely positive was induced by a Zoloft prescription from my horrible doctor. 

But these episodes keep coming!!!!

I’ve tried so many different meds already. Wellbutrin 300mg, Zoloft 25mg (manic and psychotic), Risperdal 2.5mg (overmedicated and massive weight gain), Abilify (akathisia)

Currently on 
Vraylar 4.5mg
Lamictal 300mg 
Vyvanse 40mg 

And as needed 
Seroquel (hate it— too groggy)
Klonopin (my mom hides it from me but it works) 
Adderall IR 15mg (I take it a lot)

I also sometimes take Atarax. I’m supposed to take it daily but I just don’t and haven’t in a while. It only really is necessary sometimes. 

Then, I have terrible substance abuse problems. I have bad problems on and off with alcohol and weed. I have abused Adderall. I have done cocaine and would do it more if I had access, probably. I intentionally overload on caffeine. 

I’m like a textbook case Bipolar patient, and I have a feeling it’s like really chronic. I talk to other young people about their meds and their episodes and I seem so much more severe than them.

Someone please tell me honesty. How bad is my case? Like, how often do I need to plan on being hospitalized? I need to like, plan my life around this! 

I’m only 21 years old and I really want to live a happy and healthy life but this disorder is so debilitating and nobody understands. I feel so so alone."

"Long suspected, recently diagnosed.",1,mb8awm,2,"tw - self harm/substance abuse; hope this isn't too rambly and is the right sub/flair to share and ask for help.

Like the title says, I recently got a bipolar II diagnosis (this morning), though I've always sort of known that would be the case. Doc also says she suspects borderline personality disorder and ADHD though I'll need more time with her and a psychologist to definitively say. I can't express how much of a relief this is to hear.

My old psychiatrist of many years vehemently denied any diagnosis for me, even depression or anxiety disorder. His reasoning for denying my bipolar was that I wasn't hyper delusional when I was manic, i.e. didn't jump off a roof cause I thought I could fly. I have spent so many years feeling helpless and incredibly worthless, like there was no reason I couldn't live like other people other than I just wasn't trying hard enough. I feel so relived to know the truth, but also so twisted up from the years of believing I was 'crazy' and broken.

I got meds today (mood stabilizers instead of SSRIs for the first time, yay!!) and I'm wondering if anyone has advice on how to stay 'on track' with my healing. I know taking meds every day has always been an internal struggle for me; so has self acceptance when I have outbursts/episodes/tantrums. Substance abuse and self harm have also been a huge problem for me; I chose weed over my SRRIs when they weren't working (In NA and sober though!). I recently admitted to myself that I have a problem with lying to my romantic partners about mundane things due to shame. I'm embarrassed at the amount of sexual partners I've had at my age, not because it's a particularly high number, but because I've always felt like it never was 'me' who made those decisions.

How can I preserve my self image with this new diagnosis without using it as an excuse for my bad behavior? Any tips on staying on meds? Any books or other informational outlets that help you understand yourself and your disorder better? Words of encouragement?

Thanks for reading. <3"
being manic like,18,mlq0av,3,
Mixed episodes and denying the intensity of your feelings.,3,mlpzxq,1,"Not sure where to start so I will pick here. Right now I feel like letting every manic urge I'm feeling just fucking run wild. Most of that was drinking, lots of meaningless sex with random girls, spending money I don't have, drugs, starting 15 new projects at once.

Slight TL;DR: Took psych evals and they didn't show up as bipolar. My brain constantly thinks things like ""hey you can't be that depressed because other people are more depressed and kill themselves"". So I answer slightly depressed. These evals were after I went to the ER so I didn't kill myself. 

Now onto my story/problem.. I was reading and something said to not compare yourself to others in regards to things in life because your feelings only need to be validated by how they make you feel. I may be poor compared to someone like those three richest guys but that doesn't matter. I make decent money and am shit at budgeting. I feel poor because I have more than enough and I can't make it work properly. I feel anxiety really bad, I'm sweating having trouble breathing or functioning. I must not have that bad anxiety because others have panic attacks. Instead I decided to realize that I'm having literal panic attacks and downplaying it to my psychologist and psychiatrist. I've decided to let myself feel those feelings and compare them to my center.

So far it's been fucking brutal. I spent decades pretending I could bottle my feelings and I could fix my mental issues alone. Self medicating with alcohol doesn't work because my demons can swim. My psychologist said that I'm what they call ""flat"" and that my outward emotional expression is really hard to read and mostly neutral. The only time he said there is a change is when we talk about something I'm interested in and I seem slightly excited. It also turns out that most people don't get asked if they are autistic in their lives. Ive been asked several times. High processing speed and emotionless has gotten me called a robot by people close to me.

So far I've been diagnosed with adhd, bi-polar, not bi-polar, GAD, PTSD, not PTSD, persistive depressive disorder severe with anxious distress, and the Doc at the mental hospital also had an opinion but I can't remember. I spent a week at the mental and felt like the doctors didn't take me seriously because of my ""flat"" personality and my comparison to others rather than to myself.

I answered honestly to my psychiatrist on the intake and she takes me seriously in a way the others don't. She said I presented with bipolar. My SO also said I might be bipolar. I talked to my psychologist and explained how I didn't feel I was as honest as I could have been. I explained some of my behaviors that have been happening since I was a kid. He is on my team now. I picked him as a psychologist because he is dry like I am and he doesn't let me walk around the hard stuff. The other people I had went to were really easy for me to change the subject and not deal with it.g

I dont feel like I wasted time because I learned a bunch about myself along the way I may have otherwise missed.  Every moment can be a learning moment and life's journey and the path of getting healthier mentally can be a long winding road that is about the journey rather than the end.

As most people do I thought bipolar was just the ups and downs. Depressed or Manic. My SO told me I didn't know enough about bipolar and I should do some reading. Turns out it's a complicated beast.

I've been paying more attention to my feelings and where I'm at during the day and night. At first I started feeling like my mood was rapid cycling, like within minutes of each other. As I paid more attention to my mood I started thinking about things that have given me that feeling before. So I'm feeling that feeling and then adding another memory doubling up my feelings. Feeling sad, lonely and not being good enough? Well let's add the memories of when my close friend overdosed or when my friend shot herself in the face. Feeling happy and relaxed? Let's remember those times like the birth of my kids or spending quality time with my close family. The happy feelings don't last that long as they are chased down by feelings of nostalgia. My brain tells me that times won't ever be that good again and the best has passed. The books the happiness trap and feeling good have been a good help on getting over my cognitive distortions.

Currently I'm medicated for bipolar disorder and it helps but I'm bad at eating well and sleeping right.

My feelings today have been strange to me as I get further into this journey. I feel manic and depressed at the same time often. There are times where I just feel manic or depressed but they seem to be combined most often. For example today I woke up exhausted and took my meds. I've been doing spring cleaning. I have my house from my divorce and I've been cleaning everything and getting all the junk and her stuff out of my house. I was feeling manic and motivated. While getting stuff done I felt surrounded by the ghosts of the past in my house. Lots of memories coming back. I remembered coming home the day my younger one was born and holding him in my bed and falling asleep with him in my arms. I remembered laying on my bed with the door locked crying my eyes out for what seemed to be no apparent reason and being unable to stop. I didnt want my kids to see me like that. That was the night I used the suicide text number.

My psychologist told me that I'm always doing something whether it's whatever new project I started (way to many unfinished), whatever to do list I made and I seemed to be hiding from myself.

I got a lot done today on my to do list while feeling this strong emotions. I'm trying to get my house to the point that I can manage it as a 50% dad and not have it look like a whirlwind hit it. 

After I got to a point where I felt I got enough done for the day I sat outside (left my phone inside) and just threw the Frisbee for my dog. I was told to just be and that mindfulness would be very beneficial to me enjoying life more. It felt nice to feel the sun on my skin, on my face, the warmth of it through my clothes, the light breeze gently blowing my hair, how happy my dog was just being. It was really nice. I came back inside and sat on my couch and just let all those thoughts I had set aside flood through me. I cried. I cried so fucking hard for about 15 minutes. I felt so down after for about an hour while being restless on my couch and feeling some extreme anxiety. During this time all I wanted to do was finish my to do list.

Maybe these mixed episodes are just a phase but it's really hard to process and go through. I feel a duality inside me and it's impossible for it to continue forever without me losing my shit.

I know this is rambling but it feels like where I'm at right now. The anxiety meds made me tired for about 15 minutes and now im wide awake. I used to write a lot and somewhere a long the line my ability to read and write has gone away but I feel the writing is coming back. Thanks for reading."

Does anyone else have delusions and/or paranoia that's grounded in things others can believe in?,4,mlof4r,2,"I've never been one for conspiracy theories and other types of Qanon related horseshit. 

That being said!

I've come to realize that my delusions of grandeur and general paranoia, tend to be off-shoots of things that the average person could believe in. I guess there's probably a fine line to the whole thing though. But as mentioned, government agents after me/aliens/etc. have never been something I've personally believed in during episodes. I don't want to get into specifics, but thinking that you can take up say a musical instrument and assuming you put in the effort and time, you could be the best who ever lived that played that given instrument. Every skill out there is something you could master if you cared to put the time and effort in. 

On the paranoia side, for example when in an episode, you think every ache and pain no matter how minuscule is going to kill you because it's really some terminal illness finally manifesting itself. No amount of doctor visits serve to put your mind at ease for anything beyond a short amount of time. 

I feel like in some aspects this is all worse because other people don't really ever pick up on any of it, so you've got not real barometer for how bad any of it is. Unless of course you start acting out on the things which is another thing altogether. Is it worse when you're aware of it but fight with yourself to not act on stuff, or being unaware entirely? Though I'd say the latter just because of the capacity for damage that can be caused with it. I just feel like because I work so hard to keep outward actions/thoughts I'm uncertain about (which tends to be many of them) from being expressed, it gets tiresome as well."
Looking for someone to talk to,9,mljo1m,6,"Hi, I’m looking for someone to message about my bipolar symptoms (and their damage) who really understands. I do have a therapist, psychiatrist, and I’ve called the help line at my university, but none of these things really have helped because they don’t understand the scope of bipolar. I also am medicated newly so it would be nice to talk to someone else who’s medicated but I think anyone with bipolar would really be great.

Therapist doesn't want to get me evaluated for bipolar disorder,4,mlox36,8,"Hi. I'm a teenaged girl (16f) currently suspecting I have bipolar disorder. The reason for suspecting this is twofold:My mother and sister have bipolar disorder, although only my mom is formally diagnosed. I would often watch her go from staying up late, working on housework and her job with little regard for her health one day, to crying over a bottle of beer contemplating suicide. The second reason is that my old therapist heavily suspected I had some sort of mood disorder due to my frequent, day to month long mood swings. So, I did what any reasonable person would do, and what any person here would tell me to do, and ask about possibly getting evaluated. I told him about the facts, alongside my comorbid diagnosis of executive dysfunction, but he refused to recommend evaluation, on the basis that he thought there was a high chance of misdiagnosis, and told me to come back if a bipolar symptom was actively hindering my function in life or causing problems. I don't know what to do now, because I really do think I need to get checked out for this issue, but should I pressure my therapist more on the issue? Look for a new therapist? Or try and just move on with my life?"

Does anyone ever feel like we aren’t sick we just are in a toxic environment?,10,mlg1vj,19,"So I’m bipolar 1 “supposedly” for the last 15 years and agree that I’m out of my fucking mind but in a good way. I get “out there”, like really “out there”, like mind bending LSD visions and spirt quest “out there”. I get caught up in the mental health system a lot but have never hurt myself or anyone else, I guess I have came to the realization that no matter how crazy the experience gets I will not defend myself. I know right from wrong no matter what state I’m in and won’t even try to protect my own life if it comes down to it, hardcore pacifist I would call it.

To me these experiences are profound and extremely spiritual.  I don’t do the typical things someone does when having a manic episode, I don’t blow my bank account or have risky sex, I just start bending reality. I usually go days or weeks in this state and often get fired from my jobs for not showing up. I finally lose my ability’s and get busted and thrown in the mental hospital and pumped full of drugs and then get released and go off of them seeking another manic spirit quest.

This has made my life very difficult and painful when the fun ends, I guess mania is the funnest drug I’ve ever found, I’ve done many types of drugs such as mushrooms and mescaline and mdma, and while I did feel the drugs I never experienced any of the visions I do during a manic episode. 

I know eventually if I keep going I’m probably going to die but the things I’ve experienced are out of this world in a cosmic sense and becoming medicated and losing touch with this other side of reality would destroy me. I read a lot of stories about manic episodes and I don’t see any like mine, I’m just wondering if anyone else travels the realm of the metaphysical?"
How are you kind to yourself when this disorder becomes too much?,2,mlpfc3,2,"I’ve had a shitload of Uni assignments and it will not get *any* lighter until mid-may. I’ve had such bad brain fog for days that I’m definitely going to miss a really really important deadline and my grade is going to take a hard hit. I’ve already missed deadlines, actually. I’m a little better today but I’m still definitely going to miss this deadline and get a reduced grade for a late assignment (god bless, they’ll accept it late instead of automatically failing me). It’s about 20% of my grade, too. Even the accommodations I have through the school are barely helping me. I know I’m not stupid, but man I *feel* stupid. 

How am I supposed to “be kind” to myself? This is quantifiable failure. I’m literally unable to do my work, I can’t do tasks on time. If this were a job I would be fired. There isn’t going to be a nice rest period and I can pick myself back up. This has serious long-term consequences and that’s just... how it is. But all the advice I see for when things get hard is just “be kind to yourself, be patient with yourself, let yourself rest.” I really can’t comprehend how I’m supposed to do that."

"Life is unexpected, he’s some of my story...",11,mlbpud,3,"I am a 33 year old male here. I’ve suffered with bipolar disorder my whole life. When I was younger they called it manic depressive disorder. I apologize in advance if this doesn’t make any sense, I am trying my best to describe my feelings and see if anyone out there understands my feelings and struggles. When I was in elementary school I had a lot of energy. My teacher told my mom to get me checked for ADHD. My doctor told my mother it’s manic depressive disorder and that I have been in a long time manic state and therefore my over excitement is from that and not an ADHD issue. I used to get bullied when I was younger for my teeth being too big, my chin being too small(I have an underdeveloped chin and it looks like I have an overbite. Then I went to junior high school and that’s where I started feeling depressed. I had my first suicidal thought and became suicidal at 10-11 because of the stigma I was facing in jr high. A lot more bullying but now even meaner. I was a straight A’s student and I was always big hearted and liked to help people. With that I was taken advantage of and bullied. When I finished jr high at 13 I then started going thru puberty and gained a lot of height and natural cut as far as body shape because I was skinny. I gained a little confidence in myself. So now I’m a teenager and I’m thinking differently about life. Now I’m trying to get a girlfriend be popular typical teen wants based on how I grew up. I soon realized that my mental illness is catching up to me a lot worse than when I was a kid and I found myself hard to have relationships with people. Girls didn’t want to deal with my crazy constant mood swings which made it hard to have a girlfriend. So I go thru high school feeling alone and unwanted. In this time I get this massive rush of sexual feelings where I’m extremely horny and every girl I was even a little interested in I wanted to have a sexual relationship with. This ended up being good and bad. I eventually then started having sexual relationships with older women when I was a teen. I gained this false confidence and pride. A bunch of people in my inner circle which is really small were people from the wrong side of the tracks and introduced me to drugs alcohol and other things of that nature. I gained an admiration for being a criminal or gangster. I’m from NYC and come from a old criminal enclave. I got this instant rush of breaking rules and going against the grain. I then was exposed to all these things like fighting and violence, habitual drug and alcohol use, and wild and risky sex. For some reason I felt better in this environment than my normal life. I should’ve added this before but I come from a tight knit family with typical European family values, we were sheltered from the outside world. Once exposed I literally went against everything I was taught but not on purpose, it was more a natural thing. Now I’m 18 years old I dropped out of college because I couldn’t handle it mentally. I always had this feeling like I was ugly and unattractive. I ended up getting pretty much my whole upper body tattooed with different tattoos that mean different things to me. I always felt it was the best way to express yourself and I feel if people see my tattoos they would be able to understand what I am about a little easier. I also feel like I deserve pain so I take it with the tattoos. At that point I’m completely out of control with my life. I did get a blue collar job and I am really good at my trade which kept me busy most of the time and it helped get my mind off things. When I was 19 I met my wife. I fell in love instantly with her and she did not pick up on my bipolar she just saw a nice guy with a big heart. After marrying her she began to see my bipolar and my mental illness. We got married and now have two kids a girl and a boy. After I had a death in the family I became extremely suicidal with thoughts and even acts. I began an intense therapy and psychiatry regimen. They put me on as a high risk and under suicide watch. I was on Wellbutrin, olanzapine, quetiapine, depakote, lithium, colonzipam as my cocktail. I was taking these prescriptions and it was making me feel like a potato. I expressed myself to my dr and therapist. I eventually stopped taking them and quit going to the dr and therapist. I always argued with the dr but the therapist was great a non bias person to talk to. I moved out of NYC to another state and felt much better. But then it hit me hard again and now without treatment. I have no fear of anything or anyone. I get violent and black out and just attack. I get offended so easily. I feel like everyone is fake and a user. I don’t cheat on my wife but I have this wild sex drive that I cannot control. I love flirting with women and getting attention from them( must be because I’m so insecure and when manic I get overly excited and filled with that manic confidence). I feel like my kids were brought into a fucked up heartless world and I feel like I cursed them by putting them on this earth with so much hurt. I feel like it’s because of my own experience that I feel that. I have so many things in my head that make me miserable. I wake up angry because I am so sad and depressed. I don’t go to a dr because I don’t want to be medicated again. I know people in my situation are supposed to be treated for the rest of their lives but I had such a bad last experience that I don’t want to deal with it again. When I’m manic I’m literally an attention whore. I’m genuinely a great hearted person but my mental illness does not allow me to live a normal life with my family that I love. I don’t want to lose my wife because I have this constant need for a woman’s attention and Im always flirting because I can’t control myself. She also doesn’t like to go anywhere with me because the slightest thing ticks me off and I’ll start arguing and fighting. If I do get physical I get pretty bad because I can’t control my anger. I have never been physical in my life with any women or my kids, it’s only men that I have had any physical altercation with. I’ve been in a couple of life and death situations because of this. Currently I am depressed and sad. I’m so down that I’m fed up with life and I don’t want to continue, but I have so much to live for. It’s so hard when your mental illness controls you and your daily life. I can never be normal and I never felt being normal ever. My emotions swing around all day long which makes me mentally tired and unable to function in day to day life. I read the older you get the worse the bipolar gets. All my characteristics that I thought made me are actually the bipolar disorder symptoms which makes me feel like my whole life is a lie and I actually want to be a different person that what I am seen as. Not to many people know about my illness and I don’t like talking about it because when I do it makes things worse. Thank you for anyone who reads this and I today gained the confidence to make this post. I do feel much better writing this post up.

EDIT- I forgot to add that I am currently in a six figure job and have been for a long time. I have not been able to save any money. No matter how much I try I spend spend spend. If I see something that catches me I have to get it. This also puts a lot of strain in my life as well."

Using me for drugs and money and making me feel like I did something wrong. I had to cut all my friends out. And finally met up with someone sober and had a great talk for hours.

Does anyone else have delusions and/or paranoia that's grounded in things others can believe in?,5,mlof4r,2,"I've never been one for conspiracy theories and other types of Qanon related horseshit. 

That being said!

I've come to realize that my delusions of grandeur and general paranoia, tend to be off-shoots of things that the average person could believe in. I guess there's probably a fine line to the whole thing though. But as mentioned, government agents after me/aliens/etc. have never been something I've personally believed in during episodes. I don't want to get into specifics, but thinking that you can take up say a musical instrument and assuming you put in the effort and time, you could be the best who ever lived that played that given instrument. Every skill out there is something you could master if you cared to put the time and effort in. 

On the paranoia side, for example when in an episode, you think every ache and pain no matter how minuscule is going to kill you because it's really some terminal illness finally manifesting itself. No amount of doctor visits serve to put your mind at ease for anything beyond a short amount of time. 

I feel like in some aspects this is all worse because other people don't really ever pick up on any of it, so you've got not real barometer for how bad any of it is. Unless of course you start acting out on the things which is another thing altogether. Is it worse when you're aware of it but fight with yourself to not act on stuff, or being unaware entirely? Though I'd say the latter just because of the capacity for damage that can be caused with it. I just feel like because I work so hard to keep outward actions/thoughts I'm uncertain about (which tends to be many of them) from being expressed, it gets tiresome as well."
Looking for someone to talk to,9,mljo1m,6,"Hi, I’m looking for someone to message about my bipolar symptoms (and their damage) who really understands. I do have a therapist, psychiatrist, and I’ve called the help line at my university, but none of these things really have helped because they don’t understand the scope of bipolar. I also am medicated newly so it would be nice to talk to someone else who’s medicated but I think anyone with bipolar would really be great. 

I hope this is okay to post if not I’ll delete it!

Edit: A few people have already reached out and I'm very thankful for this! I think I'm okay on messages for now though!"
Therapist doesn't want to get me evaluated for bipolar disorder,4,mlox36,8,"Hi. I'm a teenaged girl (16f) currently suspecting I have bipolar disorder. The reason for suspecting this is twofold:My mother and sister have bipolar disorder, although only my mom is formally diagnosed. I would often watch her go from staying up late, working on housework and her job with little regard for her health one day, to crying over a bottle of beer contemplating suicide. The second reason is that my old therapist heavily suspected I had some sort of mood disorder due to my frequent, day to month long mood swings. So, I did what any reasonable person would do, and what any person here would tell me to do, and ask about possibly getting evaluated. I told him about the facts, alongside my comorbid diagnosis of executive dysfunction, but he refused to recommend evaluation, on the basis that he thought there was a high chance of misdiagnosis, and told me to come back if a bipolar symptom was actively hindering my function in life or causing problems. I don't know what to do now, because I really do think I need to get checked out for this issue, but should I pressure my therapist more on the issue? Look for a new therapist? Or try and just move on with my life?"
Struggling today.,4,mll8lc,2,Struggling with self esteem and am way too aware of how people in my life have hurt me and how I’m a bad person. It’s making it difficult to get through my shift. Just want to go home and curl into a ball in bed but there’s a dog at my house that’s just going to bark at me and bite me over and over cause I’m such a shitty dog owner.
I talked to the psych today (very unimportant),6,mlj9sb,2,"I talked to the psych yesterday but had a real shit day at work and a breakdown last night.

I feel a bit better today. We talked about cutting back on the weed and caffeine, and exercising and eating more, and I haven't smoked today. I'm still depressed as all fuck. Life still sucks and I don't really see a reason to continue to live other than my cat and my S/O. I'd be fired if my boss could fire me right now and I cant do anything right. But at least my psych was pretty cool and not condescending so I am looking forward to meeting again and hopefully I'll have a good week and progress to report. Don't think I'm gonna feel any better though but there's always hope."

Does anyone ever feel like we aren’t sick we just are in a toxic environment?,10,mlg1vj,19,"So I’m bipolar 1 “supposedly” for the last 15 years and agree that I’m out of my fucking mind but in a good way. I get “out there”, like really “out there”, like mind bending LSD visions and spirt quest “out there”. I get caught up in the mental health system a lot but have never hurt myself or anyone else, I guess I have came to the realization that no matter how crazy the experience gets I will not defend myself. I know right from wrong no matter what state I’m in and won’t even try to protect my own life if it comes down to it, hardcore pacifist I would call it.

To me these experiences are profound and extremely spiritual.  I don’t do the typical things someone does when having a manic episode, I don’t blow my bank account or have risky sex, I just start bending reality. I usually go days or weeks in this state and often get fired from my jobs for not showing up. I finally lose my ability’s and get busted and thrown in the mental hospital and pumped full of drugs and then get released and go off of them seeking another manic spirit quest.

This has made my life very difficult and painful when the fun ends, I guess mania is the funnest drug I’ve ever found, I’ve done many types of drugs such as mushrooms and mescaline and mdma, and while I did feel the drugs I never experienced any of the visions I do during a manic episode. 

I know eventually if I keep going I’m probably going to die but the things I’ve experienced are out of this world in a cosmic sense and becoming medicated and losing touch with this other side of reality would destroy me. I read a lot of stories about manic episodes and I don’t see any like mine, I’m just wondering if anyone else travels the realm of the metaphysical?"
Mixed episodes and denying the intensity of your feelings.,3,mlpzxq,1,"Not sure where to start so I will pick here. Right now I feel like letting every manic urge I'm feeling just fucking run wild. Most of that was drinking, lots of meaningless sex with random girls, spending money I don't have, drugs, starting 15 new projects at once.

Slight TL;DR: Took psych evals and they didn't show up as bipolar. My brain constantly thinks things like ""hey you can't be that depressed because other people are more depressed and kill themselves"". So I answer slightly depressed. These evals were after I went to the ER so I didn't kill myself. 

Now onto my story/problem.. I was reading and something said to not compare yourself to others in regards to things in life because your feelings only need to be validated by how they make you feel. I may be poor compared to someone like those three richest guys but that doesn't matter. I make decent money and am shit at budgeting. I feel poor because I have more than enough and I can't make it work properly. I feel anxiety really bad, I'm sweating having trouble breathing or functioning. I must not have that bad anxiety because others have panic attacks. Instead I decided to realize that I'm having literal panic attacks and downplaying it to my psychologist and psychiatrist. I've decided to let myself feel those feelings and compare them to my center.

So far it's been fucking brutal. I spent decades pretending I could bottle my feelings and I could fix my mental issues alone. Self medicating with alcohol doesn't work because my demons can swim. My psychologist said that I'm what they call ""flat"" and that my outward emotional expression is really hard to read and mostly neutral. The only time he said there is a change is when we talk about something I'm interested in and I seem slightly excited. It also turns out that most people don't get asked if they are autistic in their lives. Ive been asked several times. High processing speed and emotionless has gotten me called a robot by people close to me.

So far I've been diagnosed with adhd, bi-polar, not bi-polar, GAD, PTSD, not PTSD, persistive depressive disorder severe with anxious distress, and the Doc at the mental hospital also had an opinion but I can't remember. I spent a week at the mental and felt like the doctors didn't take me seriously because of my ""flat"" personality and my comparison to others rather than to myself.

I answered honestly to my psychiatrist on the intake and she takes me seriously in a way the others don't. She said I presented with bipolar. My SO also said I might be bipolar. I talked to my psychologist and explained how I didn't feel I was as honest as I could have been. I explained some of my behaviors that have been happening since I was a kid. He is on my team now. I picked him as a psychologist because he is dry like I am and he doesn't let me walk around the hard stuff. The other people I had went to were really easy for me to change the subject and not deal with it.g

I dont feel like I wasted time because I learned a bunch about myself along the way I may have otherwise missed.  Every moment can be a learning moment and life's journey and the path of getting healthier mentally can be a long winding road that is about the journey rather than the end.

As most people do I thought bipolar was just the ups and downs. Depressed or Manic. My SO told me I didn't know enough about bipolar and I should do some reading. Turns out it's a complicated beast.

I've been paying more attention to my feelings and where I'm at during the day and night. At first I started feeling like my mood was rapid cycling, like within minutes of each other. As I paid more attention to my mood I started thinking about things that have given me that feeling before. So I'm feeling that feeling and then adding another memory doubling up my feelings. Feeling sad, lonely and not being good enough? Well let's add the memories of when my close friend overdosed or when my friend shot herself in the face. Feeling happy and relaxed? Let's remember those times like the birth of my kids or spending quality time with my close family. The happy feelings don't last that long as they are chased down by feelings of nostalgia. My brain tells me that times won't ever be that good again and the best has passed. The books the happiness trap and feeling good have been a good help on getting over my cognitive distortions.

Currently I'm medicated for bipolar disorder and it helps but I'm bad at eating well and sleeping right.

My feelings today have been strange to me as I get further into this journey. I feel manic and depressed at the same time often. There are times where I just feel manic or depressed but they seem to be combined most often. For example today I woke up exhausted and took my meds. I've been doing spring cleaning. I have my house from my divorce and I've been cleaning everything and getting all the junk and her stuff out of my house. I was feeling manic and motivated. While getting stuff done I felt surrounded by the ghosts of the past in my house. Lots of memories coming back. I remembered coming home the day my younger one was born and holding him in my bed and falling asleep with him in my arms. I remembered laying on my bed with the door locked crying my eyes out for what seemed to be no apparent reason and being unable to stop. I didnt want my kids to see me like that. That was the night I used the suicide text number.

My psychologist told me that I'm always doing something whether it's whatever new project I started (way to many unfinished), whatever to do list I made and I seemed to be hiding from myself.

I got a lot done today on my to do list while feeling this strong emotions. I'm trying to get my house to the point that I can manage it as a 50% dad and not have it look like a whirlwind hit it. 

After I got to a point where I felt I got enough done for the day I sat outside (left my phone inside) and just threw the Frisbee for my dog. I was told to just be and that mindfulness would be very beneficial to me enjoying life more. It felt nice to feel the sun on my skin, on my face, the warmth of it through my clothes, the light breeze gently blowing my hair, how happy my dog was just being. It was really nice. I came back inside and sat on my couch and just let all those thoughts I had set aside flood through me. I cried. I cried so fucking hard for about 15 minutes. I felt so down after for about an hour while being restless on my couch and feeling some extreme anxiety. During this time all I wanted to do was finish my to do list.

Maybe these mixed episodes are just a phase but it's really hard to process and go through. I feel a duality inside me and it's impossible for it to continue forever without me losing my shit.

I know this is rambling but it feels like where I'm at right now. The anxiety meds made me tired for about 15 minutes and now im wide awake. I used to write a lot and somewhere a long the line my ability to read and write has gone away but I feel the writing is coming back. Thanks for reading."
How are you kind to yourself when this disorder becomes too much?,2,mlpfc3,2,"I’ve had a shitload of Uni assignments and it will not get *any* lighter until mid-may. I’ve had such bad brain fog for days that I’m definitely going to miss a really really important deadline and my grade is going to take a hard hit. I’ve already missed deadlines, actually. I’m a little better today but I’m still definitely going to miss this deadline and get a reduced grade for a late assignment (god bless, they’ll accept it late instead of automatically failing me). It’s about 20% of my grade, too. Even the accommodations I have through the school are barely helping me. I know I’m not stupid, but man I *feel* stupid. 

How am I supposed to “be kind” to myself? This is quantifiable failure. I’m literally unable to do my work, I can’t do tasks on time. If this were a job I would be fired. There isn’t going to be a nice rest period and I can pick myself back up. This has serious long-term consequences and that’s just... how it is. But all the advice I see for when things get hard is just “be kind to yourself, be patient with yourself, let yourself rest.” I really can’t comprehend how I’m supposed to do that."

"Life is unexpected, he’s some of my story...",11,mlbpud,3,"I am a 33 year old male here. I’ve suffered with bipolar disorder my whole life. When I was younger they called it manic depressive disorder. I apologize in advance if this doesn’t make any sense, I am trying my best to describe my feelings and see if anyone out there understands my feelings and struggles. When I was in elementary school I had a lot of energy. My teacher told my mom to get me checked for ADHD. My doctor told my mother it’s manic depressive disorder and that I have been in a long time manic state and therefore my over excitement is from that and not an ADHD issue. I used to get bullied when I was younger for my teeth being too big, my chin being too small(I have an underdeveloped chin and it looks like I have an overbite. Then I went to junior high school and that’s where I started feeling depressed. I had my first suicidal thought and became suicidal at 10-11 because of the stigma I was facing in jr high. A lot more bullying but now even meaner. I was a straight A’s student and I was always big hearted and liked to help people. With that I was taken advantage of and bullied. When I finished jr high at 13 I then started going thru puberty and gained a lot of height and natural cut as far as body shape because I was skinny. I gained a little confidence in myself. So now I’m a teenager and I’m thinking differently about life. Now I’m trying to get a girlfriend be popular typical teen wants based on how I grew up. I soon realized that my mental illness is catching up to me a lot worse than when I was a kid and I found myself hard to have relationships with people. Girls didn’t want to deal with my crazy constant mood swings which made it hard to have a girlfriend. So I go thru high school feeling alone and unwanted. In this time I get this massive rush of sexual feelings where I’m extremely horny and every girl I was even a little interested in I wanted to have a sexual relationship with. This ended up being good and bad. I eventually then started having sexual relationships with older women when I was a teen. I gained this false confidence and pride. A bunch of people in my inner circle which is really small were people from the wrong side of the tracks and introduced me to drugs alcohol and other things of that nature. I gained an admiration for being a criminal or gangster. I’m from NYC and come from a old criminal enclave. I got this instant rush of breaking rules and going against the grain. I then was exposed to all these things like fighting and violence, habitual drug and alcohol use, and wild and risky sex. For some reason I felt better in this environment than my normal life.

How do you come out to your partner about your Bipolar diagnosis?,4,mlg1ad,9,"I am a 31 year old male diagnosed with Bipolar 1 Disorder.

The specifics of my diagnosis are unclear, whether it is a familial genetics heritability, although I am certain it is from my childhood trauma from years of neglect, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse from my parents and others. 

Well, lately I’ve been noticing moderate to intense mood swings and irritability, and other general mania symptoms. I’ve come seeking advice on how to come out to your partner about your diagnosis. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 4 months, and honestly haven’t been able to tell her about my diagnosis. For a number of reasons. I’ve harbored a shame about my diagnosis because of all the destruction its wreaked in my life. I’ve felt I can protect my relationship if I held it back from her or protected her from the truth, but lately its been causing disagreements and arguments.

I just don’t have the words. How can I tell her? I’ve thought of showing her my diagnosis letter from my psychiatrist and so far it seems like my best bet."

I currently live in fear that people don’t like me. That they think I’m weird or off. I’ve never had such terrible self esteem. I see a therapist and am on mediation but it doesn’t stop the incessant thoughts worrying about people and every interaction I have.

"Told a friend that I had feelings for him, now I need to burn down my house and move to France",29,ml2c86,8,"I've been manic for at least 2 weeks.   I'm not getting any sleep, I'm sleeping like 2 hours a night.  I feel like I'm going to die yet also I feel fucking amazing.

I just had an adult conversation in which I said things.

This is how I feel right now:

Me:   Jesus take the wheel!

Camera:   Pans out to show that I'm saying this after I already ran the car into a brick wall and it's not even drivable  


edited:   It's ""the morning after"".    I only slept 3 hours last night and my eyes flew open at 3am and  I was like, ""Hello darkness my old friend...""  


 I'm still manic but I'm ok.  I went jogging at 6am this morning with a friend who helped me process what I did yesterday.  


I have no emotional hangover.   Not one regret.  What I said, actually needed to be said.     I have a lot of feelings in general and they are all very close to the surface and I am ok with this, I accept this about myself and thank God so do my friends.     


I am not picking out white dresses and running off to Vegas.   I saw him this morning after jogging, we had coffee, I just got home.   It was so unbelievably relaxed and natural.   There was no quid pro quo, no expectations, no ""what do you think about what I said last night"".   Just two friends having coffee and there was nothing special about it, except that one friend likes the other friend, and this fact is known and accepted and it's ok.   It's a fact like he has dark hair or that I had cream in my coffee.   Just a known fact, nothing that anyone needs to ""do something with or about"".  


Whether or not this ""thing"" has legs, I have no idea.   I don't need to know today, I don't need to figure everything out today.   It will be ok either way.

Rehabilitating myself from home?,2,mley1t,2,"I am bipolar type I with mixed features. I’ve been swinging between high and low for several months now, I had some stretches of stability but mostly manic and hypomanic episodes, with bad lows when I crash. I’m still not recovered from my latest episode and I think I may now be in a mixed episode. I feel emotionally unstable. 

First let me just say: I am not at risk of hurting myself or others. I have however considered hospitalization because I feel so overwhelmed by my life. I’ve done some thinking and have concluded that a hospital stay isn’t financially possible right now unless it’s an emergency situation. I can’t afford inpatient treatment either. 

I’ve decided I want to rehabilitate myself from home. I want to rest, recenter and figure out a plan for getting my shit together. I’m not using any illegal drugs or alcohol right now so there isn’t any physical danger in remaining at home versus the hospital. 

I’d love it if anyone here had any tips or advice on things I can do at home to recover. If anyone here has been to rehab, I’d love to hear about what aspects of it helped you so I can try to incorporate those concepts.  I am not asking for any medical/professional opinions but rather just an open conversation on what worked for you during your experiences in treatment."

Lamictal Rash,2,mlen24,12,"Hello!

My pysch started me on a low dose of Lamictal (25mg) but after around twoish weeks, I started getting random rashes, so she put me down to 12.5 for a week. After that, I went back up to 25mg and got a hive on my neck and general itchiness around that area and my inner arms. She suggested to go back down to 12.5mg until our next appointment (which was today). I took it one more day but then when the rash didn't go down, I stopped for three days total (Saturday through Monday). 

I'm concerned about Lamictal rash. I do have sensitive skin and the weather is changing, but I feel like it's connected to the Lamictal. My pysch is not worried about the rash at all and says if it was SJS it would have happened in the first two weeks that I was on the medication. 

Online publications say it can happen at any time, so I'm not sure if what she is saying is true. These meds are def helping (I'm not diagnosed as Bipolar, it's for another issue), but I am scared of the random itchiness I am getting taking these pills. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Benign, random rashes on Lamictal that aren't a big deal? My pysch isn't worried at all, but there are so many resources that say if you get a rash or hives to stop use immediately. 

Thank you!"

Got kicked out of hospital tonight.,22,mkk96p,11,"Went in around 2. My therapist told me to go because my depression has been so bad. First they made me take off all my clothes even undies and put on paper scrubs that were very, very small. Like I couldn’t even pull the top to my waistline. Nor the bottoms for that matter. Just had my big ole fat person skin spilling out all over. And they put me in the hallway b Ed in the ER while they waited for a place to put me. When they finally got me out of the ER it was the PEC unit. I guess it’s the phase between ER and being admitted to the unit. It socks. You get lok a jail bed. It’s bolted to the floor. Vinyl. You get two blankets. One to use as a pillow. At least there was a tv. No remote. You had to stand next to the tv and hit buttons there to go up or down. 

Then it came time for night time meds. The gave me my night mare meds.  My zolpidem. Then dropped the bomb that I can’t take my specially compounded fibromyalgia meds. Without those meds I’ll be in chronic pain. Like opioid pain. But they couldn’t figure out how to get the pharmacist to approve my compounded medication. And the nursed even after I tried to explain about 4 different ways, just never seemed to quite understand what “compounding” is. And the pharmacist just.... idk. 

I threw a fit. Said I didn’t want to be there if it was gonna cause a flare.
So they discharged me. At 10! Pm on a Sunday when my potential rides are an hour away because that’s where I live. Finally got one friend to get me. He’s none too happy. He was ready for bed. I am grateful to him.  But fuck those psych nurses and fuck that pharmacist."

"Anyone here ever hit with a dose of human interaction thats considered normal for most folks, and realize how badly you need it and how completely detached you are from that world?",18,mkd5wi,4,"tldr: drove across my state to pick up a girl I barely knew to hang out/stay over for a few days, it didn't go well.

*ahem* it's a bit of a book, but I'm trying to give a full picture, bear with me. 

My dumb-assin-ass did a stupid thing and drove across my state to pick up a girl I barely knew because we'd recently connected via social media over a post I made about the crushing conditions of modern society, and how little I wanted to be a part of it. She was stuck in our hometown, and by my estimation caught between her own bad habits and her toxic surroundings. (Drugs, bad friends, etc)

We'd started talking and quickly progressed to oversharing some pretty dark stuff about ourselves, to the point where we basically blew past the regular ""getting to know each other"" stuff. We'd gotten to the point where we'd started feeling some kind of intimate kinship in our shared experiences, regardless of the fact that we'd not even hung out in person. (we had talked on the phone a few times) 

The plan had been to hang out at my house (which my mother owns, and which I have to myself), and just kick it for a few days, do some gardening/other wholesome activities. I've been living in this house for years and have done a lot to structure my environment and activities to help me maintain a healthy lifestyle, as well as allowing me to keep up with my responsibilities. 

I'd been telling her about how much I benefited from simple activities like gardening, fish keeping, and yoga, and how I had all the gear to go on a little wilderness/beach adventure if she was up for it. She'd mentioned some toxic ex who'd been threatening her, or rather had threatened her in the past, not gonna lie, the details were sketchy and I didn't ask too many questions. Shit happens, you seem cool, and I think we both could use the company. 

I'd floated the idea of her maybe moving in (down the line) if she liked the place, and was willing to hold up her end (hold down a job, pay bills, etc - something I'm very much still trying to do myself). She'd been bouncing from crap job to crap job, and was getting extremely discouraged with her prospects, I have some connections in my city that could help her land a reasonable gig that'll at least serve as a jumping-off point.

I've been unemployed waiting to get my covid vaccine, and basically have spent the last few months in pretty intense isolation, which definitely contributed to my impulsivity. I had been working as a substance abuse counselor in a correctional setting before the pandemic started, and I had done well at it too, but decided to quit to visit a family member overseas, didn't end up going (thanks covid).

Long story short I spent most of the pandemic staying home, gardening, and really honing my musical skills (probably the *only* silver lining to my pandemic experience). I've always been a bit of a loner/isolated, even though many people seem to consider me to be a highly social person (I can be to a point), but the pandemic, and the total absence of normal socialization led to some pretty sketchy hookups that were fun, but ultimately regrettable. I've been extremely deprived of both normal person to person interaction, as well as physical contact, is my point.

She agreed to stay over a few days, so I packed up and drove three hours to get her. Upon arriving at her house I met her mother, who (100% justifiably) was quite skeptical about this strange man who'd come (seemingly) out of the blue to whisk her daughter away. I explained that I'd been talking to her about some of my hobbies and how helpful they'd been for me, which seemed to put her at enough ease for us to pack up and hit the road without incident.

The drive to my city was long, we listened to music, talked, and generally had a good time being in each other's presence for the first time in like 10 years, initially a bit strange, but we were at ease with each other soon enough. We'd had to stop and pick up a prescription for her on the way, got a few groceries, and we'd run into her ex boyfriends father (who was in possession of her dog, and taking terrible care of it), he didn't recognize her, and we didn't say anything to him. Having concluded our detour, we hit the road. 

Upon arriving back in my city, I gave her a tour of the place, and we decided to just kick it and watch some shows (I recall bob's burgers and it's always sunny). We'd gotten cuddled up and things seemed to be going alright, she was tired/a little under the weather (fingers crossed it isn't covid), so we decided to both turn in early, which I for the life of me couldn't. 

I couldn't stop shifting around trying to find a good position to sleep, so I finally asked her if she'd be okay with me being the little spoon (cuddling closer than we had before), she said sure. Words can't describe the deep peace and the comfort I felt being held like that, I can't remember the last time I felt that good, easily better than sex, for there was a sense of peace and wholeness here that I have lacked for as long as I care to think back. (I've had some good relationships in the past, but nothing for some time)

I stopped shifting around but ultimately decided to just let her sleep and move into another room since apparently sleep wasn't happening for me anytime soon. I'd been in talks with the director of the rehab facility I'd been working at, regarding their desire to hire me back at an insultingly low salary, and I'd been preparing to counteroffer, as well as bringing some sample materials I'd like to use in class and group activities. Our repertoire at the facility had been atrocious (corrections, go figure). Stuff like little video essays on mental health (philosophy, conformity, etc,), some relevant clips from movies and TV shows, as well as some relevant music, good material.

Whenever I tired of combing the depths of YouTube for content, and deciding which materials to present in which order, with which activity/discussion topic to follow the material, I shifted into a different activity. I love art and have decorated my bedroom richly with posters, prints, as well as art-postcards basically collaged onto the wall. I'd found the process of decorating my space to be quite rewarding, so I started to lay down the postcards on the tile-floor of my large, barely furnished living-room, in order to get an overview of what I had on hand.

As I laid the cards out, I started to realize that I was actually having fun and taking my time laying the postcards out, rearranging them, and even creating forced-perspective continuous images from some of my black and white postcards of a barbed wire adorned Berlin wall. Just playing, I am a sucker for minimally structured, creative activities (in a therapeutic setting), took some pictures, and took note of this as a potential group activity. 

Once I finished laying the postcards out across most of the living room floor, still not tired, I shifted gears and started to look over some of the stuff I'd written over the years (specifically the *good* pile). I'd developed a writing technique for myself that involved distilling content to its purest form (usually just a clean hook or a punchline), and flipping to a fresh page if I couldn't think of any way to develop the idea further. It led to tons of post-it's and pieces of notebook paper with hastily scrawled hooks and punchlines, as well as longer stretches of lyrics, and once again I'd learned how fun it was to rearrange these different little tid-bits into something more substantial.

So passed the night, never going to sleep for fear of disturbing my guest. Upon awakening in the morning she didn't seem to be feeling so great and started to talk about her (stolen, neglected) dog, and how she really needed to get her (the dog) out of her current situation. Seeing her beat around the bush I point blank asked if she needed to go back home now to deal with this, she said yes, 5 minutes later we're on the road headed back to resolve this situation (mind you it's a 6 hour drive, there and back, I'd done the drive the day before, *hadn't slept*, and just got back in the truck and started driving).

She seemed a little on edge on the drive down (reasonable, dog welfare is a bit of a sore spot for me too). I unironically offered to steal her dog back for her, but she declined saying she'd rather go the official route (the smart thing to do, I was mostly just trying to be supportive). We didn't talk a whole lot (that I can remember, it's honestly a bit of a blur, I was focused on the road), but the vibe wasn't tense, as much as concerned. We got back to her place, I hugged her goodbye, told her to keep me updated on the situation.

Cue silence, minimal responses, just an awkward shift from what had been animated conversation. I finally called it out and asked her if I'd unintentionally offended her or crossed a boundary without realizing it, because she'd clearly started keeping me at arms length. I made it clear that I wasn't gonna be a dick if she no longer wanted anything to do with me, and that I simply wanted to know if I'd made a mistake, in order to prevent making that same mistake in the future. She informed me that she'd gotten out of a relationship too recently, and that the *mutual* cuddling had been too familiar for her and that it'd made her uncomfortable.

*fuck*

I'd made every effort to *not* be too familiar with her, due to the fact that she was away from home in a strange city, and I wasn't tryna be weird about it. She'd put herself in a vulnerable position (admittedly an objectively foolish decision on her part), but I wasn't about to do or say anything that would suggest that I intended to escalate from what had been light, cozy cuddling (think my feet crossed and propped on her legs type stuff, it had been *fine*, good even). No shady alterior motive, just the anticipation of spending a few days with a cute girl hopefully introducing her to some wholesome activities to take her mind off all the chaos at home. 

I didn't probe too much after she told me that she wasn't ready to be familiar/intimate like that, and have come to the conclusion that I must have been too familiar, asking her to spoon me (once again, no bump&grind, just sleep). I was and am mortified at having misread the situation, and having let my selfish desire to just be held by another human being blind me to the fact that I crossed a line without meaning to.

I told her, ""There's how we think we made someone feel, and then there's how we *actually* made them feel. I'm sorry I misread the situation and didn't check in more explicitly, to make sure you were okay with cuddling up a bit closer."" Ironically I'd been thinking about how to approach/discuss boundaries that night, because things can get so intense and disorganized in my mind sometimes that it's easy to get confused and send mixed/the wrong signals. 

Wellll, that should have probably been the first conversation we had, because this was an avoidable fuckup. I should have first of all recognized that I was hypo enough to not be able to come to rest, while simultaneously being so exhausted and run down that my behavior was a bit muted (especially after being up all night and having to drive another 3 hours on no sleep), she used the word ""icy"" to describe my demeanor, which I say is mischaracterizing, I was just being quiet and conserving energy. She wasnt upset with me, and said she understood where I was coming from, but clearly the vibe had been harshed, and the good times were over. 

Conclusion, I was too hyperactive to have any person who doesn't *really* know me over, and I should have listened to the part of my brain telling me I'm an idiot and called it off. But here I am, like an idiot. Happy Easter everybody. 

If you're reading this Nicole, I'm sorry. Boundaries, what are they and why am I such a fuckup. Goddammit."

My mania manifests as extreme uncomfortableness. I pace around constantly with my thoughts running a million mph. It's veryy unpleasant along with the inability to sleep. I've been in quite a bit of legal trouble due to recklessness/irresponsibility. I get little to no feelings of euphoria. I am extremely erratic during this period, sort of like a fuck it attitude, and unpredictable... it sucks!

Hopefully I can get on the right medication regime soon. Lithium seems to be a good option for Bipolar 1. (Currently on Lamictal and Seroquel 600mg).

It’s been a little hard to find info online (maybe because i don’t have my footing on the wording). I feel really confused knowing if i actually rapid cycle often or if i’m just moody and dramatic ! tytyty"
One of my coping mechanisms is to make jokes out of everything and not take anything serious. This thought popped into my head today and my thought was why shouldn't I just walk out. I have a million reasons not to but I still consider doing it at times.,511,mjlb4u,26,
Anyone else have bipolar disorder and ADHD along with fibro?,2,mkelne,6,"3 years ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, last year I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and a couple weeks ago I was diagnosed with probable ADHD. I also have depression and anxiety which I’m sure is caused by any of these conditions (oh so fun!)

Currently I’m on 200mg of Lamictal, 40mg of Cymbalta for the fibro, and just started 150mg of Wellbutrin. I also have medical marijuana which has been a lifesaver for pain and anxiety, but is hard for me to dose effectively. 

My current plan is to wean off cymbalta because I’ve never felt it did anything for me and essentially replace it with the Wellbutrin. I was warned the Wellbutrin can exasperate anxiety. 

Are there any others out there with a similar med list? I love the lamictal, but I’m very unsure about how the Wellbutrin will effect me"

Waking up and waiting to go back to bed.,16,mk1z64,11,"For the past several weeks, I've been depressed out of my mind. I've lost all interest in everything and I hurt badly. During this time, my cat also got sick and passed away. I'm miserable and don't know what to do about it. It's like I wake up and struggle to pass the time until it's time for bed again. Has anyone else felt like this, and how did you overcome this terrible feeling?"
My new psychiatrist thinks I might not be bipolar,9,mk43q0,3,"He's wrong, definitely. He'll realize as he gets to know me that my pill induced stability does not say anything about my true self and that I appear more functioning than I actually am, but at the moment, he believes I don't suffer from any affective disorder, and that it was all CPTSD related issues.

And for a moment I was relieved. So, so relieved. I thought that maybe he's right, and it was all misunderstanding. For just a second, I thought I might be in the clear, and it gave me so much comfort.

I'm not the type to call bipolarity a curse. I'm actually quite happy with what I have - I'm greatly intelligent, highly empathetic, and very talented (and this is coming from within a depressive episode). I think that neurodiversity is hard, but in many cases worth it. 

Despite this, the thought of being 'normal' seemed quite pleasing. Not because bipolarity is bad, but because it must be much, much easier to not have it. 

I'll never know, though, because it's hereditary, and it's definitely there. But still. Must be nice."

"My friend is bipolar, how to keep my relationship with him?",6,mk6mdd,4,"I have friend that I’m quite sure he is bipolar as the manic episodes applies exactly to him. He suddenly invites me and want to do activities with me, starts a new hobby, get some professional certificates, volunteering and even propose some investment idea to me to be his partner.

Then out of the blue, he ghosts me. Doesn’t respond to my calls, last time he told me to f**k off and he literally meant it and I felt really bad, I texted him back telling him that I’m there whenever he needs me. This happened the day after he gave me a ride back to my house which is 45 minutes away from his apartment. He even refused that I Uber giving me an excuse that he has to go to his parents house which is 5 min away from my house, but he actually went back to his apartment. 

This flip happened for no reason. When he is stable, sometimes he talks to me about His problems, family issues, regrets, work, his college experience etc. He acknowledges that is psychologically suffering, but as I  mentioned earlier I believe the root cause is the bipolar disorder... and he doesn’t know he has it.

Should I really f**k off? For good? I would love to say how can I help him by telling him it may be just a pill that could help you but I don’t think I could nor I dare to tell him anything about it. I just would like to get a bipolar patient perspective on this matter."

Stopping medication under doctor’s supervision and unmedicated bipolar.,3,mk8ost,18,"I’ve been taking Lamotrigene and Abilify for close to two years now. I feel like they’ve worked, but I don’t like being medicated as it were. For health reasons, I want to stop taking them. I plan to do it properly, talk to my doctor and make sure we do it in a safe way. 

I remember I stopped my lamotrigene suddenly when I first started taking it and it triggered a bit of my mania. But I feel much more prepared emotionally for an episode if it were to occur than I was back then. 

I’ve been relatively stable, I’m about to graduate school. I’m starting therapy again next week. Life’s going okay. I’ve just come to the conclusion I no longer want to take medication for my bipolar. 

Has anyone else stopped their medication safely? Is there anyone currently living unmedicated? How is it?"
Serious question if I suffer from something like mania,2,mk94cy,4,"I’m already diagnosed with complex ptsd with unrelenting anxiety, insomnia and fibromyalgia. But something worse brings me suffering that I can’t pin point and wonder if it is mania. I need “new” experiences in order to find joy or a rush. The biggest example is my life life. I bet the rush and excitement from being intimate and dating a woman for the first time. I may last a quick fling or even a relationship for a year. But it will wear off and I will start self sabotaging the relationship. I want a new date( new adventure, new face, new name. (One nasty example: I once dated a very cute sweet girl in college but it was Halloween and I was jealous of all the other guys with other girls even though I had a cute girl in pjs in my room. Like wtf. I’m thinking go all the excitement around campus and I have a lovey girl right by me but I couldn’t enjoy the moment. Not a proud moment, I hurt that girl a lot with all my baggage.) It’s one thing when 20 in college, dating abound. It’s another in your 30s and getting older! I need to find the root of why I do this and how ai can find happiness or joy in one relationship and how to overcome my multiple demons. Suggestions and advice wanted!"

"I don’t have bipolar because I don’t have manic episodes, Just random depression episodes that last two to three days at least once or twice every two weeks between a “normalcy” where I might have some bursts of energy but mostly baseline. I wonder if a med typically used for bipolar could help me.",1,mka6c0,8,"Fwiw, I’m male in mid 40s. I’ve tried several different antidepressants some that worked for a while then stopped working, most of them didn’t. My depressive episodes just come out of the blue with no warning, no trigger, and I’m convinced it’s some sort of chemical imbalance. When I first learned about cyclothymia, I thought it might be what I have, but I’m reading a lot of hypomania symptoms in most of the posts about it, so I’m not sure i fit the symptoms. 

I’m curious about trying a different type of med since I’m pretty treatment resistant with typical antidepressants, I wonder if a sort of mood stabilizer or other drug typically used with bi-polar types, could help me. If you may have any thoughts on this or suggestions I might try with my doctor, please let me know. My wife and kids understand, and give me space when I’m down, but I know it hurts them because I can’t be my normal self and it’s really hard to be around them without ruining the mood. Any help would be much appreciated."

trying to stop myself from making a man suffer for perceiving me,2,mk4yro,4,"TL;DR: i'm just now getting a handle on my diagnosis and then this guy managed to find a hole in the very tall wall i've built around myself and i'm scared and not confident in my ability to not ruin this on purpose.  


up until about 1.5 years ago, i had been in very toxic relationships with all people. i would purposefully make the men and women i was intimate with ""prove"" their love. it would get into... some sick and ugly tests. it also led me to get involved with some pretty violent individuals.

2 years ago i gave up hard drugs, and this year i was finally diagnosed and i'm currently trying to find the right combination of meds. i've been purposefully celibate for the last 4 years b/c i wanted to stop the cycle of abuse i was engaged in. 

but now there is someone and i'm letting him into my very small circle. we originally met several years ago and just recently reconnected. the fact that he knew me before has made it easy for me to be open about my past and my diagnoses (or shit maybe i'm missing all the social cues and just over-sharing 😬). anyway the information hasn't scared him off (i think).

what he doesn't know is i've been having a lot of intrusive thoughts about fucking this up on purpose. also seeing him put me into a hypomanic state, and that scared the shit out of me. i want to be just cool and calm and let things develop organically but the intrusive thoughts are screaming at me that that isn't possible. that i'm broken and i don't deserve to have anyone interested in me, even tangentially. 

maybe i'll get lucky and he'll be a cold hearted serial dater who was only interested in my body and nothing else. boy, that would solve all this + would really help reenforce the crumbling view of myself i'm still holding onto."

Why don’t I believe that other people have depression/bipolar?,3,mk1v8e,18,"I know it’s statistically and objectively true that other people have debilitating mental illness besides me, but there’s an “inherent” thought that says otherwise. I can’t bring my most natural self to believe that other people besides me are depressed. My logical self says “Other people can have depression that’s equal to or worse in severity in yours” .. my “natural/inherent” self says “You’re the only one in the world who experiences *real* depression. This unrealistic belief could be a delusion? Or it could be that I don’t believe anyone else really exists? If anyone could give me some insight into my mind"
Is anyone on Rexulti + Vraylar?,2,mk3nko,1,"I stopped Rexulti after being on Vraylar for some weeks. Rexulti did a lot for me and my prescriber didn't want me to stop it until I got results with the Vraylar - he wanted to leave well enough alone even then and have me continue taking them both, but I thought it was a bit pointless to be on two antipsychotics and I asked to try to stop Rexulti. I've noticed my mood has been declining since I stopped it, slowly enough that I didn't really attribute it to stopping Rexulti (the couple times I couldn't take Rexulti for a bit all hell broke loose in about two days), but now I'm thinking it's connected. I'm wondering if I should go back to taking them both at once.

I don't want to go off Vraylar, because it helps with negative symptoms that Rexulti didn't touch (lethargy, anhedonia), but now that I'm feeling so depressed I'm having lethargy and anhedonia again, just flavored differently.

I don't know, I'm just curious about whether people are on this meds combo and whether it worked for them. I'm also on Depakote for mania.

I'm hoping the Rexulti helps, because every SSRI or SNRI I've been on has either done nothing or made me intolerably aggressive. Latuda did nothing, Lamictal did nothing...I really want to not feel depressed. I'm not taking care of basic responsibilities."

What is something you did during a manic episode that ended up being AWESOME/SO POSITIVE,14,mjo132,22,"Most of the things I've done during a manic episode are things that i've regretted, that I am incredibly embarrassed by, things I'll regret for the rest of my life, thing I can't forgive myself for. BUT, there are things I know I will look back on years from now and laugh at. There are things I look back at now and laugh at.

BUT, what are things you've done during a manic episode that have actually been GREAT for your life? What did you do that ended up having a positive impact?

&#x200B;

* During a manic episode you shaved your head, your doctor notices a mole that ends up being cancerous and they end up conducting surgery before there's a problem and you're SAVED!

&#x200B;

* Did you decide to quit your job, end up finding out your passion ends up being painting?

&#x200B;

* You're so irritable during an episode that you hit your partner, cops are called, cops find out your partner had been abusing your kid. You never see your partner again, your kid is safe. 

&#x200B;

* You decide to share WAY too much with a random person on a customer service call...a 5 hour customer service call. All about your insecurities, your love life, and in those 5 hours, you inspire THEM to make positive changes in THEIR life. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(more extreme versions)

* You go to a cafe and your irritability and anger cause you to punch a guy you thought looked JUST LIKE your cheating EX (you were hallucinating) . Well, cops were called and they FOUND HIS MANIFESTO AND ASSAULT RIFLES apparently you thwarted his plan to assassinate Bill Gates and his entire family who was sitting a few tables away, so he ends up giving you Billions of dollars? You then go home and dye your hair pink. Doja Cat now wants to date you. 

&#x200B;

* So you decide that you are totally capable of stealing the Mona Lisa. You go to France, while conducting your surveillance inside the Louvre you spot someone who ALSO resembles your cheating ex (again you're hallucinating) and you realize he's stealing children and now he's going to sell their organs? (apparently this is a very old school teacher with whiskers taking children to the museum) Well, you start screaming and pointing at the children and the teacher, so they run away, seconds later a bomb goes off. TURNS OUT, someone was ALSO there to steal the Mona Lisa and they had planted a bomb. You have now saved a Nun and a group of school children. The Prime Minister awards you knighthood AND allows you to take the SECRET REPLICA of the Mona Lisa home...that no one knows exists...it was the original draft of the Mona Lisa that was made. MUAHAHA. You also dye your hair, Doja Cat still wants to date you."
"I want to have friends but I am not able to keep them, both in mania and depression",18,mjm7jk,4,"for all of my life, I've had only a handful of friends. I am not really good at keeping them, because I am terrible at calling or sending those messages like 'hey, how are you? it's been a while!' out of the blue. even though I do get back to anyone who send me one of those.

during school and college, I had at least one person that I was always talking to because, well, we saw each other every single day. 

when I finished college, I didn't have anyone besides my partner. they kept asking me to get someone else to talk to because they thought it would be healthier and would of course relieve some of the burden I (uncounsciously) deposited in them.

in the past few years, I was diagnosed with depression, then bipolar disorder (thanks to a terrible mania-driven debt), found out I really identify as non-binary, questioned my sexuality and my sex drive... and I've kept all emotions and thoughts about these things mostly to myself because I feel like my therapist doesn't get it (long short story, she is older and doesn't feel like I am non-binary but a woman and denying everything else. I know I should get someone else, but it's hard due to financial issues), my partner shuts off everytime I talk about anything of the sorts (and with this pandemic, being 24/7 together, I understand why they are shutting off), and the last two friends that I have are in a completely different time of their lives (one is single, with the mind of a little inocent girl (in a good sense), and the other is already a mother of two).

I have tried Slowly, my partner and I have an open relationship but I struggle to find someone because I want to talk and not really 'have sex right now', I have tried talking randomly to people in the internet, but I seem like I either am in complete mania (too many emojis and wanting to talk every second and changing the subject every time and not using a single damn comma), or I am in depression and I can't speak to anyone. 

and then, through the mania or the depression, the friendship becomes a burden to me, and I simply quit it (mostly ghosting people, which I hate) because I can't do it anymore. 

I think bipolar isn't the single cause to this, but it does complicate things very much... and right now I feel like I am getting to a very good place of stability, but at the same time I am afraid of trying to talk to anybody and iniciating a new friendship / rekindle old ones.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I've had no friends for too long and bipolar doesn't help, but I am afraid of trying to talk to anybody now that I am more stable. 

maybe someone has gone through any of this and can share something?

Does anybody else experience periods of extreme hyper sensitiveness to emotions occasionally?,22,mjgvpz,18,"This is going to sound weird, I honestly don't know if it's my bipolar II disorder or my borderline personality disorder, but sometimes maybe once every 2 weeks or more, I get extremely emotional and cry **very very** easily at things that wouldn't normally make me cry. 

For example I'm watching Godzilla versus King Kong. The most basic of sad parts in the movie are making me literally tear up and want to just bawl.

I’ve never felt so isolated and alone in my depression,11,mjg7u5,5,"I recently started seeing my ex again for the first time in a year and there seems to be a very coincidental collapse in my mental state. We dated for almost two years and lived with each other for most of it. Things were messy at the end to say the least and we still have a lot of work to do. 

Monday started with her ranting to me about her mom and then attacking me over something completely unrelated. That took me out of my normal routine, I ended up using Ativan to get to sleep and slept in way later than usual Tuesday morning. That led to me not using my light box and Ativan again that night... and there’s been a series of destabilizing events all week. 

I’ve been doing my absolute best to stay active, eat right and not drink caffeine but it just hasn’t been enough. I’ve been hitting the gym and getting out tor walks a lot. The problem for me right now is way she has been creating space for herself has been causing me issues and there hasn’t really been a good point to talk about it with her. If she needs me to not contact her for a few days so she can gather her life together that’s fine, I just need her to be more explicit.  As it stands she basically created a no contact zone for an indefinite period of time and I have no idea where her head is at. 

Over the years I’ve really struggled to make friends and I don’t currently have anybody in my life that I can hit up to hang out or even really confide in while feeling safe. Nobody understands the depression. I tried to communicate where I was to my now gf and she kinda blew me off. Just finished a two hour walk but it still doesn’t feel like enough. I reached out to a coworker to hang out tonight but I’m unsure if those plans will come through. So it’s not like I’m not trying. 

TLDR: It just sucks when I feel like I’m doing everything right and the disease still gets the best of me"
Things slipped just ever so slightly and it's been hard to prevent things from getting worse,4,mjkuxr,6,"I recently started seeing my ex girlfriend again and I think my recent bout of depression is somehow connected, but, I'm doing the work.  I've been going to the gym, I'm trying to reach out to what support network I have, I'm taking care of myself and eating right and sticking to my sleep schedule as best I can.  I've been seeing my therapist every week.  I was even down to see the Cherry Blossoms today and I must have walked 4-5 miles trying to soak up as much of the sunshine as I can.  It's hard though.  This wave of depression has hit me like a ton of bricks and I don't know if I have anybody in my life that truly has time for it.  It's also been so incredibly long since it's been this bad and it's hard to stay focused.  

It's hard to remind myself that this too shall pass when I'm being frantic and a little clingy with my ex.  It's hard when I feel like my work relationships are suffering even if it's an inconsequential amount.  My mom said I seemed a little down when I went to see her yesterday and it's all kind of coalescing.  Work stress, stress with the leasing office and the power outage earlier this week, stress with the gf and how heavy her work schedule has been and how she's creating space in a very difficult way... I think part of the problem this week was how my sleep schedule got disrupted on Tuesday after a hard conversation with the ex but.... It shouldn't only take 1 bad sleep day to do this to me.

Wow. Such emotions. I found out the day I had a huge interview. Anyways. 

They spoke with her to confirm identity, and have sent a letter from me and some pictures to her. I think she will write back too. 

During the call where they confirmed identity, she shared some details about herself and this is how I found out she’s bipolar. She lives alone, has a daughter (who doesn’t know about me). 

Oh my god I have a sister. I’m so happy, I’ve never had one before. 

Anyways - guys can you please help me understand or be aware of anything around bipolar disorder that I can do to be mindful of her condition. It’s obviously very overwhelming and emotional and I want to make sure I’m making it as easy as possible for her. 

I wonder if she started developing symptoms from having to give me up. She did try and find me again when I was 2 but could not get any information, lack of rights.

What are in everyone’s opinion are the best ssri’s that help with anxiety. Just want to mention possibilities to try with my psychiatrist. He’s the best doctor I’ve ever had but I’m the most anxious I’ve ever been. I don’t want to be on any tranquilizers because I used to binge on substances and I can’t go down that road again especially since I’ll be back in my office soon.  Please help guys!! 😘 thanks in advance

I can't tell what's me anymore.,15,mj3xc3,6,"Hello, 

I've been on this kick to find places where I can talk about aspects of me and bipolar is definitely one of them.

Like the title says, even before I was diagnosed, I have no idea what's real anymore. Not in terms of reality, I think anyway, but more so what's a genuine and naturally occurring feeling and what's a ""corrupted"" or ""influenced"" feeling / idea. Here's what I mean:

One day I wake up and my first thought is of suicide. Nothing triggered it, there's no stress, the sun's shining, everything is as it should be and yet that's my first thought shortly after I open my eyes (in fact, this was one of the first clues I had that something was seriously wrong with me). This is clearly not a thought that I willed into existence, it is a thought that was put there or encouraged or magnified by a depressive episode.

On the flip side, I'm happy, but like really happy and loose and giggly and I'm the wittiest guy alive and I care and I'm going to cure cancer and run for president and write a book. That's not normal either because my base state is a very calm and quiet self. These ""happy"" thoughts are fake. They weren't put there by me, they were put there by this hypomanic episode. I don't actually want to run for president, I can't actually cure cancer, and I generally could care less, but im also not the worst, I don't deserve to die, and everything is chill. 

That's without lithium.

Lithium has been a fantastic equalizer although I'm concerned about the side effects I keep reading about and what would happen if I ever got off it. It scares the shit out of me. On lithium, I still can't tell where I start and the drug begins. The peaks that were once the rockies are now the Appalachians. The iceberg of depression is now an ice cube. Instead of uncontrollable belly laughter and rainbows coming out of my ass, I smile gently and laugh accordingly.

Is this me? Or is this me on drugs? Is the great capacity for extreme emotion me? Or is that the disease? Was the happiness I felt genuine, or have I never felt ""normal"" happiness at all? Have I been a prisoner along for the ride locked inside and freed by lithium, or has that person never existed? I've always been one extreme or the other, I don't remember a time when I was simply me. Now I feel like I have training wheels on and a gentle hand on my back guiding me through life and while I appreciate not waking up to a hangmans noose, nothing matters anymore, everything is aight, I have no hobbies and don't look forward to anything and don't enjoy anything that much. 

It feels like someone strapped pillows to the sides of my face and everything is muffled. Off of lithium I'm an uncontrollable fusion reactor, or I'm a lifeless abyss. 

When I said I believe my base is calm and quiet and I'm quite uncaring, that's a wild guess. I really don't know. Every time I enjoy something or really enjoy something I wonder if that's just the mania. Every time I obsess and hyper focus I wonder if that's normal or just some other chemical imbalance. Every time I get irritable and it doesn't go away after a day, I think of the poor soul on the receiving end having to deal with someone who has no control over themselves. Who has no understanding of why they do what they do and is at the mercy of their wild unstable emotions as much as they are. 

I'll either tenderly care for you, or I'll brutalize you, or I'll be an endless void that will suck the emotion out of a room. There is no middle. 

Thanks for reading even if you don't respond. I don't actually expect to have you answer the question of where I begin. I try to keep my life as busy as possible so I don't think about such things, but I hate unanswered questions and I can't wrap my head around this."

Treatments for Bipolar neurodegradation i.e. memory loss and executive function deficit?,11,miy81i,4,"Are there any documented treatments in the medical literature or in your experience that counteracts the brain damaging effects of mood in BP?

I’ve seen vitamin E in the form of tocotrinols helps brain damage after a stroke. And (low dose) lithium is fertilizer for a brain. Exercise helps the brain in multiple ways.

I keep a jar for “random-thought notes” in my bathroom. For fun I dumped it out... it’s clear that hyper sexuality got me good this past fall.,13,miwsol,13,
I just need to write this.,9,miye7u,7,"I have never disclosed most of this to anyone including plethra of therapists. 

I grew up in a not so stable home. Physical needs were met...food, shelter, etc. What no one knew was my father was a raging alcoholic and my mother was a manipulating, mentally ill woman capable of whittling down a person's self esteem within 3 sentences. Hell my brother used to enjoy getting everyone riled up out of spite and would stand back to enjoy the fall out. That left me, the youngest, to smooth tensions out, to be the master of peace keeping. My earliest memory of that was at 4 years old. That's a lot of stress on a 4 year old. The yelling, walking on egg shells, the physical violence left an impression. 

I did well through the early part of grade school. My perfectionism was starting to come through. The older I got the harder it was for me to interact with my peers. One teacher pulled me aside and said I was different...I was much more mature than my siblings.  I should have told her what was happening at home. Being mature and rational was a matter of life and death.

In middle school I was want to say I was bullied but it went so much further than that. The things that were done to me..it was really bad. My parents knew about the bullying. They would go to the school but nothing was ever accomplished. Fun fact I was almost suspended for punching my main aggressor but I managed to talk the discipline committee out of it. So slowly whatever self worth I had was gone. I spent my recess time in the library reshelving books.  

As puberty kicked in at 12ish I had my first 6 year long depressive episode. It felt like static in my brain. I could barely keep myself from crying. Fun fact: I once told my mom that I didn't want to live anymore. I was 14 or 15. Did she ask questions? No. Did she hug me? Nope. I was told to never say that again. I knew at that moment I was on my own. I had to be small and not stick out or be noticeable. 

High school time! I don't know how I got through high school. I focused on my music and my grades but I could never be good enough. I was a walking time bomb of stress and anxiety. I didn't have the greatest emotional control. The people who I thought were my friends only let me into the group out of sympathy. No one liked me. I guess I couldn't blame them. It just confirmed that I was worthless.  Why didn't anyone see how bad I was struggling? 

I started cutting in my senior year. Well cutting isn't exactly what I was doing. I wasn't using objects...I was using my finger nails to scratch away skin. God the release I felt through self harm was euphoric.  I continued this through most of college. 

I did try to seek help in college through campus services.  They didn't help. It was staffed my psychology students working on advanced degrees. Everyone saw the cuts and scars. No one cared to ask. Not. One. Fucking. Person.

This is getting too long and I am nervous to write the stuff that comes in next so...hey I took a good first step.

It wasn't until 20 tears later I was diagnosed with bipolar. I resisted the diagnosis for 10ish years. Most recently ptsd was added. I don't understand where I picked ptsd but it's apparently there."

Starting my life over,18,mit6gw,4,"I've officially moved into my new place and I am just thrilled. I have seven (!!!) awesome roommates in this big-ass house and we're all just vibing and living the dream, man. I had my first sleep here last night. It wasn't a good one, unfortunately. Yesterday during the move I had a horrific panic attack that made me physically ill. I felt like I was going to vomit until early this morning. It's all worth it to get out of the abusive hellhole I was in, though. I'm free now. I'm seeing my psychologist regularly, and life is just really good right now. The weather has been beautiful, and spring has finally sprung!

I'm going to Walmart shortly to get groceries. I feel so good about myself. The only thing I have to work on now is losing weight. I think I can lose 100 pounds by September if I exercise daily and watch my diet! That's my goal. If I can lose 100 pounds and get my health back, I'll be set in life. Truly.

Thanks for reading my ramblings. I hope you're having a good day as well! <3"

Phentermine really messed me up,7,mixnnw,1,"My doctor prescribed me phentermine to help control my eating (i have binge eating disorder). It worked great at first but then I started feeling awful. 

I got horribly depressed and was dissociating and couldn’t sleep. I started self harming daily again and then I tried to overdose on my migraine medication and ended up in the hospital. Luckily I didn’t take too many (I panicked and ran and told my grandma what I did). I told the hospital staff it was an accidental overdose and they released me after 6 hours. I had to stop taking the phentermine immediately and my doctor increased my mood stabilizer and prescribed me trazadone to help me actually sleep. 

Now it’s two weeks later, and I am feeling much better. I am self harm free for 7 days. I am sleeping normally again. That phentermine really was not a good idea. I am so thankful to be feeling stable again. Thanks for listening."

Daylio Use and tracking sobriety,5,mix5e5,1,"Hey there everyone, I wanted share something cheerful and full of good news. After my last manic episode and finally stabilizing, I’ve decided to confront my demons, and begin journaling out my trauma and baggage to bring to therapy. I thought I was at a happy place, but after this episode it became apparent when I entered psychosis that it wasn’t simply true. It made me come to the realization that I have to give up drinking completely as I am utterly incapable of having a healthy relationship with alcohol any longer. 

As per tracking my moods, what are some tips for setting up Daylio? I have quite a bit of it set up, and usually remember to enter my entry, but I want to be really thorough so I know what is triggering for me, and what behaviors show when an episode is starting or ending, or just triggering behaviors in general. Thank you much!"
I don’t know what to do,6,miwiw2,7,"I started feeling depressed a little over a year ago, a few months before COVID started (fantastic timing). Eventually when I went to a check up before school started I told my doctor what I was feeling and he recommended I see a therapist or get anti depressants (I still haven’t done either of those). Recently I’ve noticed my mood swings rapidly, for example yesterday I felt really energized and pumped up like nothing could stop me but today I’ve just laid in bed and cried. I know this place isn’t for diagnosing but is bipolar disorder something I should look into? Also I was 17 when it began and I’m now 18"
Why do I keep having these reactions,4,mixpot,5,"28/F I was recently diagnosed with bipolar II and panic disorder, and I have always painfully struggled with social anxiety. I was finally put on meds a few days ago. I accomplished getting help all by myself. And I know it's going to take a few for the meds to kick in and for me to adjust, but it stills feels like I'm not being fairly supported by my partner.

I try to keep my composure, but I can't help it. The moment something unexpected happens, I feel the panic well up in my throat. It strangles my voice from the inside when I never have a problem talking and chatting ""normally"". It's painful in my neck and my chest tightens. It steels my entire body. I'm nauseous, I'm suddenly sweaty and hot even though it was chilly outside today. All my energy gets sucked away. Then I have to pretend to go along with it and not make a fuss, because the mere fact that it bothers me is weird and stressful. ""Just roll with the punches"" I'm told. When I think about the situation logically, it sounds like an opportunity for a fun time. But I was surprised this time. I was caught me off guard, thrown for a loop- ect. I was the only one who didn't know the plan, and now I'm in a tedious situation that I wasn't aware that I was about to be in and it completely fucks my ability to brain. I have a busy weekend ahead of me, I have a lot on my mind, I go to work constantly, and on my 1 day off I can't even have things half way my way. I had a fucking plan, and I'm not even allowed to have that. Whatever. I'm the petty asshole for wanting to have control over myself I guess. I'm the fucking psycho because my needs are different than ""normal"". When I have a reaction to something, I'm left to my own devices. I don't want to keep putting my partner through this, but they're at a loss for energy with this now. They're losing patience with me. They're sick of babysitting my tantrums and panicked states. I'm working SO FUCKING HARD to try to get better and be better, but I need to be told things explicitly. No alarms, no surprises."
I just don't know how much longer I can teeter on the edge of being functional,18,min5oa,7,"I'm just in a rut. I feel like I'm surrounded by people who don't remotely understand and barely care. I know I need to get back on meds before I really crash and burn but the thing is, I don't know how much longer I can do this horrible cycle. Meds until they stop working and make everything worse, then I have to stop until being unmedicated gets too bad and I need to work up the motivation to get back on meds.

Insurance is a bitch, too, and money is a serious problem. But I also had an appointment with a free psychiatrist and I fucking managed to blow that off anyway. I can't break out of it and I don't know what to do, and no one around me knows what to say except ""why don't you just get some help.""

I just feel so alone and hopeless and I don't want to do this anymore. This world wasn't made for people like me and I can't stand it. (I'm not actively suicidal or anything I swear I'm just really frustrated right now)"

Where did my flow go and how do I get it back? I need my swagger back,4,mirywr,3,"This is the first winter and spring I've been on this combination meds and dose.

Winter was actually one of the best ones I've had in a long time. I started using my light lamp about 3 weeks before labor day, around 1-1.5 hours per day. 

In the dead of winter with less sun light 1.5 hours was good, then I switched over to 1 hour when I started having trouble falling asleep.

I've had no crying spells. except I shed a natural tear or two while watching movies where I allowed myself to feel emotions lately since spring, that didn't seem to happen during winter.

 I've had no crazy manicy speech or crazy ideas like leaving my family and quitting my job. Overall most things have been good. Well except my sex drive. That has been non existent on zyprexa.

That one has been hard for my wife. It's been hard for me to deal with, sometimes it makes me want to say fuck it fine, no more meds. I've actually said that a bunch of times. But of course we all know that me on meds, is way better than me off meds. 

I don't know what it is when I'm off meds. I'm usually overly sensitive about everything. Loud noises make me heart start to jump and race. It's weird because It's like I turn into this introverted person when I'm off meds that needs to sit in a library all day just for pure quiets sake. Then I'm on meds and if anything I'm the loud one now. Laughing... super loud bellowing laughter. 

  
I become this different person off meds. When I'm on meds I'm more with at the source. I can handle loud noises, I can handle life surprises. When I'm off meds, everything is a disaster.   
As I'm putting these thoughts down, it sounds like I have a real depression off meds, which explains why zyprexa has stabilized a lot of these things for me. It's acting as my antidepressant and mood stabilizer.  Recently I stopped using my light lamp ( I don't know why, I just kinda assumed there was enough sun?) Bad idea. I started to dip into a mini depresh. When my wife and I realized this we were like DUH! So I started on my light lamp again 1 hour per day. After about 3-4days I started to gain improvements, negative thought patterns started to disappear seemingly on their own. Now were on day 12 I feel good now. 

I'm smiling again, laughing again. I can actually affirm to myself I am happy in my head without it feeling foreign or hard to say. Just before I stopped using my light lamp I was on a grind with my business. I would come home basically everyday after working my 9-5 job and I would work from around 5-8pm on my own business. That lasted probably 1-2 months. Then I just kinda stopped. I guess I'm wondering if this is a part of my illness or is it a normal person would just be burnt out and need a rest. 

There's a part of me that would like to tap into this commitment and drive and continue to work. But it seems what was just coming natural to me, just isn't there anymore. I had all this chutzpah and now I'm kinda like, oh there's HBO Max and rick and morty, that feels much more appealing. I want my swagger back. I want that constant state of flow I had for like two months. Where did that go and how do I get it back? Is that state normal, does it sound more manic? Do people have the constant ability to work on something again and again? Or is that what good habits are about?"

About a month into a depressive episode. My thoughts are pretty much a constant stream of why I should end it or how I could. I want to go to the hospital but I'm afraid.

Need help managing meds for bipolar,1,mixbdm,2,"Hello, I’m In need of dire help to manage my bipolar and or ADHD. My psychiatrist has prescribed clonidine / Trileptal to manage my gift, but I’m unsure if this will be a good combo for my issues. During my manic episodes, I have an incredibly inflated ego, increased sex drive, racing thoughts, overspending, overeating, and extreme irritability. On a day-to-day basis, I have extreme difficulty focusing, bad social anxiety, which affects my social life as I seem like an asshole in public and unable to approach women (never understood why), getting work done, and terrible memory (short and long term). Originally was prescribed clonidine (.1mg) and Wellbutrin, but this combo left me extremely anxious, empty and scared to leave my house because of this. I then was prescribed just .1mg clonidine and 150mg Trileptal but never took the combo as I read up on the side effects of Trileptal and was drawn away, so I stopped taking meds, felt great, and then began having a few manic episodes, along with occasional moodiness and still unable to get anything done, just felt like I can’t control my time per usual. I then purchased 30mg Vyvanse pills off a friend to see how ill feel off a stimulant, I was taking two a day, and I’m getting a ton of work done, more creative/productive, genuinely feeling better than ever as I feel as if I feel like myself and feeling that I can finally control my time. The only issue is that my shirt term memory deteriorated, and unable to remember words and such from the past. Today took 130mg of Trileptal and 30mg of Vyvanse and felt good but not motivated as I felt sleepy, and after the sleepyness sore off just felt very moody and on edge. So all in all, with this post, the experiences I’m seeking help on what may be the best drugs for me to help me as I’m ok with being bipolar, I want to be motivated, get work done and finally be able to sit down read a book and understand it without forgetting what I just read."

Dear RDiary,2,mirmpl,1,"March 24th 

I'm new to BP, I rather mean I've only just discovered I have it recently. A couple years ago or so. Is that a symptom of BP? No recollection of time? I've always felt I could never tell the difference between weeks ago or days ago. 

I'm still having trouble with identifying lows/highs I've got a good idea of the spirals. I believe I'm currently in one as so far I've backed out of a good friends wedding party, sent a rather hostile in my defense type of email to my boss, teetering on canceling my daughters second birthday party, and can't tell one emotion from the other. 

How does one handle this you ask? No clue. So I'm just sailing along trying to find something to quiet the anxiety. Oh anxiety, one feeling I've come to get to know on a very intimate basis. Who to talk to? Certainly not my spouse as during these tornado spirals I've beat it into myself that he's absolutely tired of me. 

Crying myself to sleep whilst wondering why there are such terrible things happening to somewhat decent people. Somewhat? I guess I feel as though I'm a decent person, I don't volunteer or donate to charity, does that make me a Villan? On the other hand I go out of my way to help others when I can, to the point where I exhaust myself in every form. My spouse tires of this quickly. I tell myself it's because of his culture, he grew up in a different world of not going above and beyond what you have to offer. Deep down I know the truth. That it's me that needs to stop. 

How does it go? Eat sleep repeat? Eat? Not so much or too much, never down the middle it seems. Sleep? I'm exhausted every day yet a quiet night in my somber bed is elusive. Repeat? Yes. Everyday feels like a copy and paste. Wake up, kids, work, home, dinner, bedtime, and the weight filled night. I always feel as though gravity sits on top of me rather then filling the space around me. Like air through my lips as I try to speak, it weighs my tounge down as though I can no longer form words. 

This reads as someone who has no notion to recollect their lost and wondering mind. Maybe I don't. Is that such a terrible thing? To be as lost as Poe felt in the Raven. Lost and found but not in a way anyone wants to be found. Does that make sense? As always questions that can never really be answered as diaries rarely ever speak.

With love, Me."
Is it ok that I really love my meds!? 😅,42,miauln,25,"Lamictal stabilized my moods like never before and Seroquel, well you know, haha, I was in the worst psychotic episode of my life, which took me out of grad school and that stuff put the fire out. I was roaming the streets for hours and coming home late at night before that. I went to the ER and wasn’t helped, it was bad.

Anyone else’s memory gone to shit?,61,mi6l8v,26,"Hello. This has been bothering me since I was a kid but I always forgot to ask or bring it up. But I have lost my memory. Ever since I was a kid people would come up to me and say “hey remember when we did this or hey we met here and did this and this” even down to showing me the picture of us and I would look at them and say “ I’ve never seen you before in my life” and the things they said I did was weird and so out of character. But again I didn’t think to much of it. 

Fast forward to now when I recently started my meds and I had to call my doctor because I had never felt that sense of awareness before in my life and it scared the shit out of me. It was like my mind had unveiled itself and for the first time ever I was mentally present. I started going through my phone and my google photos and realized I remember nothing. Not only is my long term memory gone but my short term memory is completely shot. My mom will tell me about us having a conversation or doing something or going somewhere and I’d look at her and tell her she’s crazy because that never happened. She will tell me to go somewhere for her or get something and five minutes later can’t remember anything. Or I’ll be doing something like the dishes and I tell my self I have to put my plate away only to go back and it’s already done. At one point I thought I was stupid because my parents would always cuss me saying that I’m careless and forgetful.

The worst part for me is that I’ve cut off people for things or reasons that never happened. I feel like my brain is gaslighting me and I can’t tell reality from fiction. I have proof on my phone in my messages of things that I swear in my head never happened and I’ve lost so many relationships either from lashing out and remembering nothing or remembering something that never happened and never speaking to them again. I hate it here. 

Anybody else? 🙃🙃🙃"

trouble getting medication,1,miq1dg,5,"i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder over a year ago and have been on medication for about the same amount of time. aside from the depression and mania, i have crippling anxiety. i have frequent panic attacks and nightmares and get myself worked up very often. i have gone to rehab twice for mental health and drug related issues and both psychiatrists there offered assistance in treating my anxiety, but i never stayed long enough to follow through with it. throughout the time of my diagnosis, i have been at the same practice and within that practice i have seen 3 different psychiatrists. one was great but left the practice, the other told me that she was not qualified to help me and referred me out to a rehab and said she did not feel comfortable prescribing me anything for anxiety, the third said that he would not be prescribing me anything for my anxiety because it did not need to be treated only the bipolar disorder did and when that got handled everything else would fall into place. i am taking 20mg prozac and 15mg zyprexa but i find that my panic attacks still happen. i still have trouble sleeping. the best anyone has said they could do for me is prescribe me an antihistamine, which does not help my anxiety. people that i know meet with psychiatrists and get things like valium or klonopin within their first appointment and i can’t seem to get any relief for my anxiety. i am sober and will not be abusing any medication i just need to feel better. i worry that they put something in my chart and that’s why no one is helping me"

How to deal with post-manic shame,26,mi3ko7,11,"I’m pretty new to this whole being diagnosed dealio. I got diagnosed because I attempted suicide a couple times back in February after cheating on my partner and treating them in ways I can’t even begin to explain. Apparently those couple months where that happened was my first “manic episode” according to the psychiatrist who diagnosed me. 

Yesterday night I refused to take my meds because my brain told me (not literally but you know) that I didn’t have nip lol at and apparently I got into a huge fight with my roommate over literally nothing (it doesn’t help that he burst into my room in the middle of the night and started yelling at me, I don’t respond well to people yelling at me it’s a stupid way to communicate with people)

My question to y’all is how do you deal with your actions that you are embarrassed of that you did while manic? How do you deal with the actions you committed which hurt someone you care about while manic?"

But I find that if I remove the word ""deserve"" from my vocabulary entirely, it really helps. Now if my brain tells me that I don't deserve something or if I start thinking that I don't deserve something, I stop and say ""But do I want it though?"" If I do, I'm going to do it anyway. Depression has nothing on me."

Feeling defeated. (Long post warning),3,mieru4,5,"NOT ASKING FOR A DIAGNOSIS HERE.

Hi. I'm 22, and I've been struggling with many mental health issues since I was young. I never got any sort of help until I turned 18 because my parents didn't believe in mental illness. I sought out help from different psychologists, and they all said I just have general anxiety/depression and PTSD. Well life and other things happened, so I stopped seeing every therapist I've been to. (I can't ever commit to going anyways because I feel like they aren't listening to me, and they never could give me any medications to make me feel better.)

I haven't technically been diagnosed, but my family doctor thinks that there's a strong chance I am bipolar. I told her about my struggle with my mental health a couple years ago because I was at a really low point. I really just wanted to get some control over my life. So she tried me on I think 6 different anxiety and depression medications. Nothing ever changed for me for the better, if anything changed at all, I just felt worse/suicidal. The only thing she managed to help me with was getting my sleep schedule under control with trazedone. She said she would refer me to a psychiatrist because she felt I was bipolar, and there was nothing more she could do for me, which I understand. She's just a family doctor.

My only issue is I never got in touch with anyone about this referral. So I contacted my doctor's office and asked about it, and they said they would put it in again, and someone should be contacting me ""soon"". Well, that was 3 weeks ago. In the meantime, I've tried contacting literally every single psychiatrist in my area. They all have an excuse as to why they can't take me. ""You don't have a referral,"" ""We don't accept your insurance,"" ""We're not accepting new patients,"" ""We'll put you on a 5 week wait list."" When I get put on the wait list, I wait 6 weeks, call back, just for them to say ""oops your name was never on a list sorry""

I'M JUST DO DONE! I have no idea what to do anymore. I've literally been trying to get help for almost 5 years. I can't keep living like this. I am in compete misery every single day of my life. And it seems like no one cares. No one wants to help. I don't feel like I'm meant to live a long or happy life.

Gonna try posting to a few different subs. Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now."

She is not officially diagnosed yet but she was able to give her doctor permission to discuss her treatment with me and I’ve been told she’s getting evaluated for bipolar disorder and is experiencing psychosis. She has been on a mood stabilizer for two days.

When I brought her to the hospital I promised her she was safe and that I’d call every day. She asked that I only call once a day but was otherwise very confused. 

Yesterday when I called she still seemed very out of it and was still only talking in a whisper. When I asked her how she was she responded with “what did you do?” In a quiet but accusatory tone. I told her I hadn’t done anything new- that I talked to her doctor and social worker as she’d asked and had just been waiting to talk to her. Then she said something like “my real mom” and then “I have to go” and hung up. 

I’m not sure what to make of it and I am afraid I’m agitating her. I asked for her doctor to call me back but they haven’t yet. I need to call within the next two hours so I don’t interrupt groups or meals. 

I’m just wondering if anyone who’s experienced these kinds of symptoms can offer any insight or guidance on what I should do about this call.

Your experiences with Abilify?,3,mi1qtn,12,"I've been pretty manic throughout the past few months -- not sleeping, making reckless decisions with sex and drugs, spending too much money, etc., so I was recently prescribed 2 mg Abilify. I've been on it for about 2 1/2 weeks. It has improved my life in some ways -- I'm sleeping again, definitely less manic, and I'm cleaning more, when I used to let my dishes and dirty clothes pile up for weeks. I'm more motivated to do hobbies like yoga and guitar. 

At the same time, I'm noticing potential cognitive impairments. I feel a bit anxious and wound up, when my other medications and meditating everyday basically made me anxiety-free before. I'm having a harder time focusing on my schoolwork. I'm currently writing my senior thesis. I'm super interested in my topic, so usually it's been easy to get in a flow state of research and writing, but it's been hard for me to think of the right words to say and it takes me much longer to write sentences. I'm more introverted these past couple weeks, and I find myself more drained around my friends than I used to be. I am a natural introvert, and I have been acting very extroverted this year, but I don't like the feeling of feeling the need to leave my friends when my social battery runs out. I've always been the type to only feel drained around people I don't know very well; I can usually spend hours on hours with my best friends and feel energized.

I said I'd give myself two weeks to see if the negative effects wear off, but they still seem to be there. It has achieved the purpose of significantly reducing my mania, but it seems to be triggering my anxiety and ADHD, so I'm not sure if I should stay on it. Anyone have experience with any of this with Abilify? Any advice on whether I should keep at it, or stop taking it?"
Disability benefits?,4,mhzahy,15,Hey everyone. First time posting here. I have a question. My fiancée is bipolar and in the process of applying for disability benefits because of his bipolar.

I guess my question is...is there anyone who has gone through this process and successfully gotten their disability benefits?

Would I have to give that up entirely? Again I know something small like that seems so trivial, but it’s more the ritual surrounding it. Sitting on my rooftop. And reflect on the week. Have a drink and listen to music. I guess I could find an alternative!

Also any general advice or expectations with the medicine would be great! Idk why I’m nervous about it"
Bipolar day poem: I wonder what it looks like to them,26,mhodf5,4,"I wonder what it looks like to you.

Well-meaning messages

Heartfelt hashtags.

Motivational posters.

Celebrity tweets.

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you.

The silence.

The inability to speak 

Tears over nothing.

Fears that make no sense.

Well you deal with it too,

Chin up,

Make do.

&nbsp;


Let me tell you what it looks like for us.

A fake smile we forced, a sob we hid. 

Being tired. Somewhere deep in our bones.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what it looks like to us-

That inch of hope fuelling our hearts

We will scrounge for whatever light is left,

That is who we are.

And we were not made to give up without a fight.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what it looks like for us:

Trauma, friends, family, the city, the grades, the boss, the job,

The everything that tells us we’re not,

And us,

&nbsp;

Grasping.

Trying.

Striving.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what today looks like to us:

&nbsp;

A signal flare.

&nbsp;

Shot up across a darkened battlefield.

Illuminating solitary warriors, alone, outgunned,

Making weapons out of dirt and cold and blood and heart,

And doing battle,

Against the demons.

&nbsp;

The unbeatable kind.

The ones who can come at any time.

You think you have peace, but it's a ceasefire.

Then the chains will capture our limbs,

The cell close over our eyes,

And you on the other side.

&nbsp;

Let me tell you what it looks like for us:

One more battle, one more time,

Whispering our battle cry:

Never give up, no matter what,

Fight on,

Fight goddammit.

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you, these suicide statistics.

We see fallen brothers and sisters,

We see horror that should not have been,

We see warriors who did not win.

We see war.

We see the cost.

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you:

These numbers, these rates, these implications and labels.

&nbsp;

We see each other.

The promise that we are not completely alone,

&nbsp;

Today is a single flare.

Lighting up a battlefield across the world.

Where courage and strength are not virtues,

But necessities.

And kindness is not charity,

But the only answer to horror.

Where despair can kill.

And hope is the final inch of who you are.

Where there is no retreat, no quarter, sometimes for weeks on end,

&nbsp;

Because tomorrow nothing will change for us.

The flare will darken.

The fuel used up. 

The attention will turn away.

And darkness remains. 

&nbsp;

I wonder what it looks like to you.

Exaggeration. Self-pity.

Self-indulgence. 

Florid, too long.

Yes,

It feels like too long.

&nbsp;

For when our comrades say;

“I’m too tired to continue.”

“There is no point left.”

And we see them drop their weapons.

Fall to their knees.

Watch their eyes go dark.

The demons triumphant, handing them the answer;

A knife, pills, tall ledges and unwritten letters.

&nbsp;

A part of us knows that this is how it is for some.

A part of us will stay. 

We will stay with them.

If nothing else we will stay and listen.

&nbsp;

We will stand with them.

Even as the light fades.

&nbsp;

Will remind them of who they are.

Who we are.

&nbsp;

There is a lot of cold in the world.

A cold that can fill your chest.

Sap everything you have left.

The cold of turned away faces.

The cold of insults and jeers and rolled eyes.

&nbsp;

The:

“Maybe they are right.”

“Maybe I am weak.”

But not for me,

For me,

Today is a memorial to my fallen comrades, my fallen heroes.

A celebration of those that have made it,

That make it still.

Because giving up,

Despite what it seems, is not in our nature."

However, I really don’t know if they’re the true cause of those symptoms. 

These symptoms have been affecting my blossoming relationship and I’m starting to realize how much of a problem a lot those things are. I really want to try to see a doctor or therapist about this, but I still live with my family. 

My family has not been very open and understanding when it comes to mental illness. When I first started struggling with my health anxiety and panic attacks they were very annoyed. Now, they don’t seem to understand my OCD tendencies and constantly bring them up. 

I still live with them and have to rely on them for a bit when it comes to appointments until I get my car (which is supposed to be soon) or move away (August, I believe).

Not big things, but I'll spend lots of money (maybe this was caused by getting my stimulus?), get really into something new with full passion, then drop a week later and lose interest.

Basically I don't want to manipulate my meds anymore. I've already lost my sex drive, and I know if I increase my meds I'll lose my creativity completely. What should I do? What would you do? Maybe I should just practice more discipline? Or could this be normal for most people?"

Any time I feel any strong emotion my brain goes straight to anger.

The hard part is once I calm down I regret every word I say and hate myself for it but in the moment I felt every ounce of hate that was put into those words. The hate isn't always towards that person but more a hatred of being alive. A raging anger that the only solution to is unattainable. And I apologize over and over, but you can only abuse someone so many times and still think your apology holds any weight. I'm full of blind rage all the time. Existing is excruciating and makes me want to fistfight whoever put me in this fucking torture chamber that is existence. I just get fucked and fucked and fucked by everyone that has the opportunity and at this point it seems like the game is designed for me to give up, for that to be the most logical option. The only way to win is not to play the fucking game."

I'm currently in a depressive episode where I've been crying for six days straight, wanting to die and being genuinely afraid to go near anything sharp. I tried reaching out to my psychiatrist but she won't change my pills, told me not cutting myself shows I have control so it's not serious enough and I need to learn to cope with wanting to kill myself. Why do I take these bloody things to still feel this way AND get the awful side effects? Again, I know realistically it's for the better but I'm venting."
How do you get people to give you space while you're recovering? (without outright saying what's up),4,mho8z3,3,"I believe my Bipolar and BDP combined in a sort of ""eclipse"" and I got so bad recently I had a psychotic episode. I'm still adjusting to the prescriptions and I don't feel comfortable with other people yet (but I don't want to tell them why), because I'm afraid it's only been days and doesn't mean everything is solved. Because I'm so alone and isolated my circle is actually my friend and their family, and I think they are picking up the vibe that I'm not doing well, but I really don't want them to know what's up. Assuming COVID doesn't lock us down again and everything is taken out of my hands (which would be a good excuse), how do you deal with this scenario? I mean I literally have only just had 2 days of ""okay"", but I tip so easily and quickly, I can't even say this is it yet..."
I got approved for ketamine treatment today!,27,mhdzon,11,"There are very few places that does ketamine treatment in my country. I had to go through an interview and everything. Two hours of going through all my medical history. It was exhausting. Especially when talking about the sexual abuse from my childhood and my PTSD symptoms. But I got through it. And I got approved! That was not a given at all. I was SO nervous. I was sure I was going to be declined. That my issues weren't bad enough. But they basically said I was the perfect candidate. They especially focused on my anxiety problems.

I am both excited and nervous. I have tried so many treatments. So many drugs that didn't work, stopped working, made things worse or had too bad side effects to be worth it. So I thought ""Fuck it! I've got nothing to lose by trying."" and sent them an email on Sunday. They got back to me in less than 48 hours and scheduled a video interview already today. They're getting back to me next week, after the Easter weekend, to set up an appointment for the infusions.

 I'll be going through three infusions over ten days and they want to coordinate with my psychiatrist for followup talk therapy. I'm not sure how she feels about ketamine treatments. It's still kind of controversial over here. But I'm an grown ass man. I have the right to choose what treatment I accept so fuck that. I'm going to try."

Psychedelics and bipolar?,4,mhm4t3,17,"Hey guys recently diagnosed and started taking anti psychotics and mood stabilizers and was curious if anyone on here has taken magic mushrooms or acid while taking these types of drugs? I used to to take psychedelics about every 3-4 months and I almost never have a bad experience. I find it cleansing and love doing it while in nature and don’t want to have to give this past time up, but I am nervous about how they may interact with my new medication."
Take your meds it's worth it :),22,mhdb27,11,"Really guys take your meds and don't give up!

I've been taking

* **Lamotrigine** 100 mg 2x a day
* **Sodium valproate** 300 mg 2x a day
* **Venlafaxine** 75 mg 2x a day
* **Piracetam** 800 mg 2x a day
* **Olanzapine** 5 mg 1x a day
* **Quetiapine** 200 mg 1x a day

Yeah quite a lot of meds but I'm under ADHD diagnosis so it's going to be more, but look past that. Just taking 2 meds could help a ton. I've been doing so much recently feeling pretty stable and better than worse having my mood last through the whole day on a high level of productivity and feeling happy about life. Hanging out at the playground with my brother. Helping out cutting wood, working in a mobile truck tire changing service with my grandfather. Working in the garden, playing games, playing cards it's all interesting and I actually like the things I'm doing!

It's all about getting the right med cocktail, it might take some twists and waiting but in the long run it's worth it!

I found out today that after three psychotic episodes, two hospitalizations, and countless fractured relationships as a result of my disorder during undergrad, I've been admitted to a master's of Social Work program. I'm going to spend the next two years learning how to help people who struggle with mental illness the way I do, and I just had to tell some people who understand.

I finally felt okay. I felt like the world was so much brighter and finally I was better. So why now am I crying in my bed? I just feel sad and numb. It’s not fair. It’s not fair that now I have to scramble my life again as I get out on a new sleep med, and taken off another med.

I still suspect I have religious/moral OCD. I still get sleepy at work after changing my meds. Last week I burst into tears twice (different days) while working. I have to change my meds again to combat weight gain (I can’t maintain my weight for more than 3 months). The last time I remember being actually truly happy I was manic (my psychologist pointed that out to me, said I “missed mania”). I can’t get myself to “feel hopeful” about anything.

They’re breathing down my neck about my opening my availability potentially, but I have no available energy left for any additional days on my schedule. Also my manager didn’t seem to fully grasp that I’m having manic episodes and need to go on medication/ maybe the hospital in the near future, thus compromising or limiting my ability to socialize and perform on some days. It was kind of disappointing to hear her reiterate all of my ongoing mental dialogue regarding my insecurities with my work performance as she told me my illness wasn’t a problem at the same time. But all of the things my manager wants me to work on are things I need to develop for myself first through therapy and will take some time so I’m not sure how I’ll meet those goals... All I want to do for myself is treat my disorder, learn how to grow and maybe/possibly thrive, and then use the tools I have to better myself for my greater good, but with all of my other obligations I just simply don’t see how I can satisfy or even please both obligations.

Filipino American with Bipolar Disorder Dealing w/ Family,2,mho03s,2,"I am Bipolar and have known this for the past 5 years already. Ever since then I could feel the feelings of shame my parents have on me. I remember as soon as I found out with my dad that I was Bipolar, one of the first things he told me was to never mention my illness to anyone and that I should keep it a secret. Another thing that happened a year after finding out about my mental illness was that I admitted to them that I am an atheist. I've tried my best to believe in God, but the after hearing all these stories from the Bible never added up to what I've been learning from Science, and honestly if I had to choose between the 2, I have to choose Science because Science always has proof. So that right there adds more reasons to the shame bucket my parents have on me. I guess this is just me venting to the world about how I feel to be a Filipino American with bipolar disorder. Are there any Filipino Americans out there who have been dealing with my personal problem? I just want to know I am not alone. All the Filipinos I know of seem to be proud of the culture they come from except me. So if you feel the same way I do, please express it here and provide me with details on how you cope with your problems."
How not to become manic when looking for a date?,13,mhd1ye,3,"Title explains it. I haven't been intimate with anyone for almost three years now.

Honestly, I am having a very hard time coping with this diagnosis. My brother is bipolar, and I always felt that his mood swings were much more severe than mine. I’ve always thought mania was categorized by long term mood swings, but my moods seem to change on a daily basis. One day I’m feeling euphoric, spending lots of money, high energy, social, etc, while the next day I’m depressed, severely anxious, panic attacks, suicidal, etc. I was always under the impression that mania fits tend to last longer (such as a week at a time)? I guess I am just having a lot of trouble accepting that I am bipolar. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I feel so horrible about myself right now for the emotional toll I’ve taken on my friends and family, and I just don’t feel like I’ll ever get better. Thanks for reading."
lamotrigine and aripiprazole question,1,mhq7kd,8,"i've been on them for about two weeks now and instead of my regular depression episodes, i've just been pissed off. i haven't been crying as much, but i would be surprised if i didn't fracture my hand yesterday in a violent episode.

has anyone else experienced that? i brought it up to my psychiatrist and she didn't seem concerned but i wanted others opinions... if i'm not depressed, clearly the aripiprazole is doing its job ig? and i'm not sure if it's that or the lamotrigine i'm having this reaction to...

i know both can cause aggression, but is *violent* aggression normal? i've had breakdowns three times in the past week where i've hit something until i couldn't anymore (again would be very surprised if my hand isn't fractured) and if someone was around during one of my episodes, they'd 100% be the target of the rage whether they did something to trigger it or not.

i've also been very tempted to start cutting again during these anger episodes, luckily i've resisted that urge, but probably only because i couldn't move my fingers 

(for clarification, we're not sure if i have bipolar 1, bpd, or both. my symptoms all point to both though so i'm not sure if that'd effect anything. i'm used to having violent thoughts but i'm not used to acting on them)"

Okay, now on to the sad shit.
As most of you know by now, I lost one of my best friends to suicide 6 months ago. This wasn’t my first funeral, or my last. Even in the 6 months since he’s passed, I’ve been to 2 more funerals. I started writing this song shortly after Zach’s death. And it took me over 4 months to complete, because every time I tried to write I just broke down. I could only ever write a line or two at a time. And a lot of what I had originally written ended up getting scrapped because the reality is, 4 minutes could never be enough to say everything I want to say. 4 minutes could never be enough to tell you how beautiful of a person Zach truly was, or how much he meant to me. But 4 minutes was all I had, and this is what I ended up with. This song means a lot to me. I didn’t even use auto tune or hardly any editing on the song at all (aside from a very minimal harmony) because I wanted it to be as real as possible. It was even harder considering how many times I started crying while recording. Which I’m honestly a little self conscious about, but it just felt right. Releasing this song is very bittersweet. I’m sad, of course. And anxious. But in a way, this was healing. I feel like this was finally a way for me to really say goodbye.
Zach, I love you so much. And I hope I made you proud.”"

question about hypomania and ocd,2,mhlicp,4,"just got diagnosed bipolar type 2 and i’m having my first (as far as i know) hypomania episode and i’m going a bit mad 

it started about 4 days ago with all of the normal symptoms, went to my therapist today after i got super impulsive and broke up with my girlfriend for no reason at all and she said it’s hypomania and i’m bipolar :/ 

i’m not diagnosed OCD but my mom is so i know what it looks like and there’s a good chance i have it as i’ve displayed symptoms in the past during stressful times. during this episode i’ve been obsessing over things from my past and feeling extreme guilt off and on and it really feels like OCD.

just wondering if this could be part of the hypomania or if it’s something else?

Does anyone else have both illusions of grandeur and self hate during mania?,13,mh9rma,5,"I read a lot about illusions of grandeur and feeling like a god during manic phases.

I certainly have some of this but my manic episodes are often characterized by this overwhelming feeling that I have utterly wasted my life and I hate myself for it. I do feel like I am a genius and absolutely  smarter than everyone else around me but at the same time I get irrationally angry at myself for not going to a prestigious college or moving to a larger city or working for a more high profile company etc.

Sometimes I can utilize the manic energy to really be productive and I’ll lock myself in my room for months and work on my programming skills, reading research papers etc and  really do emerge from mania for the better.

Other times I just have this overwhelming feeling that I need to get out of my city as quickly as I can and that everyone around me is stupid and not doing anything to better the world and completely alienate myself from my friends because I think I’m better than all of them. I essentially have months long panic attacks that prevent me from actually doing anything productive and I end up just obsessively looking at jobs in other cities and daydreaming about life in a big city where I am working for some company that is solving cancer or sending people to the moon.

Obviously there is an illusion of grandeur but it is so intertwined with self hate and anger at my life decisions. Just wondering if anyone else experiences similar feelings during mania or if or if most people truly feel euphoric and like a god."

Depakote brain lag?,1,mho4az,5,"I’ve been on 1000mg Depakote daily for about 6 days now and I’m having the worst time. I am nauseous all the time and feel like my brain takes a moment to catch up with my body, especially when I turn my head quickly.

My Psychiatrist simultaneously had me come off of Effexor XR and Welbutrin so I can’t tell if what I’m feeling is from withdrawals or the new medication. I have a follow-up appointment scheduled but wanted to see if anyone else experienced this and if it went away eventually. I just want to feel normal again. TIA <3"
That time of the year... anyone else?,25,mh40zb,30,"I always noticed that the time of the year when we enter daylight savings time and usually comes hand in hand with a beautiful hypomanic episode. Anyone else experience this?

The worst of it all is being on meds, being aware of what is happening and that we are entering that phase, notifying best friends and closed ones and no one seem to do anything, or they simply don’t know what to do.

I’ve been on lithium for close to 2 years and that was the time I had my last hypomanic episode. Lately I’ve been feeling the same and my brain starts screaming “go party”, “go do drugs”, “sleep less”, and so on... 

This is basically a venting post but also want to hear who’s with me, and what tips you give. They tell me to go sleep on time and go for walks and eat healthy but it might be a tiny too late for that. They also suggested putting me on abilify but I think it only works if you are not in a hypomanic episode."
Shifting gears from manic to depressed,2,mhk7y3,1,"Ya know when you finally realize that you’ve slipped into a depressive state and it’s like your actions finally make sense again? I’ve been feeling so off the last few days and have attributed it all to work stress (I teach 9th grade math). I got home today from teaching and immediately got in bed and about an hour of watching mindless YouTube videos later it finally clicked in my head. I’ve been running on mania all year and coming down from that and moving into a depressive state has fully exhausted me- but I’m glad I have more context for my actions and feelings now. 

An addition: I’ve never posted in this subreddit before but feel I should mention that I do attend therapy but am not currently medicated as it increased my su*cidal ideation too much. The brain chemistry of my mind is better left as it is and I fall on therapy to give me to tools to live with what I’ve got."

Dealing with the subtle (or not so subtle) grandiosity that comes with elevated mood.,2,mhhefs,3,"As many with bipolar can likely identify with, as the flowers emerge and blossom, so does my mood.

This is pleasant, wonderful, and natural, but for myself with by bipolar, this means being caught off guard by the quirks that suddenly arise with this. The springtime lift in mood is normal, but the “oomph” I experience behind it is not.

This is inevitable, come spring, for me I find. Aside from any sickness or illness that has emerged from my bipolar mind in the past, I find my mind just works differently than people whose mind does not function like mine. 

As this happens, I find people misinterpret any amount of grandiosity I may experience. Maybe my girlfriend thinks I’m being cocky. Maybe I act like I know better. Maybe people think I am full of myself, judgy, condescending, etc. With no foundation I may feel like I am particularly brilliant. Usually, it’s subtle. Subtle enough that people don’t pick up on it being abnormal, but instead take it the wrong way.

I can’t always maintain complete awareness of my behaviors nor analyze exactly how things come across when I say them, before I say them. But I do my best. I feel guilt and shame when I realize that I am coming off grandiose in a way that someone interprets in a negative way. I feel like a fool.

Humility and spirituality are wonderful at helping me manage this specifically. Much of this is normal aspects of the human condition that get tweaked in the way they are expressed due to the sudden elevated mood.

I feel frustrated, as aside from the illness that often comes along with a bipolar brain, my “spunky” brain just generally functions differently than most, and most don’t understand that or what it means.

Can others relate? How do you communicate these things to others who don’t notice or fully understand these subtle (or not so subtle) behaviors?"

I'm just curious if anyone else has had this issue and what their resolution was if any. Lamotrigine does so, SO well for me literally everywhere else. It saved my life, and I can't imagine coming off of it. But I also can't imagine walking around with painful breasts and having to essentially milk myself to find relief. I'm at a crossroads.

Microdosing psilocybin,5,mhb30q,4,"Does anyone here have any experience with microdosing psilocybin, mainly to improve general mood and increase emotional stability? (I’m BP2)

I have talked about it with my therapist, who has no experience but promised she would contact colleagues to get a bit more insight. 

While reading up it has become clear that mixing with SSRI’s and/or amphetamines or recreational drugs is not a good idea. 

Would love to hear your experiences."
Why is 100mg of quetiapine more sedating and calming than 200mg?,2,mhfpcy,12,Wondering why I’m not tired if I take a 200mg tablet but I am if I take a 100mg tablet. I fall asleep in minutes with a 100mg. Not the slightest bit tired when I take half a 200mg tablet or a full one. It doesn’t make sense!
Birth control might have F-ed up hormones,2,mhexul,4,"Hi I am new to this subreddit :)

I just started talking 100mg lamotrigine less than week ago. Beforehand I was taking 50 and felt pretty good, no crazy ups and downs and was able to get some schoolwork done (my bipolar is comorbid w ADD which makes shit really hard). About two weeks ago though I started the patch which is a hormonal birth control method. I think I made a huge mistake. I know that hormonal changes can trigger pretty bad episodes and I think thats what I did. I think I fucked up my hormones bc as soon as I started using the patch I started feeling like my old self again: extremely irritable, hard to control my emotions, unmotivated to do any work, unable to focus, crying for no reason. I took it off last night after not even two weeks because I just couldnt take it. I was doing so well and now I dont know if I just have to deal with a whole depressive episode (my depressive episodes last around 3 months) or if I will go back to normal soon. It also doesnt help that I wont be able to talk to my psychiatrist for another couple weeks and my parents cant find out I went on birth control. Does anyone have a similar experience? what should I do?"
How can I help,2,mhej9r,2,"My SO is not on any meds. She was prescribed seroquel and took herself off it after three weeks because she didn't like the side effects. I'm so worried. She's been depressed and is pulling away from me and her friends recently. She started a new job with a long commute so she's driving 2 hrs in the am, working, and then another 2 hr drive in the evening. All she is doing is sleeping. We don't live together, so that makes things even harder. She stopped calling and texting completely. She said she doesn't have any time anymore. I get that to an extent, but a 30 second text to say goodnight can't be too much, right? Even when she's in the bathroom? I know she has time then. I'd be there in an instant if she'd let me. To make her dinner or help with laundry. Anything to make her days easier. But she won't let me. She won't even answer my calls. 

I'm just lost and it hurts so much to not be there. So how do I help her? I'm sending a text in the am and pm to let her know I'm here for anything. What else can I do? I won't just show up at her place because that would not go over well. She lives with family, so I know she's not alone completely. I just worry. A lot."
Having bad latuda withdrawals,2,mhegnf,5,"I take 80 mg and I accidentally missed 5 days, then the doctor told me to continue at 40 mg. I've been doing that for 3 or 4 days. I feel like crap. I can't think. It feels like I have brain damage. I'm so pissed off and irritable. My brain is zapping. I get waves of depression and hopelessness. Much like when I first started taking it and wanted to kill myself 3 or 4 times a day. My brain is f$#*ed. Is this normal? I feel slow as hell. I'm incapacitated. So ticked off right now."
Increasing lamictal question,1,mhi3ze,8,"I'm on 150mg lamictal and 150mg Seroquel. I've been feeling low key depressed pretty much constantly but no episodes. I'm considering seeing if I should increase. My pdoc always says to adjust it things are ""affecting my day to day"". I don't know. I could be happier. I haven't had side effects for the couple years I've been taking it and I know higher doses means more side effects. What have your experiences been?"
Close family member died,6,mh5hhu,4,"He was a good guy, loving, caring, funny, and I loved him, but I feel nothing, no sadness, no pain for his death.  I’ve never felt the way others do with the death of others.  It doesn’t hurt me, doesn’t give me the “normal” reactions that others have.  It makes me feel like I’m broken to not feel anything.

Happy World Bipolar Day! Let’s pay an ode to the fabulously flawed...,45,mgvodx,4,"The celebrities, the rockstars, the singers, the writers, the artists,the geniuses... basically everyday people of all walks of life and class.

This is not a day just to acknowledge the existence of an illness... but a day to celebrate those who share our experiences and their lust for life. This is the day to embrace our battles, our successes, and our demons. Please accept yourself for who you are and educate yourself about the disorder to understand and get to love who you are as an individual. Not an “illness”... not a “psycho”... “whacko” ...”sicko”... or “insane.” 

Bipolar disorder does not define a person. A person can live day to day with a disorder and still be successful! 

Here is a link to some notable people who have BP and  did incredible things in their lifetimes (Ik lol Wikipedia, there are other legit sources but I found this one to be the most convenient:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_with_bipolar_disorder

This list includes famous people who share our disorder but still were able to express themselves in such ways that some of them left behind a mark on the world. Celebrities such as Carrie Fisher, Kurt Cobain, Robin Williams, Winston Churchill, Vincent Van Gough (btw, Happy Birthday Vincent!) and many others are mentioned. 

ALWAYS REMEMBER... there were many greats through-ought history who had bipolar disorder and used it as a drive to fuel passion. Having a disorder or mental illness does not mean you cannot be great. Nobody has to accept you but yourself. Validation does not come from a desperate need to be accepted. Validation comes from within. Be good to yourself when nobody else will and love yourself for who you are. 
These are the many lessons in life I have learned since my diagnosis of BP1 and ADD 3 years ago when I was 16. I am now 19 and didn’t believe I’d get this far in life or even be alive. Sometimes our hearts hang low but we gotta stand and fight for our will. We are all fighters in this battle but can’t be shattered with a heart of steel. 

STAY SEXY MY FRIENDS!

Working in a call center,5,mh7tyj,4,"I have bipolar disorder and like everyone bipolar person, I have my good and bad days but I’m hanging in there. My biggest problem is that I work at a call center and I totally hate my job like I would wake up every day and I would rather to die and not go to work and I just can’t leave cause I’m in debt and I won’t be able to pay the bills if l left. Has anyone had a similar experience and How did you overcome that ?"
Rapid Cycling?,6,mh491r,3,"Three nights ago, I didn’t sleep. My mind was racing with thoughts of elation and moving to San Diego. Yesterday, I stayed in bed all day with depressive thoughts, sleeping 20 hours.

I’m concerned. I believe my anti-convulsant needs to be raised and my anti-depressant needs to be lowered in order to stay functional.

I was able to work, I was able to avoid any outbursts or disruptive behavior, but it’s still troubling me.

Does anyone have experience with rapid cycling? What does it feel like? What do you do to smooth out the abrupt and intense highs and lows?"
Constant anxiety attacks after trauma,3,mh6l25,3,"Saturday night I experienced a very traumatic event. Normally I get maybe one anxiety attack a week that requires a Valium. Since Saturday, I have had 1-2 per day. Sometimes I wake up out of my sleep with my heart racing and having an anxiety attack, which I have to take a Valium in order to make it stop and go back to sleep. 

I am not comfortable taking benzos this frequently. How can I stop these anxiety attacks from happening? Or lessen the severity? Is this PTSD?"

Looking for Cymbalta success stories,1,mheq7a,3,Just started my first dose of cymbalta (also been taking abilify and lamictal for a while). EXTREMELY anxious right now and worried. Has anyone taken this before? If so was it positive?
"Hypo-depressiveness, Obsession, and Emotional Anorexia",6,mh3xt9,4,"These past few weeks have been an escalating play of hypomanic behavior in three acts. I've seen these patterns before. Thankfully because of meds and therapy, I'm better equipped to handle them. But the usual signs come out. I become a workaholic, sleep less (<4 a night), then a hyposexual state with an increased need for sexual gratification.   


This is particularly tough because I'm a Sex Addict (Step 6 Gang, woo). So I've been in contact with my sponsor on a daily basis to be accountable. However, I also have a fairly obsessive personality. It has helped me in the past by fueling my drive to further my career, but I would say that it's caused more harm than created any good.

Thus, I enter into the predictable downswing after the rising high. I've felt withdrawn, anxious, and lost. This morning I walked right by a coworker without a word and they got a little offended. My head has been so busy with a lot of conflicting thoughts, especially about my gender identity and career path. You know, everyday life problems. The kind that I can't stop and process because I never get a moment alone unless it's at work.   


But I've found myself hiding away in my obsessions. vTubers/ Youtubers, a few games, some stories I've been binging on, even making little bits of money on Prolific. I really noticed it when I went to check Reddit and Twitter and I had seen, upvoted, and/or commented on nearly every post on my timeline. I was refreshing and looking for something to hold onto. Something to push back the swelling darkness in my head.   


Then comes the truly negative thought amidst all of this. This feeling of panic when I catch myself in an obsessive spiral. This awful thought to cut it all off. Stop consuming things that I enjoy, uninstall apps, pull away from online friends. Starve the obsession until It goes away. This isn't so unfamiliar to me, thanks to therapy and recovery I have identified that this is a consistent pattern in my life. ""Purging"" as it is called, or as my sponsor put it ""Emotional Anorexia"". This need to feel cleansed when you experience a crisis, that the only way to feel whole again is through starving the self of joy. It's self harm in an emotional and mental sense. I've got plenty of traumatic mental scars to prove it.

Does anyone else go through this? See these same patterns in your life? Or at least that someone might kind of get what I'm going through? I'm reaching out to connect instead of cut myself off. This subreddit has been a pillar of strength for me for a while now, and I want to add my own experience to  the dialogue here.  


Thank you for reading."
Anyone else have to speak formally to hide mental quirks?,14,mgyqhb,8,"Tldr: It’s hard to find words and keep up a playful conversation.

I have a bad case of adhd, and moderate bipolar. Every since I was younger, everyone always thought I acted much older than i am. When I got neuropsych testing at 14, my verbal reasoning was 96th percentile, and processing speed 8th percentile.

Basically, I can think good, but I receive and process information very slowly. Mood stabilizers certainly haven’t helped with that.

If I try talking casually, people can’t understand what I’m saying, or I end up saying something I shouldn’t have."
"How to give ""support"" to a friend with bipolar 2?",8,mh271b,9,"I don't have bipolar myself, so if this is insensitive for this sub, please forgive my ignorance, and I'll happily remove it

So what does ""support"" from a friend look like from your perspective? Is it a stable personality, or accommodating the bipolar fluctuations, or what? My friend has said before that they like to have their feelings validated when they're upset, but I'm actually the opposite (the ""punch me in the face with the truth that I'm being dumb and let me deal with whatever hurt feelings accompany it"" kind), so I don't know how to validate something without trying to get to the bottom of _why_ they feel that way and then try to find ways to fix it. I also don't know how to validate some of the more extreme feelings without simply attributing it to bipolar and inadvertently diminishing it.

I know it differs person to person, but I'd like to hear your different ideas of what you like to see as support from a friend so that I'm more informed."

What a day,6,mh0yil,3,"So my day started out alright. I got a rejection email from a job. Okay, whatever I'll just apply for 5 more jobs. I get therapy and I'm talking about how my dad said ""why did you let yourself get so big"" and the resulting fall out from that. I have not forgiven my dad. I talk about some of the issues brought up in therapy with my mom. Okay, keeping my distance from dad. I go and start cooking dinner for my family. Dad comes in the kitchen while I'm cooking and turns off the water when I'm right about to use it. I'm already mad about yesterday so I'm pissed and say ""get out of the kitchen"" he responds by saying ""shut the fuck up"". I go splash some water on him and start yelling who knows what.

I ended up packing up all my stuff. While I was packing I said, ""how does it feel to be abusive"". My mom talked to him and apparently he was willing to go stay with his sister but like fuck him I was already halfway packed, he didn't stop me before and he only did it out of prompting from my mom

So I finally returned to my apartment. Even brought my cat back.

Drive wasn't bad thankfully.

I get back and go hang out with my friend and then we play a video game that reminds me of a fall out I had with a gym I just feel energy suddenly drained from me. 

I go back home and I'm getting ready to eat my latuda snack while all ruminating over this gym thing and then they email me at freaking 1 am.

So I responded and we'll I'm all freaking wired and I can't sleep. Probably could if I ate enough to take latuda. But now I have to start the latuda snack all over because it has been too long since I stopped.

Why did I let myself get so big?

Because I'm fucking bipolar, which on top of not having energy to exercise it also has medication that causes you to gain weight.

What's your fucking excuse dad?

Also fuck you dad, because I'm pretty sure it's your genetics that gave me this."
"It's World Bipolar Day so, I'm curious. What's something you wish people understood about your bipolar disorder?",50,mgozwq,28,"  In my case I wish people understood that depression can hit us at any time for any reason or no reason at all. We can't control our lows or our highs, and it doesn't mean we don't care anymore.  
  I also wish that I myself understood that I'm not in control either and am not consciously deciding to be low or unproductive."
Lazy Doctors,4,mh1tnx,4,"Hey folks, it turns out I *also* have hypothyroidism—maybe. 

I say maybe because off of one blood test at my first meeting with a new primary care physician, the new doc “diagnosed” me without putting down any notes about a diagnosis and prescribed some thyroid hormones. I never had the option to talk to him about the new meds because he had a nurse call me ten minutes to their closing hours to just walk me through how to take them. 

Never mind that I am *bipolar* and embarrassingly obvious about being in a manic phase when he deigned to see me for that first appointment. Never mind that I might have questions about how this will interact with my meds (the internet says no, fortunately) or my condition as a whole (the internet says yes, unfortunately). Never mind that I might have wanted to follow up and make sure that this is just a thyroid problem and not some other health issue that has secondary thyroid effects. 

I have an appointment with a new doc on the 7th. If this one doesn’t take the minimum amount of effort for personalized care, I am going to burn this city to the ground."
"Bipolar , mixed with tragety, mixed with complete failure at all attempts to rebound from rock bottom has me ready to just say fuck it.",1,mhar2b,1,"A year ago I was an industrial electrical foreman in food processing ar a company I had stock in and stayed employed for 8 years. They were pretty tolerable of my issues with bi polar, calling off, some incidents at work, the normal stuff. My father passed the day after I turned 26. After his 4 year battle with diabetes loosing both legs 100 lbs and most of his personality it was a blessing that he passed. For me not so much, I was his main care taker, changed his bandages his diapers and his blood through in home dialysis. I watched up close as he slowly decayed and fell apart. Anyways, after he passed i dropped all my meds went back to the drugs and started down the road of a 4 month bender that's hard to remember. I woke up without an apartment, without any friends, and without my 35$ an hour paying job. Now I'm sobered up and held up in my sisters spare room with absolutely no direction or clue what the fuck I'm doing. I started dropshipping but it never caught on because of all the road blocks and issues I've dumped more money into trying to start internet businesses and stuff I'm just so so lost. I've been praying for some relief, some direction some sort of purpose other than waking up just to sigh that I made it through another night alive. Every night when I fall asleep, I hope that I don't wake up, I don't want pain I don't want to kill myself I'm not teetering on the edge, I'm just really tired I'm exhausted from trying. Even know all I do is wake up sit around stare at the wall, go over my failures. Some days I try to regroup and get started on something but nothing ever works out for me. Idk what to do but I went from being the man, the guy that everyone loved and counted on family and friends, to being non existent to all of those same people and even to myself. If I disappeared, if died and my body never showed up. Nobody would even know or care. I'm sure my mom would call someone eventually after a few months maybe but I don't even know about that. I'm really not a bad person I'm an addict but I've never stolen from family and friends, they have always trusted me I've been a good person a leader and an entrapenur. But I've hit this rock bottom that I can't escape from and now that my very last business opportunity has flopped I've got nothing to live for or look forward to. I need purpose I need to do things I need to help people. Supply people with what they need to make them happy. Anything other than sitting here day after day after day doing nothing but grieving and feeling like a total loser. Fuck"
I’m pregnant and wondering how’s this is all going to affect me in the long run.,1,mhap7l,9,Hey guys so I recently found out that I’m pregnant. I’m early on and I found this out because my emotions and mood swings have been off the wall lately and then I took three test and they all came back positive af. My fiancé and me are happy but I’m deep down freaking out since this is my first pregnancy. With my bipolar I’m already an anxious mess of a person. So I’m wondering if there is anybody out there that will tell me how did there pregnancy go and how there emotions were affected by this either by them being pregnant or if you had a partner with bipolar that is also pregnant. I’m trying not to stress so much but I feel like now things trigger me even more and my emotional outburst have been even worse. I want to research some more as well because I feel bad for my fiancé who has to deal with me now being more emotional and also dealing with preparing for a child. My fiancé understands what I’m going through and talked to him about this but I’ve lashed out on him and when I would come back from a high emotional state I would feel so guilty and start crying. I’m just curious how this is going to go throughout the whole pregnancy and would like advice.

It’s so frustrating.

Sometimes I feel like the only way I could get any enjoyment out of my life is if I escaped to some house far out in nature and just watched TV and soaked in the sun with no responsibilities. But then repeating that everyday would get repetitive and I would lose joy in living again. And then I would off myself anyways.

Why am I not allowed to kill myself?

Misdiagnosed,16,mgttny,8,"Hi, guys, just discovered that I was misdiagnosed with bipolar when I actually have a dissociative disorder with psychotic symptoms. I was misdiagnosed about five years ago. All this the time, I was treated for the wrong thing. Just a heads up to you all about the possibility of misdiagnoses. I will get off this subreddit soon."
letter to my teenage self,7,mgz4lq,1,"You ran from one school from a perceived threat that *wasn't* real.  I know you didn't realize it was a delusion but you shook up your life for no reason. You come back over a year later because you realized you're too fucked up to complete that more rigorous high school program. You've been told you're smart but maybe the blackouts and catatonia don't make you feel very smart, or very lovable. People don't hate you as much as you think they do, but if you're always asking if they hate you they will start to wonder why they don't. Your family is more reliable than you think.

I'm supposed to be writing this to tell you what to expect in the coming years. Instead, I would like to press Ctrl+Z on the entire fucking script. My alterations and recommendations are as follows:

Stop running from your problems. Go see a doctor. No one thinks the way you do unless their brain is broken. No one is out to get you.

Being smart doesn't matter. Do your fucking homework. You're going to go to university eventually and flounder because you have no god damn work ethic. Please start doing your homework before you get worse. They're going to put you on these pills that make your brain feel like a swamp. If you go into the swampy-brain era with some semblance of work ethic maybe you can still learn stuff (even if it takes you five times longer).

For the love of God, nobody really cares what you do and *they're going to forget*. The people that already don't like you are going to laugh or cringe no matter what you do. Start trying to make everyone laugh on purpose instead. The people who laugh when you're actually trying to be entertaining are the ones that matter.

Your siblings and your parents don't really understand what's wrong yet. They will but they're in denial. There's family history; it's just going to take one doctor for them to connect the dots. They might not understand for a while longer, but they love you and will support you in the worst of times. Especially mum.

People in your teenage years are mean. Not just teenagers. Even some of the coaches and teachers who seemed to have gotten into the wrong profession (or maybe they're just old and jaded). Don't worry. There will always be enough good people around for you to be okay.

You're going to have a lot of fun. When you're having fun please remember to brush your teeth before you go to sleep. Just because you're drunk or having a sleepover does not mean you get to let your teeth yellow!!!

People will like you better when you're older and less obviously neurotic. It's not their fault that you're a bit nuts. People also like you specifically because of that nuttiness so count your blessings when you can. You're going to feel loved eventually, even if you don't right now. It's going to take a few years. Maybe it's your hormones? Maybe it's the fact that you kept choosing to hang out with people that gave you panic attacks. Maybe you did that because of hormones. Teenagers.

I hope you heed my advice but at the same time maybe I'm sage and cool now because you were such a fuck-up. Building character and whatnot? Don't worry, a decade later and you're still a fuck-up but at least now you don't feel so lost and afraid. Be safe. Oh and wear sunscreen in Cuba, the sun intensity is not the same at the equator you complete idiot."
"Powerless to help my bi-polar friend, help",1,mh884h,7,"Last year my friend was diagnosed with bi-polar.  I don't really know if there's anything I can do to help, but where better to ask?

For quite a while she's been in a cycle of self medicating then sobriety. It's been much the same cycle with me, but clearly it's taking a heavier toll on her. Her boyfriend has pretty much told her to kick rocks, her dad is at the end of his rope. She's like a sister to me, I don't want to cut her loose but she's starting to make that an inevitability. I finally get how my parents felt when I was on heroin.

Difficult to pinpoint when this shift in her behavior really got started, but it's been bad the past year. When she's sober, things are fine. Sure she has her moments, but she's still a very pleasant person. Just one sip too many of the booze and it's like a switch flips in her head. I can see it when it's about to happen, and I really don't know how to counter it. If I remove myself from the situation, to her that's me turning my back on her. If I try and explain how her behavior is hurting me, she just brings up messed up things I've done. If I just submit and agree that I'm a piece of shit, she will just continue to tell me what a piece of shit I am.

It always ends with me hitting my limit, snapping on her. I leave, she calls me later and apologizes. Last night was a big one. She made a comment about my luck with women, biggest insecurity of mine. I just exploded, idk why I can't control myself knowing she doesn't mean it. I told her, ""This is why (boyfriend) left, nobody wants to put up with this shit."" and once again walked out. That one was a little too close to home. To get back at me she called my family and told them all these awful things. Of course they didn't believe her, but they're totally against me seeing her ever again. I'm an adult, but approval does matter, she was a big part of my life.

This morning she called, I figured this was the apology. Nope, just calling to accuse me of stealing her vape. Not sure if she fell asleep and woke up to drink more or just drank all night. I told her to talk to me when she's sober, then hung up.

Thing is, I can't fuckin' blame her. She's been surrounded by enablers her entire adult life, myself included. Just because I enable her a little bit less than everyone else doesn't mean I'm the good guy. Her relationship with her father is not great, I'm really all she's got. Where do I go from here? I've got my own issues to deal with now, this is too much. Maybe losing me for a little while would push her to go to rehab or something, but I'm worried it'll make her hurt herself. Sorry this is a rambling mess, I'm worn out. I'd prefer a hug, but advice is cool. I hope you're all doing well."
Just looking for some virtual hugs,3,mh1oyj,3,"TL;DR below.

I’ve had my diagnosis for 4yrs now, two of which were torture and two of which I was lucky to overall stability.

A little under two months ago I began feeling myself slightly manic. Sleeping less, rapid speech, racing thoughts and an uncharacteristic restlessness. I made a few poor decisions when I began noticing theses symptoms, such as not buying and taking my daily 200mg of lamotrigine once I ran out, I decided to have a drink for the first time in the past two years, etc.

I worsened things, began buying things with my partner’s (together for almost 3 yrs) money which we could not afford. Knowing myself, I told her to keep everything in her account and give me the bare minimum, otherwise I’d probably spend it. I needed her support.

Thinks quickly took a turn for the worse in a relationship for many reasons, one of them being her inhabilita or unwillingness to try and understand what I was going through. She had seen me go through depression and mixed episodes, but never a manic one. We ended up breaking up un Friday on rather friendly terms (I could stay at our apartment until I found a place I could afford, she would even help me pack).

But on Saturday after coming home from seeing friends we got into a huge fight which ended up with her on top of me, trying to choke me, punching me, and finally, yelling into my ear “I hate you, I hope you die alone you goddamn bipolar.” The punch that hurt me the worst.

I left my house running as soon as she stopped and have been hoping from one’s friend’s house to another. Waiting for the police report to come through, getting my things in order so I can go pick up my dog...

Anyways, I’m feeling like shit. I know her aggression is not my fault, but I can’t help but think how none of it would of happened if I wasn’t bipolar. If I weren’t manic. If I had said the right things instead of letting my irritated self speak.

TL;DR Partner attacked me during a fight because she couldn’t handle a rather brief hypo-manic phase I’m going through."

I was prescribed lithium yesterday but I don’t want to start it,11,mgvfyk,13,"I’m scared of the side effects. Weight gain and acne. And me not having a good track record of ever drinking water. I’m always constantly thirsty. I never listen to what my body tells me. And I have very little impulse control. And a shit memory. Yea I could get a phone reminder. But I have at least 10 reminders a day. Most of which I ignore. I’m on lamictal with no side effects which I was hoping would be my “miracle drug”. It’s not cause I’m rapid cycling. 
I don’t feel like I would consistently take lithium. And probably not want to be on it and always think of stopping to take it. Maybe impulsively. I happily take lamictal cause there is no negative. And the one thing I know for sure is everyone always has to pee and drink water. I don’t think I will comply. 
And weight gain and acne scare me honestly cause I’ve only built up a facade of high self esteem."
Looking for advice or recommendations,1,mh68yc,3,"Hello, my fiance was recently diagnosed bipolar (Cyclothymic) and I'm hoping to find some guidance on how to navigate certain situations. For the most part, I think I do a decent job of supporting her when she needs someone to be there for her. However, sometimes I let the things that are said and done, get the best of me. I lose sight of the big picture and start blaming her for the things she's doing instead of realizing she's dealing with something that I'll never truly, completely understand. It's very difficult to find the line between being supportive and enabling. Is enabling even a factor? Is it wrong of me to hold her accountable for her actions? Are there certain things you've experienced that help you de-escalate situations? Any advice that would help me be as supportive as possible, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"
7 months clean and sober and in a bad depressive episode,11,mgtsuo,9,"So I got clean and sober September 14 of last year after over a year of hell that I caused myself. Went to treatment and immediately started working AA. I did IOP, 90 meetings in 90 days, worked my steps, everything that was suggested. It's saved my life. I've had bad days but they were nothing like when I was drinking and drugging...I've become a pretty prominent member of my homegroup and try to help others by going to halfway houses and holding meetings and hosting my own zoom meetings. I've hit a terrible depressive episode this last week. Constant crying. Sleeping. Suicidal ideations. It's been awful. It's made me wanna say fuck the program, come off the meds and revert to my old habits. I know that's not the way. I know the meds work or they have the last 7 months. I've been a little overwhelmed. I haven't had a stable job in sobriety. I've broken my wrist and need surgery. My therapist of 4 years basically said I was doing so well, it was time for me to fly and now my insurance doesn't cover my sessions with her. I've gained 40 lbs in sobriety. I've officially ended a friendship with my bff of 14 years. So there's a lot going on in my head. I went to a meeting today and ended up stepping out and crying to my sponsor. I'm in no place mentally to be chairing meetings and trying to sponsor other women which makes me feel like a disappointment. I'm not having cravings to drink or use. And I so desperately want to get back on the right track but I also just want to sleep. This sucks."

I cannot pull myself out of this cycle and I literally feel like I’m having a mental breakdown.,3,mgzup5,7,"So I recently found out that I’m bipolar and I can’t stop obsessing over it.

I need sleep so bad but moment I’m alone with my thoughts, I start sobbing. I’m currently waiting for my therapist to get back to me but idk what to do until then. 


I don’t have anyone to talk to, and that’s been super hard. The few friends I do have are still taking breaks from me after my last manic episode (at least I think this is what happened) and I totally understand. But I’m so lonely with all these thoughts sometimes that it feels like I’m going insane. Like what do I do with these incredibly fast flows of information and feelings?!

Shortcuts to life during mania,9,mgtfcn,4,During my extreme manic periods I would try coming up with ways that could make me rich and famous etc..also just generally believing I had the secrets/cheat codes to life and I knew stuff everyone else didn’t. Hell last year I thought I had psychic powers and that I was one of only a small group of people in the world that have this. Like I was in a special club or something. Luckily that was only for a week and I snapped out of it and haven’t entertained those ideas since. Still hard to believe it got that bad. I still get second hand embarrassment when I remember.

Oversharing my experiences with hypersexuality and then my complete lack of interest in sex,5,mgwwq5,2,"Get ready for some oversharing 🙃

I’ve had a couple “hyper sexual events” where I’ve:

- made it a goal to make out with as many people at the club (usually 4-6 people each night) 
- basically had clothed sex on the dance floor
- lost my virginity to a complete stranger, don’t remember his name or face
- slept with more people a week later, don’t remember them either
- exposed myself on Omegle for days without sleep
- started online sexual relationships with strangers I met online (ghosted once I realized what I was actually doing)

...but when I’m not in a hyper sexual mood I’m so turned off by the thought of relationships and sex. Men disgust me and I’M SORRY, ITS NOT PERSONAL AT ALL, I SWEAR. Even feeling the eyes of men looking at me at the gym (since it’s the only thing open and it’s the only place where I’m surrounded by others) makes my skin crawl and I want to disappear into the ground. 

I still haven’t fully been diagnosed as bipolar yet (the doctor said my reaction to mood stabilizers will tell) so I’m wondering if I’m just a sexual person and I’m in denial and/or I’m overreacting. I definitely have depressive episodes but it’s harder to point out hypomania.

I just think it’s weird since I’ve never had a crush, never truly desired to be in a relationship (meaning I never put myself out there), I don’t even have any male friends since no guys ever even seemed to like me platonically...and then I lose my virginity to someone I spoke to for 5 minutes on tinder. I just don’t think it’s adding up...but my friend says I’ve just been having fun.

I’m so in war with my own thoughts because my friend is telling me to not to put myself in a “bipolar box” and psych myself out and give myself symptoms, and then a doctor is telling me I might me bipolar, and here I am definitely thinking I’m bipolar one minute and then doubting everything the next. 

I’m so hung up on remembering my past so I can identify manic or hypo manic symptoms, I feel like I have to “prove” to my doctor how shitty I’m feeling since it doesn’t seem like they’re understanding, or maybe that’s just me overthinking his words. Idk why I’m so (for the lack of better words) desperate to be bipolar. I guess I finally just want a definitive answer as to why I can’t just out exercise my depression, why I can’t just be ok being promiscuous once in a while, why can’t I just stop thinking negative thoughts.

I just want answers.

I’m looking for in-person therapy but I’m so scared to be told they don’t believe me. No one ever believe me."

I'll probably never get a job,6,mgub6f,7,"I haven't had a paid job in years. Seven, to be exact. In my last position, I was a volunteer and earned a measly stipend. I was fired from it. I've never had a salaried job and I am approaching my 33rd birthday next week. 

It fucking sucks, guys. I did this online grad program at a top school (i.e. it was expensive) and now I just feel like it was a huge waste of my husband's hard earned money and we'll be paying back the debt with money we don't really have. I thought it would get me somewhere, but no one will give me the slightest chance because of my huge-ass resume gap. 

My parents try to tell me I ""wouldn't want to work for those companies anyway,"" but where does that really get me? It doesn't get me a job, that's for sure. It's nice that my mom could stay home and raise us when we were little, but life is way more expensive now. My medical bills alone are another mortgage payment.

If I had to commit suicide...,7,mgs8a0,7,"I would rather die manic than depressed.

I'm more self-aware and empathetic when I'm down. I probably can plan better on how to die, and will be more responsible with finances so my family doesn't have to deal with it.  But I would die alone. I'm usually so miserable people aren't too fond of me during these times. It's too sad.

However, a selfish part of me wants to die manic and paranoid. Not caring. Immediate relief. A legit concern I have is making a dumb mistake and living with the consequences because I didn't aim or calculate right. But at least when I'm manic, reality is distorted. I'm the fun friend, people seem to like me and it's a big happy middle finger to some cause."

Can hypomania fluctuate?,5,mgrt4t,9,"Can a hypomanic episode vary in intensity, even to the point where some days you almost feel normal (but still a little “up”)? Since I started Abilify I’ve been all over the place. Consistently elevated/energetic above my baseline, but my sleep hasn’t been bad every single night. Most nights I get around 4 hours, but sometimes I get 0 and sometimes I get a full 8. Im also painting and sewing and knitting and posting on Reddit way more than normal and I’ve had no appetite and those are normal signs of hypomania for me but it could just be side effects. 

I’m seeing my psych tomorrow, I’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. I don’t know if I’ve been hypo for two months or if it’s been on and off or what could be going on. Usually it accelerates really fast for me and I stop sleeping altogether for a consistent period of time so this is unusual for me."

Now i understand that is a devastating development in someones life but my grandparents the ones i live in knew she had some sort if mental illness. At first we thought it was adhd or ocd but about 2 years ago when she was sent to a behavioral hospital during a manic episode she was finally diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychotic manic breakdowns she was immediately on the right medications to make sure she was stable she moved in with me and my grandparents (her parents) to make sure she wont get hurt, arrested, etc... but about a month ago she had a horrible psychotic breakdown. She attack my grandmother and broke her arm fast forward to the past two weeks. She has been off seraquil (idk how to spell it) it was the medication that fought with her pain meds that caused the fight. Now the reason it’s important is because she is really manic now but not like psychotic but she constantly jumping from thing to thing from subject to subject in fact she screamed at me for turning off a light and helping her put groceries in the car these are a few examples l and since most people here have bipolar i wanted advice. How do i deal with this? In a way that i fan both be focused on my school work   And help my elderly grandparents

I am so confused and angry AITA,9,mgm95d,4,"This happened last night and I still feel confused and angry:

So my husband and I winding down for the evening watching Star Trek. This got us into debate, whether if we found a planet like earth, with the same position of their sun, if the life on that planet would be the same as here on earth. We didn’t agree with each other lol. 

That was ok, healthy debate is great. I ended up interrupting his point of view, rude and wrong, on my part. He let me know and I apologized then we got back into the debate. While I was stating my opinion, he did the same thing. I let him finish and I messed up by saying “now that you are done interrupting me, what I was saying....” it wasn’t in a mean way or angry or aggressive. I thought we were having a healthy debate. But that took it from a debate to how I was rude and being mean, how I was acting like I am innocent and never accept when I am wrong and it is his fault. What?! I did apologize for interrupting and I explained that I didn’t mean it like that, it wasn’t in a tone of anger or aggression. I was talking with a clear and concise opinion. I get that I don’t always have a clear mind, but this was a great time because I could get a thought out and that is something I am not very good at doing for the most part. So I replayed everything from my point of view and said that I remember everything and that I was there and it was a discussion and I admit to interrupting and apologized but I was not being aggressive or upset. His reaction: “what is the definition of bipolar?” (He said it before telling me that I am seeing it wrong and that I can’t remember what I said and how I was mean when I was talking) I went to bed alone, and I figured that after a night of rest it would be fine, nope. He was irritated and said it was because I was a jerk last night and I can’t apologize or accept that I was. The fact I can remember the conversation today and the reason it went from a debate to a disagreement is something doesn’t happen often, but it does happen. 

I admit with my bipolar I can’t always express my feelings. My feelings can even change in an instant. I am the worst person to talk about my feelings, hell I avoid them as much as possible. I also know when I get upset or angry I have said things I don’t mean, and yes sometime hurtful. But sometimes, I have a clear head, I can express and remember what was talked about and what I say. This was one of those times.

Just because we disagree doesn’t mean it is bipolar talking. I can have feelings and opinions, it doesn’t mean it is bipolar talking. Don’t sit here and disagree and then bring up bipolar like it is the reason or telling me I don’t remember because of bipolar. If I have a good day it isn’t bipolar, if I get emotional it isn’t bipolar. I am allowed to have good and bad days and it not be bipolar!

I FUCKING HATE BIPOLAR!! 

I don’t use it as an excuse for when I mess up. Don’t use it when we don’t agree. I apologized for interrupting and being rude, but I don’t feel I need to apologize for anything else. He won’t apologize so it has been dropped. He has said that I am the only one that is still upset about it. 

I am."

Being voluntarily hospitalized?,2,mgviy6,5,"I was diagnosed with bipolar after a psych ward stay in 2019. I was on lamictal until last March when I went off my meds and things have gotten a lot worse. 

I notice very clear patterns of hypo mania and severe depression, last month I was very close to overdosing on pills but flushed them. I also had a bit of a psychotic break in December but didn’t go then either. I have a psych evaluation with a new doc tomorrow and am considering asking to be hospitalized. 

Does anyone have personal experience with this? I’m also struggling with adderall addiction where I’ll finish my script in a week and don’t really trust myself anymore. I feel myself slipping out of my mania into depression atm. Last month, I didn’t shower for a week and couldn’t brush my teeth. Just lying in bed all day on my phone. I’m 17 rn and failing school so it’s overwhelming for me. 

I’m tapering on lamictal and taking ability but still am unstable. Is it okay to go to the hospital just to adjust to meds and be put on a routine? I feel like I’m not bad enough right now but my suicidal thoughts a few weeks ago were so scary I don’t trust myself."

I don’t CHOOSE to be sad, emotionless, apathetic or manic, energetic, irritable, anxious, etc etc. My friend doesn’t struggle with mental illness at all so it struck a nerve, they have no room to talk if they don’t know what it’s like.

So after a particularly difficult hypomanic/mixed episode, my psychiatrist recently told me (21F) a week ago that she thinks I am some sort of bipolar, and placed me on Lamotrigine. I'm still dealing with accepting it, and figuring out which moods and behaviors are part of my ""baseline"" and which ones are part of an episode. My question for you guys is, if you already have a pretty high baseline sex drive, can you tell if your sex drive and impulsive sexual behaviors are related to (hypo)mania, and if so how?

No one likes me if they know me for long enough,3,mgnimj,2,"I know my anger and irritability contribute to it. My delusions of grandeur are obviously a turn off to people, as is my depressed state low self esteem. Not to mention anxiety. Guess I'm just that negative

I've done so much self help and gotten plenty of professional help, but I feel even my therapist is annoyed with me despite me always being level headed. I have 0 friends. 2 of my old friends added me on a new snapchat account I made within the past few days but neither have messaged me. I used to try to initiate w people but I find they're disinterested and we eventually stop talking. I've been the initiator all my life and I'm tired of being rejected. I care for people so much.

geodon/ziprasidone and mixed episode ?,2,mgpk0y,1,"so i recently went up to 80mg of geodon (actually ziprasidone, the generic), and since then, i’ve been in what feels like a mixed episode. 
i can’t find anything on google about this — in fact i only see it helping mixed episodes.
with that being said, i was wondering if this has caused a mixed episode or anything similar in any of y’all?

i’m *only* on this psych medication because i’ve been med intolerant in the past so my psychiatrist wanted to start me off slow."

A series of thoughts 
Before me
Starts off angry
Then often time changes 
Depending if I’m anxious
Or if I’m not feeling my same
I’m trying though
I’m trying 
To keep it away from my 
Eyesight 
Or line of vision
Whatever it is hmm
It’s like I’m building heavy walls
To get you away
Or very close 
You won’t get one
Without the other
Or so I tell myself
Wait.. that’s not me
Layers upon layers 
In order to find my truth 
The truth that I keep buried deep
That haunts me in my sleep
 Wake to peace 
Or atleast I’m trying
I’m trying."

Do you have questions about GeneSight testing?,1,mgthjg,3,"My mom works at a doctor's office and she mentioned to me that a rep from the GeneSight company is coming in on Thursday to talk to the doctor about the service.

Let me know in the next 24ish hours and hopefully I can get an answer for you :)

If you're unfamiliar with GeneSight, this is the description from their [website](http://genesight.com):
>GeneSight Psychotropic is a pharmacogenomic test which means that it analyzes how your genes may affect medication outcomes. The GeneSight test analyzes clinically important genetic variations in your DNA. Results can inform your doctor about how you may break down or respond to certain medications commonly prescribed to treat depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions."

Medication and pharmacy rant today,4,mgj7t7,3,"I was prescribed some anti depressants and mood stabilizers yesterday at the doctor. I’ve been very eager to start taking them and doing my therapy since things have gotten really bad lately. Well I went to pick everything up at the pharmacy but they claimed they never received anything from my doctor. The lady asks what they’re for so I tell her the names of the medication and she very loudly says “ OH! Antidepressants and mood stabilizers right?”. Everyone in the pharmacy heard which was real embarrassing. So, I call my doctor office and they confirmed it was sent over. Cool, I go back to the pharmacy like five hours later and they.still.don’t.have.it. My doctors office is closed so I waited until this morning to call. The receptionist lady claims they’ve been having issues with the electronic system so she seems me to the triage nurse...? Who doesn’t answer so I leave a voicemail.

I have anxiety amongst many other problems.  I was just prescribed Quetiapine from the V.A. I specifically asked them not to give me anything that will make me a zombie and possibly gain wait. But because I rarely don't sleep and have may have BPD they have prescribed this drug. For the people who have taken Quetiapine for a while, how did you guys deal with the weight gain?

Reality cooler than a fairytale,3,mgklh2,2,"Hi!
I'm (21M)
I've got bipolar disorder since 2013, but it was diagnosed on 2019. I don't even know I was born with this or not.
On my graduation's 2nd exam, my hand stopped to write and kinda had feeling of brain just reset everything type. I just waited till the exam ending and couldn't attend to next exam after that day. I had laid to the bed like a dead body all the time and just wanted to die. I couldn't suicide, 'cause my heart had started beating so much when I stood. All in my brain for two months was-
""So now what?! how can people naturally die fast and it can't be cure. AIDS. But where I'm gonna get the virus?! I can't even stand.
Maybe blood cancer. Yes, it's curable but if it would hit so bad, there is probability""
So I started mumbling and changing my sleeping position over and over. I even begged to my Creator to give cancer. 
Guess what. I've got hodgkin's lymphoma stage 4b. Maybe He had accepted my wish and want to change my life's difficulty to 'Death March' or it's just a coincidence, who knows! 
After the ride of ABVD, GCD, nivolumab immunotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant; I ended up on a psychiatric hospital for hypomania. They had treated me like some angels. I came back to that bed again where everything had started. But now all I want to say is; 
when the life goes bad to worse everytime that means your Creator saying Congratulations! you just level up so the difficulty a bit more!
If you don't believe in God, it's okay! Just know yourself and rule your life with positivity!

I'm really sorry for my bad English. I'm still learning. Wish me luck! I'll write here again someday."
First Step,6,mgfcml,2,"I’m 90% sure I have Bipolar Disorder. 

I had what I think to be a manic episode about 18 months ago. Became psychotic in my room after a week of not sleeping and not really needing sleep. It was so weird, I was bouncing around the place initially listening to music having the time of my life until I literally started to see demons and had bugs crawling all over me. That’s when the fun ended. I was weirdly together the whole time though. I was acutely aware of what was happening and knew it wasn’t real. I just remember looking in the mirror and thinking how is this my life? I had recently emigrated so no one close to me knew what was up or heard my distress thankfully. It was easy to hide so to speak. Prior to this I had been applauded at family events for being so entertaining when I’m usually fairly reserved at those kind of things. I was definitely “on one” for about a month. 

Bipolar runs in my family and I’ve had bouts of depression in the past through school and college. Thought it was just normal shitty feelings, until this episode happened. I’ve never had the balls to seek help for it until now. Have quite a lot going on at the moment in my personal life, so I’ve booked an appointment with the doctor for Thursday. I’m hoping I don’t chicken out of telling him last minute. Just dunno how to approach this with my family once I get referred to a psychiatrist. I know it will take its toll on them. But I feel as the years go on I am more and more consumed by stress and worry and this has been on my mind too long. It may just have been psychosis from lack of sleep, it’s hard to tell. Hence seeking professional help! Although it’s been a long time coming, I’m proud of myself for making the first step."
I’m questioning myself if I actually have bipolar 2,2,mgn20v,3,"I know I get depressive episodes for sure, so there’s no question that I have a depression at least. But whenever I get super happy for no reason, I’m wondering if I’m actually hypomanic or “normal” people also get this high rush occasionally. Or maybe getting depressed is normal because life happens. 

My mood cycle has been more stable since I have started lithium so maybe that means I am bipolar, but I can’t help stop thinking that I actually don’t have any mental disorder. Anybody feels this way? Any chance that I actually don’t have bipolar? I don’t know if this matters but I’m also really good at hiding my episodes whenever I’m with people."
Neck pain and BP1,1,mgrud3,1,"Mods lemme know if this is out of scope, but this sub has been a life saver and I’m looking for some advice.

I was diagnosed with BP1 in 2018 after the only major full blown mania episode I’ve had. Then I had a long depressive period but meds stabilized me and I’ve been cautiously weaning off of them under the guidance of my PDOC. In 2019 I added Lamotrigine to the lithium carbonate I was already taking so I could wean off of the lithium because I wanted a less physically taxing med. About June 2020 I was completely off lithium and taking 150 mg of Lamotrigine, *BUT this is where I’m looking for some answers...*

Around that time I developed chronic neck and back pain which I’m still experiencing. I’m doing physical therapy, yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and it’s manageable finally but just not gone >_<

Could my neck pain be related to me stopping the lithium?

Could there be something else going on since our bodies can be so mysterious sometimes?

I’m going to order blood work to check my thyroid and vitamin levels, and also to check for an autoimmune disease. 

Just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences or has been diagnosed as BP1-2 (which I identify with) but maybe something else was triggering it, like thyroid problems, etc. 

Currently I’m on 100mg of lamotrigine at bedtime. Any thoughts or advice deeply and humbly appreciated. Thank you :’)

Yours truly,
Miss desperate for help"

But (my first) mixed stage came and here I am.
It's just, somehow, with this, I feel like I took a step back? Like not moving forward. Always stuck in the same phase.

I tried to stick with it because I wanted it to work but I stopped taking it yesterday.. it’s frustrating. The other issue is during all this I’ve also been taking lexapro and basically by itself so my moods have been rocky to say the least. 

I see my nurse practitioner again tomorrow and hopefully get something that helps.. I just needed to vent .. figuring out meds is so damn hard and I’m usually so quiet about things I try not to bother people with my problems but I’ve just felt so bad.

Mixed episode advice,1,mggqjq,1,"So ever since starting Sodium Valproate around Christmas, I have noticed a massive change in my bipolar symptoms! Generally feeling stable, not having episodes, no sleepless nights. Up until the last 3-4 weeks. Started off having one sleepless night 3 weeks ago. Also thought I should add that i’m in the process of potentially getting a Borderline diagnosis.

The last few days I have noticed my bipolar symptoms plummeting. 3 nights ago I had a sleepless night! Slept the next night. And now I’m entering night two (in a row) of not sleeping. Also having fluctuations of being severely depressed, then hypo/manic. 

I ended a friendship with my ex a week ago and am wondering if that is potentially enough to trigger an episode? Also considering I potentially have borderline and that they were my “favourite person”, it would make sense that it would trigger my borderline/abandonment issues. I also should add that I have made another big life choice in stopping my studies! 

Despite seeking help mid last year. I am still pretty new to working out my triggers and learning how bipolar affects me personally.

I have an appointment with my psychologist tomorrow. But I just feel so alone right now! And need to rant about this to people who understand what I am experiencing. 

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated!"

And my boss was totally passive aggressive and made an announcement about being slow today AFTER she had already scolded me for taking too long. I hate this. All I want is consistency but I literally feel like slumping over and crying on the floor, much less like continuing to move when it feels as though I'm wading through molasses. She thinks I'm just being lazy or dawdling but I've never been known to do that by anyone and everyone has always complimented me on my work ethic. I've even been asked to correct other's work multiple times. But today is the day I get noticed by the bosswoman. Smh maybe dramatic but I honestly feel like saying I'm done. I know that's just the frustration and sadness talking. But still. I'm not a lazy person, I'm just not able to life with the other grown ups right now.

2. Not easily able to control their emotions

5. Their therapist and psychiatrist all say they are having a manic episode.

Diagnosed outside of US,1,mge7s2,2,Just wondering if anyone has experience being diagnosed outside of the US and then moving back. I was diagnosed in an EU country where I am currently resident but will have to return to the US in the next year and am worried about not being able to get my meds. Would a letter from my psychiatrist here stating my diagnosis be sufficient or would I have to be re-assessed in the US to continue my prescription?
Medication dilemma,1,mge5dm,1,"I'll try to keep this short.

A couple of months ago, I started getting sharp burning pains in my kidneys with chronic fatigue. I had a course of antibiotics, not much change. Got all of the tests done at the doctor. No bad results on paper.

Then they mentioned that Covid (which I caught on December 1st) can cause organ damage but it's preliminary research at this point. The chronic fatigue is really debilitating and I'm struggling to get through the day at work. I'm currently on lithium which is processed by the kidneys. If I do have kidney damage (which I suspect is the case), I assume that the fatigue will be lessened if I come off the lithium.

Having said that, if I do come off it, it will take a long damn time. First I need to wait until my next blood test (which might not even show kidney function specifically). Then I need to wait for the results. Then if I slowly taper off, it will take several weeks. I really just want the fatigue to go away now, especially since I may be starting a new job soon.

I even had the vaccine and it's not much better. In fact, the burning kidney pain is back. I really don't know what to do here."

Since I was about 12 years old I had felt this something click on. I can't tell you what it is, but I remember the time that my brain clicked on and just never turned off. I can never stop thinking, and nothing in the world made me happy to be alive for more than about 7 seconds, everything was great until I realized the thing wouldn't fill the void.

I've been a loner my whole life, not by choice. I haven't had a consistent set of friends or a friend group that I could have as a support system, or even just friends. People just never were interested in being my friend. I don't know if I'm just annoying, or if I'm not as nice as I think, but I feel like I would do anything for just about anyone in the world and when it comes down to it, no one would do the same for me. I've always felt that I have not, and could not fit in.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 18 and then one of my therapists when I turned 23 said I wasn't bipolar, but she didn't believe it was a real thing. I eventually stopped seeing her because she was not doing any good for me, and I felt as if she was doing more bad than good. 

After a little while I had started having very severe mood swings due to stressors;  I could not force myself to distance from said stressors, and I started having full blown breakdowns. I started rapid cycling and could not handle the physical toll they were taking on me, so I went to a hospital where I was admitted to CPEP. They did not commit me to the hospital, however they did diagnose me bipolar II and referred me to an outpatient program. 

The outpatient program involved therapy and medication and the psychologist and psychiatrist worked as a team to assess my needs and prescribe and set goals to help me through this. From the beginning the psychologist was absolutely unprofessional: Doing things around his apartment, fiddling with his microwave, went grocery shopping while we were in a session, was doing other work in sessions, just to name a few things. About 3 months in stopped contacting me entirely, and I wound up looking elsewhere for a psychologist. about 3 months after no contact, he texted me asking if I was available to talk, however, after 3 months I did not want anything to do with this outpatient program. 

The psychiatrist that they gave me through the outpatient program was an RN and was absolutely wonderful to work with, however, I decided to stop taking medication when it stopped doing anything for me. She insisted that anti-psychotics were what I needed to be on, but according to my therapist, mood stabilizers are way better for bipolar II. I decided to stop taking medication all together because I have had so many failures with every medication in the book.

In January, my life was flipped upside down. My grandfather died, I had to move out of my apartment and move back into my parents, and I decided to give up on my dreams to become a professional musician. Prior to this year, playing the bass was the one thing that could calm me down over anything else, it was the only thing I was that good at, and it had become one of my obsessions. I decided that working for my father would be a better option. He is an electrician and owns the company, so one day I can take over the company and have a nice financially stable life.

My father does not believe that bipolar disorder is a real thing. He constantly tells me ""everything is going to be okay; you don't need to worry; it hurts me to see you like this; the next step is going to the hospital (he's not aware I went 9 months ago); stop being a pussy; buck up; be a man, you're 24 years old; etc."" He embarrassed me in front of my aunt and uncle and when I got upset with him he understood I was upset, and then as soon as I told him I was upset about that started yelling at me. He paid my way through college, bought me a car, and did a million other amazing things and as much as I love him for doing those things for me, he likes to throw all those thing into my face and makes me wish he never would have done anything for me. Now that I work for him we carpool as the commute is 40 miles over bridges (so gas and tolls), and he won't let me drive myself even if I were to pay my own gas and tolls.

I can't stop the thoughts racing through my head. I can't stop constantly thinking the world would be better off without me in it. I can't stop thinking about how inconsequential my life is. I can't stop thinking about how once I'm dead, I will have not made any difference and I will be forgotten within 3 years. There's never going to be something that I'll be recognized for, there's never something that I will do to make the world a better place. I haven't been able to get myself from laying in bed watching TV or playing video games besides to get myself to go to work, and the occasional errand with my mother. I wish I could just evaporate.

If you read all the way through, I really appreciate it. I'm just lost and I don't know what to do anymore."
Paranoia,3,mg9041,4,"I keep getting bouts of paranoia. Most of my paranoia is about my gf cheating on me. I’ve been with her for only ~2 months and I believe these thoughts are irrational. However, it is very difficult to separate what’s real and what’s not. Any advice?"
I don't even know anymore,5,mg7dkv,2,"Hey all. Not really sure to where to begin. Guess I'm looking for advice, or support or Reddit medical diagnosis. I don't really know. I'm 39 M being depressed, angry moody whatever since I was a teen or even a little younger. I'm a really short guy 5'2 and a think that once I got to the age where I started to realize people significantly judged me for that, it started a downward cycle. Only reason I lead with that is I try and think about if I had any trauma or really terrible childhood memories or anything and I really can't think of any. Throughout HS I was always a huge risk taker, in trouble with the law, and have always been a major major pot head. In my late 20s I was building some positive momentum in my life, graduated college with a CS degree and eventually got a really good job, met my wife, etc. I've always used weed to self medicate and I know that now, just using it to dull everything. Couple years back I got a medical card and then fast forward a little more and COVID hit. Started working from home, and even as a 25+ year smoker I just went nuts with it. Constant. I finally got to the point where I had a melt down. I won't get into details of that but it resulted in the hospital, terrifying my wife and after a little bit deciding that I couldn't smoke anymore. After the withdrawals of stopping weed calmed down and I started to get my ""shit together"" about 1% my general prac DR. started me on lexapro. The next day my severe depression, anxiety and OCD stopped, but I also felt like a useless lump stuck in neutral. Zero motivation for anything, work, food, sex, bathing anything just out of it. After a few like 5 months the same Doctor moved me over to effexor. Seemed about the same, but a little while in I relapsed with weed hard for several months until another meltdown. That was early Feb. I stopped smoking again and decided after about a month to get of the antidepressant too. So here I am now. If you have read my incoherent rambling so far thank you. I've always had strong and long mood swings. Like months of hating everything, zero interest in anything and then suddently out of no where about a week of insane focus, motivation, non stop goal crushing. I think I got into a little bit of rhythm that knowing if i was going into a mania phase, at least try and use it to my advantage. But since I have gone off the effexor, about a month now, I've never been more insanely irritable and angry all the time. Like x 10. My sister has several mental health issues, has been diagnosed BP by one doctor but doesn't currently take anything. We are always waiting for the other shoe to drop there though. I guess I just don't know what to do anymore. I'd just like to be a calmer, happier go with the flow type of person. I'm very blessed in a lot of ways, I try to be greatful. I hear all teh time exercise you will feel better, but it's like impossible when you're just to angry and tired. Next week I'm going to start going to talk therapy again, maybe that will help, but I feel as I get older I'm just going further off the deep end. You can webmd yourself to death, am I depressed, developing schizo or pychosis type of stuff, am I BP. I just don't fucking know. I'm sick of tired of being sick and tired. I know mods on a lot of these types of forums are very strict about what you write so if I said anything against the group I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated and want to feel better. =("

This is why the hell I am quick to make excuses/explanations, or apologize.

I do receive professional help and the  paranoia is reduced, but it can resurface during high amounts of stress. My bipolar disorder is driving this paranoia to the maximum.

I am gullible. When someone tells me something, I easily believe it. Even I tried to shake it off, my mind forces me to believe it. Even if it's wrong. To make this statement short, it's hard not to be convinced.

Looking back it now feels like I finally got a breath of air after drowning for so long. I am left with an experience that, fortunately for others, I have no words to describe the horrors of. The depression that almost killed me felt like an encounter with one of the eldritch terrors and it drove me into a madness of despair from which the only way out I saw was death. I am relieved to be past it, and scared to know it can happen again. For now though I will be grateful that I can know some sort of peace.

On a positive note...,5,mg2ceu,2,"So I was just reading some comments in a thread that typically triggers me to want to engage in conversation to share my viewpoints. I realized that I was not triggered this time in fact I was bored by the conversation. It reminded me of so many of my other obsessions that I used to obsess about and prioritize in my life whether they were toxic or not and how they would affect me but then when I was no longer obsessed anymore it had no power over me. I have realized that I get obsessed about a lot of things but only for a short time. I think about these people that continue to be obsessed about certain things especially if it’s toxic for years and years and their whole lives. I only experience it for maybe a few days or weeks and then maybe the next thing I’m obsessed about is some thing positive. I never know what I will be obsessed about next. But at least I can focus on the positivity that I’m not stuck in some of these negative perceptions, toxic mindsets, and conversations that I once was. I can just hope that with continued therapy and medication and healthy boundaries that my obsessions will continue to be healthier and better in the future. I never make promises though because you just never know. As I’ve read someone say on here before, “It’s a wild ride.”"
Does anyone else find their migraine or headaches flow along with their mood?,5,mg25br,5,"I'm wondering if people can correlate or even predict which ones come first. I am not diagnosed with bipolar, but I am still suspecting it because i have recurring depression and/or dysthymia.

I typically have 2 migraine days a week, despite being on high doses of migraine meds (betablockers). I notice that the last dose increases haven't helped or even worsened it, because I get more tired and that can trigger a migraine.

However the opposite had also happened, now that I am easing off again  Since last week I'm doing great (after 2 weeks of turmoil) and I have been sleeping less hours (5-6) per night. I didnt have a migraine ever since, where normally you could calibrate clocks with my migraine patterns (eg day of week, time of day etc)

I have had these upswing before for about a week, maybe 2. Then it returns back to normal migraine schedule. So I really suspect they are interconnected.."
First time in therapy // Is this normal?,2,mg7rh6,4,"I was recently diagnosed with BP 1 and referred to a therapy place. I had my first session tonight and it was awful. The therapist was painfully awkward. I noticed it on the phone when making an appointment with her, but I assumed that she had a lot going on that day and I didn't give it much thought. It's bad in person though... A lot of awkward silences, avoiding eye contact, stumbling over her words, seemingly racking her brain to think of things to ask me, and near the end of our session she was turning to look at the clock every two minutes. It made me very uncomfortable and made her seem incompetent. I'm going to go one more time to give her a fair chance, but I really want to ask for a referral to a different place if the therapist acts like this next week as well.

That being said, is that normal for therapy? I googled this and some people said therapists often don't say anything and pause to see if you will fill it. Is that true? Would you also want a new therapist if in a similar situation as I am? I just want to know if I'm overreacting because I don't love the idea of being in therapy as it is.

Thanks and sorry that this was kind of all over the place."

It helps me so much to focus at work and helps to wake me up. I have an appt with my psychiatrist this week to request he prescribe the med officially but feel nervous he'll probably push against it."

My step sister, Laura (not her real name) is currently having some sort of ""episode"". It started last Wednesday. She started making Facebook and Tik Tok videos playing strange music and doing all sorts of weird, what I can only describe as, hand dancing movements. She looks exhausted and her make up is ALL over the place. She's been talking about how she is a contractor for the government and that they even sent her money for all the work she's doing for them (it was her stimulus check). She said she is doing ""mind control"" for them. Her bio mom, with whom she lives, had a therapist over to the house on Saturday. They confirmed that she was off her meds and said there was nothing they could do since she hasn't threatened harm to herself or anyone else. Laura also mentioned that the therapist was also a government employee, she could tell by her ""hand movements"". I don't know if this qualifies as her just dissociating or having delusions or if she's in the midst of a psychotic episode. Either way, does anyone have advice on what we can do to help her?  


Just for context, I am bipolar as well (2). I have random delusions but they are fleeting and I've never had any sort of psychosis that I am aware of. I don't feel like I can give my usual mental health help suggestions as I have never been in this situation. Our family feels at a loss right now."

I just want him to be open and come to me when he’s having bad days. He’s super happy and full of personality majority of the time but he’ll snap to being in a down mood and I just worry about him and love him, I’ll literally get nightmares about seeing his arm when he used to cut himself I just care about him.

This feeling of goodness disturbed me.

So after my bath I told my brother (whom I live with) about my euphoric feeling, as he wanted me to tell him the instant I felt traces of mania again. He told me to go to sleep early and to take a Tamezapam if I can't fall asleep tonight...

Any Writers Out There ??,2,mg0h9h,6,"
Hey y'all, do we have any bipolar writers out there? Looking for ways to make some writing friends?

During the last school year I interned for a program where we facilitated creative writing workshops in Jails and Community Corrections, and it was definitely one of the most fun and impactful things I've ever done in my life. The writing and the conversations were so full of vulnerability and passion, it really helped me to be the person I am today. I really think it could help out other Bipolar folks as well.

So I started a weekly creative writing workshop for all who are interested! We meet weekly, Wednesday’s @6pm mountain time. It’s super chill and no pressure, we just check in on one another and do some writing prompts loosely based around a theme. So far it’s only a couple of us, but I’d love to see some new faces in there! 

Any one interested?"

Today I went for my 3rd session with my psychiatrist to discuss how things are going with the meds I’m prescibed. I’ve been increasing my dosage every couple weeks since my diagnosis in early Feb.

I’m now on 100mg of Quetiapine and we had the aim of increasing me to 125 following this sesh. Today following my chat with him, he decided to keep me on 100mg and said he’d like to refer me to a psychologist &amp; I would go back to see him in 3 months. He said that this was because he didn’t want to increase the dose every time as it takes time.

Part of me knows it’s posi that he’s keeping me on this amount for good reasons etc but I’m out of whack.

Idk why but I feel like this is just a complete unknown area for me. I know therapy is a good thing but I’ve never had experience of psychologists before and it worries me that it could trigger something in me or g-d forbid I get sectioned if I say the wrong thing.

I super rapid cycle. Depressed and manic several times a day, sometimes by the hour😞
I've been noticing a pattern lately that I have a better day where I'm still symptomatic but able to get some life stuff done. Then the next day I can hardly manage to do anything. It's literally every other day... I always cycle maybe times a day (sometimes by the hour) but the general pattern of one coping day, one bad day is consistent.
Does anybody else happen to do this? On the better day I doubt that I'm as sick as I am then on the bad days I struggle to do anything.. it's so confusing"
What do I do?,3,mfti5y,5,"Hey, I’m 15 and have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder for nearly six months now, but have been going through it for longer than that. My diagnosis originally started out as Bipolar 2, but it was changed to Bipolar 1 when I hit a 10 day manic episode and landed in the hospital after I crashed. My therapist also tells me that my bipolar has psychotic features, and on top of that, I rapid-cycle at an insane speed. In February, I had a manic episode and 2 depressive episodes for example. I guess I’m only making this post because I’m in a really bad depressive episode that’s been going on for a week and is only getting worse, and none of my medications work. Does Bipolar get worse with age? I’ve never met anyone with Bipolar so I don’t have anyone to relate to. I’ve been fairly suicidal for a while now as well, which no one seems to know what to to with that in my area that I live in other than admit you to an impatient facility. So, what do I do? I’m sorry if I’m rambling or anything like that, I’m just stuck between a rock and a hard place, and mental illness has taken control over my life."
"Lithium, thyroid gland",2,mfw3th,5,"I’ve taken lithium for about 3 weeks even though I don’t want medication, my TSH is now 6,9 mE/L when it was totally normal 3 weeks ago, this makes me very concern and I stopped taking lithium since yesterday. Is my thyroid permanently fucked up or is it reversible? And is it okay to stop meds just like that? I was completely fine before."

Anyone else on medication bonding more with others?,8,mfmysw,10,"I'm bipolar II and started a new medication (equetro) a couple of days ago and I noticed I've been bonding to others more lately. I hadn't even realized I wasn't for years (not a psychopath, have morals, still treated friends well)."
"I don't think he gets it, I hate my bipolar.",21,mfi8mf,10,"I'm [34 F] was officially diagnosed almost 2 years ago, we are still working on getting my meds to balance me out. Since then I have literally lost everything; my career, custody of my only child, I had to leave a place I loved to move back to my home state in the Midwest and this all has caused so much stress on myself and my relationship with my boyfriend of 4 years. I have days where I can't get out of bed and I sleep through the day,  this makes my boyfriend turn into a jerk, he shames me for doing nothing, he does get it. He can be very unsympathetic about my emotional needs, i tell him that sometimes when I get severely depressed just holding me or giving me a hug will make a huge difference. Usually that doesn't happen. When I'm not having an episode things are so good. I really think he is the love of my life/soul mate but when I'm manic or having a severe low I feel very alone, like he's not there for me. Is that normal? I hate my bipolar,  I feel like its getting worse. I've lost everything, he's all I have."
Does anyone else hyperfixate/obsess on things? How do you deal with it?,43,mfe4rm,17,"I was recently diagnosed a couple of months ago with bipolar disorder (jury’s out whether it’s 1 or 2) but I was wondering if anyone else fixates on things? I’ll spend hours trying to searching for a niche object or researching a detail, even if it means not sleeping. 

How do you catch yourself when you feel yourself going down that rabbit hole? It can really take up my time, energy, and expenses but I don’t know how to slow that train of thought down. I’d love your insight!"
Do Benzos make anybody else extremely manic?,3,mfrr9t,2,"I’ve never had a huge problem with benzos but have had a prescription before for serious panic attacks. A few years back when I was taking it more often I was also manic A LOT. More recently I’ve old had to use one a few times in the last few years. I didn’t think there was a connection, just that I was manic and the benzos helped to calm my system and numb my brain. 
Anyways yesterday in the midst of a horrible panic attack where it felt like I was having a heart attack, my moms voice came into my head reminding me if I’m having so many panic attacks recently maybe I should start taking anxiety meds again... So through the hyperventilating I went through my box of old meds and found some klonopine. First few hours everything was good, felt sleepy and kinda numb but okay, mid afternoon rolls around  and it feels like it’s wearing off so I decided to take another (the bottle said take up to 3 times daily) and holy shit. Not only was I high as hell but I became EXTREMELY manic! Trying to get In my car to drive away (absolutely in no condition to drive) while my fiancé physically had to fight me to get the keys out of my hands. Started talking about death. For the first time even reached out to one of those suicidal support lines (at least that was a win for the moment) 
My fiancé and best friend were so scared....she ended up calling an Uber to pick her up, pick me up, and take me back to her house so she could hold me and I could fall asleep... 
feeling a little better today other than the extreme low I feel after being manic. But now I’m really curious if there’s any connections between benzos and mania..."
Blacking out,2,mfumjw,4,"Hi I’m new here. I recently got diagnosed with bipolar after getting misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder for 4 years and am still in the beginning stages so I’m not even sure which type it is. I was put on lamictal a few months ago for a mood stabilizer and recently a SSRI but haven’t taken it yet because of insurance. I’m coming here for two things:

1) I’m scared to take a SSRI again because I’m the past it made me feel worse (before I knew it was bipolar) and I’m really fragile right now.

2) I keep getting extremely angry over something little (like my car radio not working the other day) and then crying about it. Once this happens my entire mood changes and I’m mean and just cry hysterically. It seems super severe because I get seriously suicidal and don’t even have a reason sometimes on what’s wrong. Fast forward to the next day, i don’t remember anything and it’s like I blacked out. My roommate is around when this all happens and she tells me what happened which is how I know what happens, but it seems so irrelevant the next day after it happens. This happens at least 4 times a week and it’s so overwhelming and I hate that my boyfriend and my roommate have to see it because I’m embarrassed and can’t explain what’s going on when it’s happening. My boyfriend and roommate said I don’t really make sense when I’m in that state and I’m not sure what to do because I go to college and have 2 jobs and am thinking of dropping out recently with how hard it’s been and how my grades have been negatively affected. 

Thank you in advance!!❤️"
Being tired,4,mfpidz,1,"I can be tired while manic. It’s a little like sleeping on cocaine or diet pill trucker-speed. It’s restless and not-deep sleep and it doesn’t come easy. When you’re up again it takes all of ten minutes to realize you’re still going a hundred mph. Or, like the years before and immediately following my own diagnosis... you never realize it at all, which is scarier.

Carrying my body, to a brand new Bugatti

Feeling lost with my life,1,mfy97m,2,"I took the academic year off from my grad school program due to a manic episode this time last year followed by a long depression over last summer and into the fall. I’ve been trying really hard to get back into my studies and I have a thesis project proposal due in a month, but I just feel like an idiot and want to quit. I read too slow, having difficulty comprehending and remembering what I read, and I’m full of anxiety whenever I try to write. I was so excited about being in this program during my first year but now I don’t want anything to do with it. It feels like too much for me now. I haven’t been working in over two years (left my corporate job after a horrific depression) and I really just want to find a basic job that’s not too stressful to regain confidence and stability. But if I do that, am I throwing away an opportunity by leaving grad school? Thoughts? Thanks in advance 💛"

How do I know if I’m manic?,3,mfpylv,4,"I’ve only been diagnosed bipolar a few months now. I can easily differ when I’m manic in hindsight. I’ve also had bouts of hypomania but I’m struggling to figure out what is normal and what is hypomanic. I was severely depressed with bouts of high mania for years and now I feel like I could be leveling out but I don’t know whats my normal vs what’s hypo. After switching meds I had a few days of sever mania. Then it’s subsided. I was nonstop, constantly talking, fidgeting, researching, impulsive behaviors, grand gestures to loved ones, overspending . It’s subsided for a few weeks now, I cant figure out if I’m hypo or at a normal level. I still have issues with impulsive spending. Still constantly trying to start new hobbies, irritable and irrational. How do you guys know when your not hypo? Any advice is appreciated!"
Is this bipolar or just sad living circumstance?,1,mfxr56,2,"My emotions change fast. I'm very sensitive to perceived criticism. I struggle with self harm. I'm trying to get on disability benefits. I've been homeless a lot. I have a good opportunity in front of me but am too tired, angry, uncomfortable, sad and upset to care about the opportunity."
I have a disease but it doesn't have me.,72,mf8zjv,10,"I recently had an epiphany. I've been switching meds desperately hoping to control and diminish every symptom that made me feel inadequate compared to my peers. Last night, as I tossed and turned in my bed hating myself for everything I can't control I heard a voice say ""stop resisting."" It hit me: I've been trying so hard to be normal, that I haven't allowed myself to find a new normal. I'm not like the people around me, and that's okay. I wasn't designed to live life like everyone around me. I am destined for great things, but on my own terms. This hyper-fixation on self-control is causing me more pain than this disease ever could. If I could give any piece of advice to anyone around me it would definitely be ""stop resisting"": stop trying to be normal, and start trying to be healthy and true to yourself. I'm going to struggle, I'm going to hurt, but life's a ride, and it's just part of that. I have a disease, but I'll be damned if I spend another minute letting it have me."

Messy bedroom blues,3,mfr9jg,3,I have started to slip into depression again and I feel upset that my room is so messy now and I haven't got the motivation to clean. Anyone else struggle with this? I just want to not feel so alone and guilty for not cleaning.
Does anyone else have problems with paranoia,23,mff4s0,20,I talked to my psychiatrist about my problems with paranoia and she said it’s possible it’s due to my bipolar. It can get very frustrating at times sometimes I can’t sleep cause im scared someone’s watching me. I’m also into true crime so Ik that’s most likely a cause as well. I’m terrified of the dark due to it too. Does this seem familiar to anyone ?
hallucinations and type 2,3,mfmo3h,12,"hi, I have type 2 and am not sure if I am hallucinating or not. I am in the middle of a pretty deep depression at the moment and have been seeing some things moving in my peripherals. I have thought I have seen people but they turn out just to be shadows/shapes made of trees or walls. I know that this is pretty normal but it has just been happening a lot. 

is that what would constitute as visual hallucination or just normal anxiety/paranoia about having hallucinations in your experience?"
Depressed without saddness,1,mfv5et,3,"This is kind of the first time I've noticed myself going into a depressive episode but I'm not sad or suicidal for once. I am stressed cause I don't have a job and mini life bumps in the road. Just college. 

But yeah I've been on wellbutrin for a month and that saved my life. But now I feel no motivation, tired, no appetite, can't focus, lazy, sleeping in etc again after tbh I think experiencing a week of manic episode. 

I'm gonna let my doctor know too. But I'm scared if hell up the dose, last two medicines left me in a painful spiral of depression where it almost cost my relationships and grades.

Any advice on how to push through?

I force myself up after being in bed for two hours. I eat a light meal. I shower. Do some school work and then hop in bed again for a few hours or watch stuff. I just feel unproductive. I was so energized last week."
"My boyfriend feels like he’s “suffering” with me as I suffer from panic attacks, PTSD, mania.",10,mfisai,4,"21F. TW suicidal ideation

My long distanced boyfriend and I have been best friends since high school. We were always very affectionate and supportive of each other. He’s been there for me since I was first diagnosed with depression and anxiety. Since high school, he’s picked me up at all hours of the night, stayed on the phone with me, held me.... now 8 years and much more trauma later he’s still around. Last year we fell in love after a series of breaks in our friendship. When COVID hit, I was only a year into my bipolar 2 diagnosis and had to move last minute. I became manic during the entire transition almost missing my flight. I called him one morning after I had tried to unalive myself crying that I was still living, to which he responded “that’s stupid” I got really upset at him and we fought, he ended up blocking me on everything and we didn’t speak for months. Fast forward months of tears and longing for him I realized that I was missing something much more than a friend. (I thought this could be because he was my soulmate, but maybe what I was feeling was an emotional crutch.) We eventually made up after a few emails (he forgot to block me on Snapchat) and our Romantic\sexual relationship began again...

I longed for him so much that I went to visit him, but when I was there he was very... horny. No doubt happy I was there and all the lovey dovey stuff, but he def wanted to fuck. One night we got drunk and he started to slip his hands In my pants and coming onto me sexually. I kept saying now moving away and hey persisted. It wasn’t until I pushed him off did hem get the message... That was a whole thing, I felt used and he felt shocked and guilty at my response questioning, “ Did I just sexually assault you?” Needless to say, this threw me on a long road of mania, as I am rape survivor. I was so confused. I mean he did stop, he didn’t penetrate me, the lines were fuzzy, but regardless we were both left in shambles after this. 

I was angry at times, I called him a predator once, although I don’t think he meant to hurt me. No matter how angry we got though we couldn’t let the other go. I’m beginning to think this is a shame bond... He swears he is in love with me and he does treat me well, but it’s been about nine months since and I’m having mania, rage and anxiety attacks weekly. This has worn him so thin to the point where he says he’s suffering and can’t accept that I just expect him to deal with it. I really just expect him to be supportive, but I understand he has boundaries and that he is emotionally triggered by my episodes.Sometimes I ask for help and I am met with anger and resentment for all the stress I put him through. He also deals with anxiety and depression and I support him mutually, but he says we aren’t the same because I’m bipolar and my mania can be extreme... I feel this is ableist?

I’m not sure what to do at this point... I love him, he’s supposed to come visit me for my birthday (the tickets are bought), but the dependency I have on him isn’t healthy and it’s killing this relationship. I’m used to calling him when I wake up since the time difference fits for him being off work then, but I know I spend way too much energy on him. It’s to the point where I’m on the phone with him most of the day and I feel like an alien when I’m alone. It’s very hard to focus on anything let alone myself. 

I can’t help but feel angry and blaming him for this stage of mania, as I was doing better before the incident between us. I don’t like the way he talks to me when he’s frustrated, and he has repeatedly told me how hard it is to love me. I cry every day and the suicidal thoughts come often and I feel so broken and alone when I can’t reach out to anybody. Right now we’re on this break, but what can I do to give my self and him emotional safety and healthy independence? Is it even worth it after all this pain? Not sure how to get to the root of this compulsive feeling that I need him to stay sane. I know it’s a lot to unpack, but what do you think?"
alevel takers?,2,mfprds,1,"i think this is general

hello im 19 and ive been writing here a lot lately because i feel like i dont have a lot of people that i can cannot w mentally yaknow cause we're different

um i used to be a really good student, i was best student for my entire school (the award accounts for academics + cocurriculars), am active in leadership roles like student representatives, i get pretty good grades like straight As were supposedly my standard, and i debate and do academic decathlons - you get the gist, people viewed as pretty much perfect albeit a little emotional to those im close to

i've always struggled w depression and took relatively high doses but yea kind of backfired as my episodes grew to be anger influenced and violent (before my episodes were just yaknow sob sob but i never got angry at people) and last month i got diagnosed as bipolar.

i have a-levels yo in may,, i really want to do it. ive been slowly studying again but i must admit its daunting. im on a scholarship btw, i dont actually live in the uk im asian. (also why mental health help isnt as advanced but its pretty alright but very much a big taboo)

im scared like my brain cant live up to it yaknow. ive gotten several uni offers and im waiting on one (London School of Economics) to either accept or reject me though ofc i hope it is the former. so like whats left is for me to push on my grades for my exams and ofc, get used to the transition of depression to bipolar. also might be midly adhd. fun times, fun times 🤡 

tldr: please give me reassurance that i can make it :')"

Does anyone else have a weird unhealthy attachment to someone?,12,mfgwbx,13,"There’s this girl that I met last summer who I have this strange attachment to. She’s a pretty shit friend in general and not someone I should keep inviting into my life. However, I’m just oddly fucking obsessive over the friendship. I post stuff on social media in hopes she sees it and responds. I go out of my way to message her over dumb stuff just to initiate a conversation. I’ve never acted this way before and if anyone else treated me the way she does, I’d end it real quick. It makes no sense to me because I have a hard time connecting with everybody else in my life. I just wondered if anyone else ever felt this way and how I can just get over it and stop hurting myself."
I'm a muslim and I'm doubting the existence of God since I got diagnosed with bipolar,7,mfirog,14,"I have been depressed since 2015. I always convinced myself to have faith. The better will come eventually. That was before. Now I have completely lost faith after I got diagnosed with bipolar type ll last year. It's getting harder to believe in anything. My parents keep asking me to worship everyday, to pray, to read Quran. But I feel so distant from it. Even if I did it I feel empty. This does not mean I'm an atheist. I am not sure if God even exists.

The reason why I post this here is because I'm confused if this is related to my illness or? I need guidance on this topic. I am scared to confront my therapist about this since he's also a Muslim. I only told this to my friend, who is also a Muslim and she said this is because of my illness. I hate to blame it on my illness. 

Please note that talking about this publicly is considered taboo here in my country. I don't know who to reach out for."
I need a good book about my condition(s),5,mfkw30,3,"First I want to say that everyone here is super awesome and incredibly resourceful! I honestly don't think I could work myself through some of the worst and difficult times without checking in here and sharing. So, to you all, thank you, you're so f'n wonderful!

Onward, I need a book, a good one. I've done some research and many books sound similar, perhaps I'm skeptical to pick one that reads like something stitched on a pillow in my therapist's office and/or pontificating like a set of rules.. I also am having anger issues. Even tho I'm a true believer in nonviolence to my core, I need to figure out a way to mitigate loved ones falling victim to my outbursts. What books tell it to you like it is, share empathic perspectives, and perhaps help you to relate with others who have the same disorder but don't see it the same as you do?

Thank you in advance!"
Manic warning sign? Also maybe trigger for delusions/food aversion,2,mfo67l,8,"So I have “Bipolar 1 disorder with psychotic features” 

For the past 3 weeks or so, I can’t remember, my sleep schedule has turned into staying up till 8 am and sleeping until 2pm or so and no matter what I do I cant fix it. Im still going to work and seeing friends/fam as normal And no reckless spending kinda.

But now recently im starting to stay awake past that and sleep after work 3-6 only then to stay up until 8 am again. 
I think i sleep 4-5 hours a night now so I’m usually up 20 or so hours every day. 

On top if that, now when I try to sleep now I feel weird? Like my body feels scared and sick and tingly and my heads fuzzy and I cant focus enough to sleep or relax and when I wake up my head feels heavy and not normal.  But I guess that could be because I’m so tired to begin with even if I don’t feel it

Ive had hypnagogic hallucinations before and have always had vivid not pleasant dreams but they’re a lot worse now. No hallucinations yet (I expect) but the head heaviness and confusion is what I used to get after a hypnagogic hallucination. 

I’ve also been struggling with the notion that someones following me and that all the food I prepare and eat is rotten or dangerous. Most times im able to rationalize it but sometimes it makes me feel physically sick and I have to spit out food or I can’t eat at all.

Im asking if it sounds like mania cuz I don’t feel emotionally manic. I don’t feel much of anything really to be honest and haven’t for a while but I don’t think I’m necessarily depressed? and I mean I’m not able to think correctly most days or its very fast but its like I’m having all the other physical/normal symptoms of mania or maybe psychosis? I just don’t feel good but Im not like feeling miserable if that makes sense? 

Could it be mixed? 
I just feel like I’m heading somewhere bad but I also don’t feel as nervous or worried as I think I should I’ve been very emotionally drained/turned off the past several months anyway. 

I just want to know if anyone else has felt this way before a manic episode or during cuz looking online always comes with outside looking in experiences and I’m feeling kinda alone in my bipolar at the moment."
Sometimes you need to be a mess to get through it,22,mfcd1h,3,"**Contains triggering material regarding trauma.**

The before day I had the abortion, my ex named “A” picked me up and we went to the grocery store. He had decided he’d like to make me a huge pot of cuban soup, so we went shopping. As I stood idly by he snapped that I go find something to do and not just stand there. With another stab in my heart, I dutifully went off to go act like I was busy. He didn’t like me just standing there next to him. Though I wasn’t just standing there of course. I was laden with sadness. Hyperaware of the present moment in time I believe I will always remember. The hours and days post-pregnancy realization- the two weeks it took to get to here. Now. At the grocery store shopping for food, I’d presumably eat following the procedure. The procedure which would remove the little life I had inside me. Which had made me eat nearly nothing for the last two months. I had been very sick and tired. The two weeks leading up to this point in my story had been the deepest cavern of grief I have ever entered in my life. And now as I am exhausted, nauseous, with a splitting headache, puffy eyes and a red face, I go off to busy myself over some carrots.

I had not expected the news I was pregnant which came two weeks after I had broken up with A. To compound the grief, I had simultaneously lost what I thought could be the love of my life. The perfect man seemed to slide through my fingers the same week I found out I was pregnant from my ex. Except that man had a girlfriend he forgot to mention during the days he swept me off my feet. I guess I turned out to not be good enough to leave her for. I was furious at him for leading me on and having me be the ‘other woman’. I felt terrible for her. And I hated him for it. For being that man.

I never wanted A to be there for the procedure. Not after how he received the news. He came over to my apartment screaming at me demanding I go get the procedure then and there. There was nothing to discuss, he’d yell. What was I thinking? What a foolish woman. I just got a new bike- don’t I want to ride it? I don’t really want a baby, he said. What, something that will cry and demand all my attention? Didn’t I want to keep drinking and having fun with him? No? He left crying he’d never speak to me again, I’d be alone, I have no friends and no family who cares. I’d be alone and wouldn’t see a penny from him. Maybe he’d talk to me after I gave birth but don’t count on it. He slammed the door.

A few days later he came back. I had hoped he wanted to talk. I had found many resources to help and it didn’t really seem impossible. We didn’t have to have everything figured out just yet. We had, after all, discussed having a baby together a few times before. Maybe he needed a few days to cool off. I think he had thought of every horrible thing he could say to me on his way to my apartment that day. The gut-wrenching tears I cried and continue to cry are less for me than the baby. The baby I still had inside me I felt I had to protect from him. At that moment it felt like ‘us’ against ‘him’. And then I cried for the death of the family that could have been.

Rather than come to discuss the present civilly, every very word he said was like a knife in my heart. Every justification, rationalization, projection, unconscious fear, rejection, everything, felt like a dagger. And I had the man of beauty in my memory to compare him to. The two couldn’t have been more diametrically opposed. A was a wild lion; loud, callous, parasitic, rambunctious, charismatic, rude, artistic and unpredictable. M was a man of class. Balanced, logical, successful, spiritual, educated, empathic. But they had one thing in common; they were liars.

After the procedure, I spiraled down into two of the worst months I have had in my life. In one week I lost three things that in and of themselves would have been devastating. The baby, the man of my dreams, and the abusive fallout with A- which compounded the rejection from M. Everything A said to me about being worthless, crazy, foolish, naive, sick, friendless, family-less echoed in my ears. A couple of times I considered checking myself into a hospital for suicidal thoughts which began to resemble a concrete plan. It’d be easy. I’d sell everything I owned, buy a gun, travel in South America, and when the money was gone just end it. End my pathetic, useless, mess of a life. With a bang. I was in a critical state. I boarded myself up in the house, only cooking and eating the soup A made me, talking to myself in full conversations, sobbing, then feeling full of energy and ready to tackle a painting, drinking and smoking heavily. I’d take modafinil to have a ‘productive’ day, then would drink and smoke my vape pen until I was barely able to walk to bed. I woke up each morning thinking ‘ugh another day’. And the memories would come. And I would curl up in a ball and sob. I couldn’t, and still can’t, listen to music with lyrics. I want it all to get out of my head. Anywhere I am I get furious at what's playing. One major delusion of mine is 'messages in the music'. I take these things as signs. Given my mental state I can't stand any happy music of love and life, nor do I want someone else's sorrows and bullshit on my mind. Music is a great passion of mine and it has been, for the first time, banished. All I can swallow is classical and ambient. Dancing and singing and vibrancy is dead to me. Where it was once what healed me through all these years.

Every time I see a beautiful woman or hear beautiful music I think of M’s girlfriend. She must be amazing; beautiful, successful, independently wealthy, a great dancer and spiritual to have him. Maybe that woman looks like her. And I stand there and cry.

Ten years ago I was diagnosed with depression with psychotic features. But when given an SSRI, a full-blown manic episode was triggered. It was great for my painting but left my life in shambles. I was re-diagnosed as having Bipolar I. I resisted treatment and medication for eight years therafter, so from what I understand I am much worse off for it. Much of the delusions I struggle with are paranoia-based. This has been the worst episode I have had except for the time I was hospitalized. The last time I was hospitalized back in 2010, I totally lost my shit after having had a devastating experience with the first of three great loves in my life.

I think the most frightening thing is not being able to distinguish reality from what is. In the moment I am so perfectly, seamlessly, naturally sure of what is happening. Only in retrospect do I see how inappropriate, deluded, misguided and plain wrong I was. Which circles us back to the futility of life those with Bipolar feel. When only in retrospect we see the truth. The realization and acceptance of this raw honesty is understanding the persistence of this curse. That it is my fate to never get it right.  I can never trust what I am thinking. Because at any moment I may be completely mad.

Through all of this M has shown up as an angel. Encouraging me, gently gently gently to stop drinking. Encouraging the painting. Encouraging meditation. And I have felt nothing short of fury at him. It comes in waves. Day after day I am pounded. The grief and anger. Forgiveness and love come, for a time. Then I am furious again. I try and try to forgive and put the past behind, and be a friend. Recognize what kind of person he is deciding to show up as- now. To forgive what happened and start anew with the kind of friend he is trying to be in my life. And I can't do it. I have not been this furious at someone for such a prolonged time in my life. Usually, sadness always wins out. In this case, the anger has. And it turns me so sad to see myself self-destruct and continue to be angry and push someone out who is wholly trying to be present in the most neutral and supportive way. I see what I am doing. And I am grieved that I can't forgive him. I don't know how much of this has to do with my illness, or how much is simply justified on a human scale. My friends and family (yes I have them) would say I stand supported in feeling how I do. But to me there is always something wrong if anger and grief are held so strongly. I think we always need to find what needs to be healed, and do what we can do for each other to heal it. That's what love is. We all fuck up. But love is committing to healing and moving forward.

Anyways the whole point of this long rant is my realization today that sometimes you just need to be a fucking mess to get through it. M encouraged me to stop drinking and meditate and be all-around more healthy, which I am no doubt sure would be great for my overall well-being- but even the suggestion of that made me angry. Why? Because I hadn't gotten the mess out. Two months ago I was at the bottom of the ladder. No one could pull me up. Not even my own stubborn self looking at the light. No, I needed to be here as long as I needed before I decided it was going to change. It's so easy to want big things overnight. I felt that way this whole time- I needed to make big changes and then xyz will happen. I realized today that there's not a damn thing wrong with my needing to have a few beers and write and paint and think myself into and through where I am now. Tomorrow will be different. A week will- a month even more yet. But right now, I am here. And that is fucking ok.

Bipolar disorder caused my girlfriend to ghost me. Can anyone help or give me advice?,2,mfo2cq,5,"This girl I've been seeing and I really liked is bipolar, and recently she's been having an episode where she was being extremely insecure and she insisted that I didn't actually like her or want to see her because we hadn't hung out in a while. I started working overtime at my job because I had to, but I tried to keep in touch with her as much as I could. Out of nowhere one day she just blocked me on everything, presumably because she thought I wasn't actually interested in her, even though I've understood and tried so hard, and I even texted her friends and family and I've got nothing. I know she is at least physically safe. Is there any way I could go about reaching her again?"
Home ownership with my bipolar partner?,1,mfse8h,12,"Just looking for some advice. I am with my partner who is bipolar and gets manic pretty often. Recently we moved in together (losing our seperate and very cheap rent controlled places) and now we’re thinking  of buying a place. 

I would love to get a home and be a part of the haves, instead of the have nots, but then would be tied to this person. On the other hand if I don’t buy a place and leave them, neither of us will probably ever have a chance to own property ever in BC Canada. And they will be left to find a very expensive rental themselves since they don’t do well with room mate situations (keeps thinking they are spies)

Neither one of us can stand our current place since it’s super loud so we are moving either way."
Atypical manic episodes - who else’s manic behaviour doesn’t really fit the stereotypical picture?,4,mfko9c,8,"My first “manic” episode was 2018. He’s some ways mine don’t fit the stereotype, despite be needing hospitalisation for it: 

1. I saved money before during and after.
2. I had no inappropriate sex (to be fair this might have happened while psychotic if I’d been living with people who’d take advantage) 
3. I remember feeling way more anxious scared an paranoid that I’d done something wrong or people were out to get me than I did euphoric 
4. I find mania physically painful and desperately want it to stop when I fell it coming on and during 
5. I recognise something is wrong long before family friends and mental health professionals 

Things that are atypical My depression episodes:

1. So far have been worse on medications
2. I sleep more not less (could be medication related) 
3. Unless I’m on antipsychotics i can usually get up and go to work un medicated an function more than people expect 
4. I eat more and gain weight (might be medication related)


Obviously there are other ways I do fit what is more typically considered to be bipolar behaviours and experiences just thought it would be interesting to see the ways we don’t fit what even mental health professionals expect of the bipolar mind."
I don’t hate being bipolar,6,mfjgnx,9,"Hey all, I wrote something about my feelings on being bipolar and I just really wanted to share it.


I don’t hate being bipolar. It’s part of who I am. I hate that people can tell my mood states when they know me well enough, they know when I’m not ‘normal’; I hate that people can view me as fragile or take pity in me as a result of my mood disorder. I hate how careful I have to be sometimes. I hate that my peers can pull an all nighter and be okay, when that can send me into a full blown episode. I hate how closely I have to monitor myself.

But I don’t hate being bipolar.

I have mood episodes. And that’s okay, it’s normal, for me, and needs to be normalized. I experience emotions and ups and downs, just like everyone else. I may be more sensitive to mood changes, and mine may be different, more severe, actual episodes rather than just moods, but that’s okay. I don’t need anyone to look at me differently, or feel obligated to advise me. I know what I need. I take my medications, I do my work early so I can avoid all nighters as much as possible, I monitor myself.

I don’t hate being bipolar. I sometimes wish I didn’t have to monitor myself so closely. I envy my peers who can do more than I without worrying about the long-term mental health repercussions. But being bipolar has shaped so much of my being. The many hypomanic hobbies I’ve picked up over the years, most of which I dropped, have led me to find where I thrive. My hypomanic decision to go to RISDs program is how I heard about Industrial Design. My deep depressive episodes that I wouldn’t wish on anyone have bestowed me with a deep sense of empathy. Being bipolar has been an integral part of my life and has shaped who I am.

I’m bipolar. And I’m okay with that."
Weird mania recognition moment.,22,mfc9rf,8,"Have you ever had the exciting feeling of unrecognized mania ripped away by recognizing your mania in the strangest thing. Drinking, hyper sexuality, grandiose nonsense, new guitar... they all got passed by my mania radar. But I just listened to Candy by Mandy Moore on repeat for an hour and I had a *fucking* blast. It came on my running playlist (after Opeth and *insert cool band*...) and I continued to listen when I got home. Then I realized, “oh this is definitely mania and it has been here for a minute.”

Now I wish I recognized earlier. It is absolute horse shit that Mandy Moore’s “Candy” was the thing that pulled me out of a manic stupor and not the shameful shit. What the hell are the meds and therapy for? I feel like such a failure. I had so many chances to just stop and think about if my behavior was okay, but it took getting weirdly into a song to finally get me to reflect. I don’t like what that says about my values. I also feel kinda confused which is unpleasant. This shit sucks, y’all. Writing this helped though."

Asked my doctor to be put on antidepressants he said no way because it could cause a manic episode. I don't know how much longer I can deal with this deep dark depression. Any of you deal with this?

Are breakdowns common while manic?,9,mffe3y,5,"I think I’m hypomanic at the least right now like I’ve completely flipped my room the past few days (by myself). My thoughts are racing. blah blah I’m trying to justify the mania but I def think I’m manic right now.

Okay so I had a breakdown after a full day of double texting and trying to plan like 4 vacations (I didn’t buy anything so dont worry and it looks like only one few day trip to see my friends is viable and thats like $100 roundtrip so its alright). Anyway so I had a breakdown and I feel terrible I feel like crap. I don’t wanna die but I certainly hate my life and wish everything was different. Maybe I’ve just overextended myself this week. But is that common? By breakdown I just mean like an anxiety attack just crying a lot, shaking, couldn’t look at my phone and my vision was blurry I just had to put my head in my pillows for like an hour and a half to calm down."
Didn't sleep for two weeks. Is it bipolar or can it be anxiety?,6,mfgdfp,10,"I've been diagnosed for a year. 

I went to the emergency in the psych aisle due to being absolutely unable to sleep for two entire weeks. I was terrified and convinced I was dying and had to prevent my death. I found old prescriptions to get blood drawn in order to justify going to the hospital, very early, twice during the two weeks. The nurses kept asking me if I was ok, if I had eaten - I also didn't eat for the duration of the two weeks, I was unable to eat. At the hospital while getting my blood drawn, my bf was with me and I was hiding in the bathrooms not to leave, I felt I was safe in the hospital if anything was to happen to me. It was hell. Absolute hell. 

I decided to work out a lot to exhaust myself and make sure I'd sleep, but it didn't make me sleep at all. I came in to see a therapist urgently (I was not diagnosed back then) and I have no idea why he didn't click I'm bipolar. I was diagnosed years later. Eventually, life went back to normal gradually and I just started to sleep again like nothing happened. I cannot remember if this was followed by depression or not. 

Anyways, when I bring up this event to my psychiatrist, she says it can be anxiety? Not an actual episode of mania or hypomania. Since I didn't sleep AT ALL for two weeks, I have a hard time believing that was anxiety. I just want to know cause I often doubt my diagnosis, although I definitely am bipolar, I'm bothered this thing in my life is still blurred in a way. 

Can anxiety be the cause of this? Thank you!"
Could one have a mild case of bipolar?,1,mfpegb,7,I see all these stories of how crazy it feels to have the disorder but are there any mild cases? Could one have a mild case of bipolar where the depressive episode are only mildly depressing and where the mania episodes are also just mildly intensive?
I finally found a good way to manage my manic spending,10,mfeoh2,5,"Recently, I’ve come to a realization that there’s a (relatively easy) way I can manage my manic spending. Whenever I decide on some crazy new hobby/thing I *have* to have when I’m manic, I try to always order from amazon.
Their return policy is amazing and free, and you can return anything (opened/used/without packaging/etc) within like 60 days. Realizing this has saved me so much money when I realize I’m never actually going to get into embroidery but I somehow bought all of the supplies because I can just return everything in one trip to a UPS store with free return shipping and see a refund usually that day. When that doesn’t scratch the itch and I can’t wait for prime shipping, I started going to the dollar tree. They have little jars/yarn/soaps and things that fill the void in the meantime.

TLDR: try manic shopping on Amazon, you can return anything (even if it’s used) for up to 60ish days even if it’s not in good condition. If you can’t wait for prime shopping, go to the dollar tree while you wait."
Medication issues,2,mflmfy,3,"Hi y’all. I’ve got a few questions regarding my med combo. I’m taking 125 mg lamictal and 50 mg seroquel. I only take the seroquel at night before bed. I’ve been on the meds for about two months and I noticed some skin issues. Firstly, I’m breaking out in cystic acne under my chin; it’s start to spread down my neck. I’ve noticed more eczema breakouts than usual as well. Neither of these medications are working for me anymore. The higher the dosage, the more it starts to affect me negatively, so I’m going to discuss with my doc about the possibility of weaning off of both. Just wondering if anyone’s experienced the same skin issues. Definitely isn’t helping the self esteem issues. TIA"
Lamictal questions,7,mfgn6b,8,"Basically, I have been on 50mg of Lamictal since September of 2020. I know, very low dosage. I think it has worked wonders for me and have been religious about taking it on schedule. However, I was out of town for 3 nights last weekend and got a little off schedule. I typically take my meds before bed but ended up taking them in the morning when I was out of town. I did not feel particularly out of whack at first, but after a week of taking my meds at a different time, I am starting to fear that I am trending towards mania (nothing severe but enough to be slightly concerned). I think it would be in my best interest to get back on my regular schedule, so my question is, how should I go about doing so? I know I have already disrupted my med schedule enough and would rather not fuck it up any more if possible."
Do you have moments you consider cringy but other people dont?,5,mfhg1r,3,"I had a manic episode seven years ago. When i have these episodes im more attracted to women. I consider every women a goddess.  I dont have issues talking to women.

I was at my friends wedding.  Her friend went to the bridal suite, i just had to talk to her. But at this this time i didnt know she just came out of a bad relationship.  So she wasnt emotionally ready.

 I go in the bridal suite and i start talking, i start saying things to her that should be written in some romance novel, a few minutes later, i start holding her hands talking to her in the eyes, something was about to happen, but then the door knocked, i got blocked you can say. It was something out of a movie moment.

In a normal situation this would be something people would be proud of doing. But honestly,i find this cringy because i wasnt in ""full"" control because of mania.

My friends brings up this moment once in awhile.  If someone mentions her wedding party, she brings up my moment also.

Do you have moments cringy that others dont mind?"

Sometimes the manic and psychosis is so bad that I imagine God is sending me messages in YouTube videos telling me to punish myself. I get false memories and have delusions that people are following me, I imagine that old friends and my family are plotting against me. How am I supposed to tell the difference anymore? Half of what I think isn't real. I just wish I could meet myself as I am without the bipolar. Maybe that way I wouldn't feel like such a lost cause."

My husband (very kindly and lovingly) told me that he thinks I need to talk to my doctor about my insane mood swings. He thinks I’m bipolar. He’s bipolar as well, so I trust his judgement and I know he put a lot of thought into telling me this. When I asked him how long I’ve been having these episodes, he said since we met. That was 5 years ago. HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN LIKE THIS?! 😭 I don’t have anyone I could ask and actually receive a thoughtful answer from. 


And now I’m digging deep into my soul and tying to recall my earliest memories of mania or depression and it’s painful af. My anxiety has masked so many red flags. I’m pretty sure I’m going into a manic episode because of how much this is bothering me. I’ve never had a reason for my shitty brain until now, and now I feel like I don’t even know who I am or what im really like. I sincerely hate this. 


Was learning about your bipolar disorder also incredibly painful? Or is this a “just me” issue? I emailed my psychiatrist but haven’t heard back yet because of the weekend. I assume he’ll tell me it’s just my anxiety because everything is always “just my anxiety”"
The death,6,mfbr27,7,"What happens after we die? This is the great question that kills me from inside. I'm alive physically but I'm dead mentally trying to make sense of it. We're alive on this so called earth, that is a spinney planet. Its messed up, how do we know that big bang made the universe? Like the whole reality (simulation) our perception aka a dream came out of nothingness. I don't even know and we don't know what's real, is me typing just a simulation a dream? It's all so messed up. I don't even care much about things now, I take precautions sure. But I just feel like I can float through life, its so hard to explain. We're all here for a reason, at least I think so. I believe that there must be a higher goal than just reproduction. Like what's having 8 children going to help you with regarding the existence. Maybe you were meant to fulfil this since you were made out of cells in the mothers womb. The great things we see or at least look for in ""rich people"" Are fame and money, but why. Do we need that to have nicer things than others? Just to show off, there must be a purpose and it all messes with my head"

- Gardening. Vegetables and the like. 

- Miniature model painting. Kinda still in it. 

- Warhammer 40k. This was my second manic go around with it. Spent too much money. Wife was pissed about this one. 

- Playing the violin. I was convinced I could learn and master it in a few months. 

- Joining the military. I practiced for the ASVAB (sp) and told my boss I was going to join and they would need to find a replacement soon. I never joined. 

- Masters Degree. I enrolled without a lot of thought on this. I made it through one class before the depression hit and the mania ended. 

- Writing a book. Started an outline. Bought a chrome book just for this purpose. I knew it was going to be a best seller. I understood sci-fi like no one else. Never got past 2 pages. 

- Frisbee golf. Bought the discs, read up, played once. Was ready to buy everything because I would be the best. Wife stopped me. 

- Drawing with colored pencils. I am now working on this. Spent money on everything I can. I swear, this one will work and I'll be great. So far, I've drawn ONE pictures. It literally, and figuratively, doesn't look good.

Are these racing thoughts?,2,mfabl0,7,"I'm starting to wonder if I have bipolar and racing thoughts and this isnt just a strong inner critic cause everything I do or dont do I have this constant internal voice telling me I suck, I'm no good, it's like a loop on repeat that never ends. It is constantly beating me down and makes me feel worthless. As a result I live a solitary life because it gets out of control around people?

It never ends and I'm wondering if it is racing thoughts and part of bipolar, so I'll be eating something 'you look crazy when your eating, you look like a wild animal, oh look your hands are shaking you freak, no wonder you cant stand to eat infront of people, you have no friends to eat with anyway, better keep eating to stay alive you pathetic joke' this is what running through my head when I'm eating. 

I'll play some guitar 'you really think you can be any good at this, you are deluding yourself, your whole life a delusional, your no good at anything, you cant cope with life, you are pathetic, no wonder nobody wants to be friends with you, look at you, look how sad you are, look how sad your life is, your a nobody, your nothing '

I'll read spiritual things to try and get out of this ' nothing can save you from the disaster you are and always will be, try your best to get out of it, but it will never work, your never going to escape the fact your less than everyone and the most humiliating person  everytime you open your mouth you humiliate yourself '

My therapist said that I've an extremely loud inner critic, but I'm wondering is this racing thoughts and part of bipolar? Cause I know people have bad thoughts about themselves but this is a barrage of hatred and venom that takes me over ?"
my bpso keeps changing his mind?,1,mfeafx,3,"my boyfriend \[23\] keeps changing his mind about really big things in our relationship. after dating for 8 months, we broke up because he said he was overwhelmed and needed to sit down and find himself and figure out what was going on with his mental health. This was pre-diagnosis. we were broken up for a little over a month where we had 0 contact. he found out in that time that he has bipolar 1 and was medicated for it. We reconnected soon after his diagnosis and have been inseparable since. It's been almost a year now and we decided that moving in together was our best course of action. We took a few road trips to decide where we would like to move and finally decided on a city right outside of dallas, tx. We started looking at apartments and found a place to tour. we found a date to make the drive and things seemed to be moving forward.

a few days after making those plans, i noticed that he started to get incredibly distant. he wasn't as affectionate and wasn't talking much. after a week of this, i finally asked what was wrong and he told me, once again, that he wasn't sure about the relationship (even though he's been reassuring me that he IS sure for months) and that he was thinking of ending things. we decided not to make any impulsive decisions, and the next day we talked more. i brought up tabling the conversation about moving in together if it overwhelmed him and he said if we did that, it felt better than breaking up. 

i'm incredibly confused because for the past few months that we've been together again, he has reassured me, even when i don't ask for it, that he wants to be with me and that because he has been diagnosed and medicated that these things won't happen again. but yet... here i am. i'm now sitting here wondering if the love of my life is going to break up with me in a few months if we decide not to live together after our current leases are up.

i suppose i'm wondering if it's harder for people with bipolar disorder to stick to decisions that they seem so sure about. he was the one to even bring up moving in together. i'm just so hurt and confused because i don't want to lose him again, but i also feel like i can't handle the constant wishy-washyness of it all.

Can you have SJS without a rash? (lamotrigine)?,2,mfa1pj,3,"I know we're not doctors and I'm pretty sure the answer is no but wanted to ask other people who have taken lamotrigine if this is possible.

My dose was upped a month ago and I felt like I had a horrible flu for three days but then that went away and I never developed a rash or anything. It seems like the rash always develops from what I've read and that that's the main symptom but I'm paranoid and want to make sure before I hop off of a drug that's helped me immensely."
"Mild psychotic symptoms, does it get worse?",4,mf3ja8,7,"During mania and mixed episodes I have experienced a whole range of mild psychotic symptoms.

-everyone around me has the same face
-I thought my friends were controlling me through a playlist
-I convinced myself my room was infected with rats and I couldn't touch the floor.

These are just a few examples. 

All of these have lasted hours, or max 2 days.
Some have happened while medicated, but most have happened before.

I can live with symptoms like these, but I am really scared that one day it will take over.

Those of you that experience full psychosis, did it start like this?

Or are there others that experience mild psychotic symptoms like these and live relatively well with them?"
My mom talking is one of my biggest triggers,1,mfdtfj,14,"I can't stand to hear her voice. She annoys me so much. I feel like one day I'm gonna snap and beat the shit out of her. I've already done it twice for different reasons, and if I do it one more time I'm gonna go to jail. I keep warning her subtly by saying, ""I can't be the one to start the fight,"" or ""It'll be self defense if I throw the second punch."" She annoys me so much. I can't stand her. 

What do I do? How do I handle this trigger? She doesn't have to be talking about something specific. It's just her talking, just her speaking is what pisses me off. I hate people who never shut up."

I Am Sick And Tired . . .,3,mf214z,11,"Of people pretending to be the brave ones publicly flaunting their mental illnesses when it’s just a ploy to get attention and special treatment. 

The other day a lady at work ignored safety and production protocols resulting in an entire shifts work being scrapped. This cost the company a minimum of $150,000. After being “reprimanded” she laughed telling me that she just had to play the bipolar card and they let her off with a written warning!

She’s done this in the past to get away with excessively calling in. Not using fmla days or hr approved medical leave. Just calling in. She’s used it on the production floor to get out of doing jobs she doesn’t want to do, she uses it to have long breaks, and she uses it to get other employees to do her work. 

And I’ve seen others do this too!

I understand using fmla or hr approved leave. Those are ok. I understand that you may not always be at your peak, but you can’t just use mental health to excuse being a crappy employee. 

I’ve had other employees whisper to me about her special treatment. It’s not helping anyone by playing into the mental health stigmas. 

I don’t share my being bipolar unless I have to. I know that that’s my choice. I keep my stuff together for 8 hrs a day. Others should too. I don’t think that’s too much to ask. 

Thanx for letting me get that off my chest. 

Smash that dislike button.

TL;DR - A lady at work intentionally uses her mental illness to get away with being a crappy employee. I’m not happy with her."
feeling like you constantly need to be doing something or need constant stimulation causing severe inner tension but depressed and unmotivated..can this be hypomania/mania?,2,mf7wp9,9,"Right now, I’m medicated (depakote, seroquel, multivitamin, IV ketamine treatments as needed) so I actually don’t feel like I have the energy to start doing things but it’s like on the inside I feel this constant need that I need to be doing something or need some form of stimulation because I’m so uncomfortable and have so much inner tension. I’m constantly tapping my feet, wringing my hands, biting my nails and skin around them, etc but it’s not like I’m doing any sort of obnoxious behavior.  I’m severely depressed and don’t really have to motivation to act on my feelings of needing to do things. It’s just so uncomfortable, but I have this idea of if a person is manic they must look or be acting really energetic so I don’t think I am. Of my documented mood episodes I’ve only really had mixed episodes I guess. Never really knew the concept of mixed episodes though until recently so still trying to figure out if this is a mood episode people or just how a person feels having bipolar disorder.

Nausea and anxiety in the workplace,3,mf440u,2,"I feel suicidal because I cannot perform most tasks that most people can do at a job that pays minimum wage at a coffee place. When I cant put food in a bag, make drinks, or other things because of my anxiety I feel stupid. Im still trying to get comfortable taking orders and I was told yesterday that its time that I learn how to make drinks and that stressed me out. I dont know how to reply to others questions knowing that I feel like garbage, I havent ate and I'm nauseous. I dont move as fast as the others.

Ive been here for one month. Im always asking for help for lots of things. It just feels like Im going nowhere just because of how uncomfortable and insecure I am in my own skin. The job makes me suicidal. The people there are fine, its just the job. Ive been very nauseous everyday here because of how much the job stresses me out. Medds and therapy have been ineffective or harmful. I work four hour shifts and those shifts take about everything in me to finish. and I havent ate much since working but I like the idea of financial security, being payed at a higher hourly rate than everyone else, free food and drinks everyday, and a sense of belonging. I felt like such a loser playing video-games everyday while everyone else worked while I was unemployed for 8 months after being laid off due to covid. I dont feel connected to my body."
DAE...Social media shame?,3,mf3xh0,3,"So COVID/Quarantine really knocked me right on my ass. For a few different reasons (insurance, job loss, not being able to see a doc, then just laziness and mental illness) I stopped taking all my medication last July. I was like taking it every other day or every two days starting in June to stretch out my dose (lol, who can relate!!) 

I had convinced myself I had PTSD, or nothing at all, that I wasn’t bipolar. I was wrong!!! The one positive is that...once again, now I really know lol.

I ended up immediately spiraling. Oh my god—I behaved so poorly online. I was in a mixed state for months, heavy on the depression. I didn’t post cringe content EVERY day but when I did post things it was like diary style, “Here’s a look at my life,” YIKES. One time I aired a grievance with someone publicly. Posted ridiculous, unhinged tweets. I wake up a night and shame spiral. It haunts me. I worry so much about how other must perceive me now. 

I had to delete everything. I have never done that before—normally I enjoy social media, now it makes me paranoid. I just started medication again. I feel like I made such an ass of myself. My friends who know I am bipolar would never think I’d make a judgment call like that, going off my medication. 

Anyway, anyone else? How have you moved on?"
Impossible to rely on others,2,mf66ns,3,"I have like zero capacity for relying on other people to do what I need them to do.

Mood tracking inspiration please!,1,mf87pv,4,"Hi my dear humans with similar diagnoses. Currently working with a lovely  dual trained MH nurse ana psychotherapist.

Basically so we can better analyse  my symptom patterns and response to medication over time so I can make more informed decisions about behaviour modifications and see how different therapies are actually affecting my well being. 

I don’t have overly typical presentations of mania or depression either so most mood trackers aren’t really geared up for me. 

I was wondering if anyone had symptoms trackers they’ve designed of their own? Ana if you’re willing to share bits to help me work out what’s worth putting in my first draft thanks. I’ll try and attach a photo of what I have so far to jel give you an idea of what I’m doing"

St. John’s wort as an alternative to ssris,1,mf7rhy,4,"I hate SSRIs. I really despise them. I hate the agitation, the pacing, how dumb they make me feel. I know this stuff is often used for social anxiety, but it makes me socially disabled. I switch between freezing up around people and rambling complete nonsense .

But, I’ve been on a down swing for the past 4 or so months and that’s dysfunctional in itself. 

I’ve been on taking at John’s wort for the past two days and although it’s not great. I don’t feel as “possessed” as I do on SSRIs.

Considering I’m on mood stabilizers, does St. John’s wort have any more risk than regular ssris? Or would it be about the same? Is there anything else I should know?

Edit: idk if you’d call this mixed episodes. But a big part of my bipolar is feeling slow, drowsy and dumb, but also agitated and up at the same time? Like I’ll be laying in bed at innapropriate times but then I’ll feel an uncomfortable urge, almost like a shock, to get up and moving and I’ll have to get on my bike or get outside"
My relationship with God,1,mf7ncg,6,"I had my religious awakening during the summer. In the church I sat in the back, the priest spoke to me. I was shown a number and when that number appeared something was supposed to happen. Ended with my friend crying and a stranger paying a taxi for us home.

//

In the city in the church in the room to the right there is a book you can write in. Write something to god or to the church. If you go back to fall it says “Don’t tell me to punch people”. I went back to see if I had actually written in it when I was there with a friend and he didn’t believe I wrote it.

//

I had broken up with god. I was invested in other things. The clock had stopped at 18:52 and I wanted to know why. I ended up in the city I grew up in. Even went to church to mock him and tell him there was nothing there that scared me anymore and in return he mocked me. The time was 18:52. When the church bells started ringing all I hear was laughing and I was so angry he was telling the entire city he had tricked me again. Everyone was looking at me, as if I was causing a scene.

//

In the schoolyard we were looking for someone. He kept shouting “stop” and no matter where we went he kept teleporting. I first heard him when I saw the hare and I always see them it should be a red flag by now. Me and my friend gave up. He turned off the flashlight and we continued our walk. We passed a small church and I heard something in the graveyard. My friend said “I’m not going in there”. I told him to just listen. “Do you hear the church bells?” I asked and he said “I don’t want to be here”.

//

I’m waiting for someone by the statue every day after work. He will show up eventually and he will show me what to do. He treats his bipolar disorder using religion. He never showed up.

//

I’m in his living room and he turns on a movie about vampires. It’s disgusting. We are drinking red wine but I have barely touched mine and he keeps doing shots. He asks me if I’m cold and wants him to close the window but he doesn’t know I’m listening to the man outside repeating “The blood. In the glass.”. He closes the window and it gets very quiet. I ask him if he’s religious and I feel like I’m looking right through him. He says yes but he wants to know why I ask.

I’m in the kitchen and I’m looking for a knife. He’s freaking out calling my friend. I do not want to do this but I want to know what would happen if I did. I’m getting irritated because I’m trying to explain to him the reason and he doesn’t understand.

I’m in the bathroom and the door is locked. He opens it with a pocket knife. I say your scissor is no good it barely penetrates the skin. He’s showing me his self harm scars. I say nonono you don’t get it I just need the blood and there’s no blood.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It keeps coming back, I keep going back to religion. It terrifies me afterwards and I scare people away. This people can't relate to so they don't understand and I can't explain because I don't understand either."

Craving madness / intrusive thoughts,4,meyfd8,4,"Hey,

Sorry if this isn’t allowed or if it’s triggering. I’m in a bit of a strange place at the moment & this is the safest space I know to be open.

I’m diagnosed Bipolar and on 100mg Quetiapine soon to be increased tomorrow to 125.

For the last 4 days My mood on Daylio had been tracked as “Up” - my one step before hypomania so I’m trying to keep tabs on myself. I’m still new to this whole disorder and I’m still learning about where bipolar ends and I begin.

Basically, I’ve been having incredibly intrusive thoughts about wanting to get high. Weed, cocaine, alcohol and even crack.

I’ve never had any issues with alcohol or substance misuse per say. I used to smoke weed 4/7 days a week up until 6 years ago when I turned my life around. I used to use cocaine recreationally (couple times a year) sometimes lacing a spliff with it. Last used this substance in 2017 when having an episode.

I’ve never been a massive drinker. I drink on occasions (birthdays / Xmas) etc and maybe once or twice a year. This is through my own choice and not based on dependency etc.

For the last 2 days or so I’ve been craving getting high. Wanting to feel stoned, or elated through coke. I’ve even fantasied about crack! I know! It’s absurd! 

Is this a sign my mood is going to spurt into hypo or am just a fuck up? Is this a symptom of my disorder do you think or am I just sabotaging myself.

I’ve got an appointment with my doc tomorrow to discuss the increase of my meds to 125 and I’m scared to bring this up for fear of, well I don’t know what. 

Sorry for the massive essay!"

I need advice,2,mew8ym,2,I have bipolar disorder. It has been pretty consistent where Ill have longer manic episodes and shorter periods of depression. But recently in the last year it seems like it's doing the opposite. I feel so drained and overwhelmed especially this past week and it's getting harder to be content and not get super angry or start crying when ever I get frustrated. I do not want to talk to my parents about anything that's going on or about going to therapy because they always minimize and invalidate my emotions especially when I bring up the fact that I was supposed to get officially diagnosed by a specialist almost two years ago because my therapist I had seen for a few years at that point said he thinks I definitely have bipolar disorder but he can't diagnose me. Its frustrating because I'll have time periods where I'm completely fine and then every few months something will trigger it and I'll start going into a manic or depressive state. I know I am entering a depressive state and I would really appreciate any advice in how to slow it or make it not as bad.

The Community mental health team came out to see me on Thursday to check on me, it's normally one lovely person but their manager ""randomly"" came with them this time, turns out the psych team contacted them to say I was violent in A&E which is a complete lie and I'm struggling to get my head around it. 


BUT, on Friday I started to just feel average, steady, normal if that's a word we can use! I've felt mania bubbling away under the surface but I think (I don't know about you but it's hard to fucking judge) that I've just had a really nice two days without being manic. I've slept 4 hours since Monday and don't feel tired so I'm obviously not 100% but I've not done anything destructive or out of control. And I've just had 2 days where I think I've felt how people that aren't mentally ill feel every day. 

I've enjoyed my own company, got some cleaning and washing done, but not at 10million miles an hour and on repeat, I've been for a blood test which made me leave the house alone! Score! And I had an electrician here for a few hours, I hid upstairs but I don't think he noticed how uneasy I was. 

I've had a productive couple of days whilst desperately trying not to push myself to hard because I know ill have to pay for it later. It's just been nice. That really boring and mundane kind of nice."

I got my covid vaccine and my anxiety didn’t make me pass out!!,10,meme0c,4,"I have SUCH bad anxiety and sometimes I worry myself so much that I turn physically sick. I also get sick sometimes because I have an ED, so they two together make needles a little scary. I took some ativan, ate some food, and tried to remind myself that I was feeling fine. I did it! I’m also just excited to have it, it feels very monumental lol. Let’s just hope round two goes well, I heard the second shot of moderna is a bitch, but I will try to to ✨worry ✨"
Late onset,20,mehrka,7,"I was diagnosed at 45 after a (to me) horrific episode of mania, including delusions and I think audio hallucinations. I was earning six figures at the time, but I didn’t like my job, and my marriage was falling apart. I went to the ER one night and had an overnight in the ER two nights later. I knew I needed to check in three days later when I couldn’t bring myself to ask my brother (who was visiting from out of town because he knew something was up) to protect me from the assassins who I was convinced were after me. I think I made up gunshots. I was convinced the only way I could safely get to the hospital was via ambulance, thinking the metal sides would protect me from gunshots. 

I’ve gotten back to work, but it took a couple of years to build up the confidence. The biggest difficulty has been losing friendships. I think I pushed some people away, but I did some embarrassing things during my mania, and I’m sure some of them just turned away, not knowing what to do.

In the end, I’m convinced my case is “mild.” I can work at a pretty high level. I have ups and downs, periods of “would be” hypomania and the lowlight film of things I’m ashamed of from childhood in. But it’s the loss of friendships that is so difficult. Not easy to make friends at 50.

Any experience with Ketamine treatments?,3,meqw7v,16,"After battling mental illness for most of my life and going through a slew of medications that don't seem very beneficial anymore, I'm about to pursue a more aggressive treatment - intravenous Ketamine.

If your in a rough spot now, I’d like you to know it gets better.  Just keep going.  Even if all you can do today is taking a shower and listening to calming music, if that’s how you manage and take care of yourself then that’s great!  Take care of yourself today."
So tired of being tired,6,meklo7,6,"I've read some posts that say they have to nap every two days. Not me, every day I have to take a 2-4 hour nap or suffer through the worst form of tiredness where I feel like a zombie for 3 hours. What a waste of time if I due take a nap and what torture I have to go through if I decide to fight it. The dosage must be too high right? There is no way this is how everybody with bipolar feels. No way I could hold down a job in this state. I am in school right now so I can take naps around my schedule."
"Currently in the ER for a medical issue and trying not to be triggered by my surroundings. Of course, I have to disclose my Bipolar I diagnosis and meds and there is such a fear and low grade paranoia of being dismissed, stigmatized, or at worst, thought to be symptomatic and sent to a psych ward.",7,mejqop,13,"Had an appointment with my PCP this morning to do some cardiac testing and she said I had to go to an emergency room immediately. I've had many traumatic experiences in hospitals and offered to make an outpatient appointment ASAP instead. She wasn't having it so now I'm in an ER bed.

Most of the staff has been OK so far but it just sucks how disorienting hospitals are in general (for everyone, not just people with mental health issues), and how staff do not make any effort to orient you on their own. I think I'm waiting for someone to take blood but who knows bc I wasn't explicitly told. My bed doesn't have a pillow, they didn't bother plugging in any of the monitors (my heart rate was super high in triage so you think they'd want to plug in the pulse monitor??), and I have to pee but IDK if they will need urine for testing later so I'm stuck holding it in. Imagine being legit manic and irritable in this setting--I would've gone off by now. 

Keep me company guys?? :("

Does anybody else feel empty inside while manic?,5,mejjcb,4,"Like I'm happy technically sure, but it still doesn't feel good. I feel good and I do things that are ill advised in an attempt to feel even better but it's never enough and there's always a void inside me that needs to be filled, nothings ever enough. Being bipolar is wack"
Memory’s of being bipolar as a child,8,meimky,7,"The more I read I become more convinced that I was bipolar as a child. I have always had this troubling memory of waking up terrified in the middle of the night around 3 or 4 years old, having the pusical of something touching or clinging to my back. At the time I describe it feeling like there was a lizard on my back. As and adult I’ve always said that it felt more like a hand. I was often severely paranoid after that and soon had the first depressive episode that I can remember. I just laid on the carpet and wanted to sink into it and die. As my childhood progressed, so did the bipolar, showing up as serious mood instability. Crying, being angry, or depressed unpredictability. 

Can anyone tell me about early onset Bipolar?"
"Bipolar 1, insomnia, and somniphobia",6,mekh3k,5,"About two or three weeks ago, my family and friends were noticing my early manic symptoms. I got unusually addicted to my social life where I would go out of my way to socialize and meet new people despite the demanding work schedule I had. I started going for late night walks and sleeping less to socialize or exercise. I didn't miss the sleep and told myself I was doing great and feeling great. I guess I didn't need the sleep was what I told myself. I started feeling invincible. 

Eventually, after my father and friends began expressing greater concern, I caved and went to see my psychiatrist. My antipsychotic dose was increased. As a result, I calmed down and popped back to baseline. Then, this week, I began swinging out to the depressive end. 

The fact is that I still cannot sleep. I'm averaging at around 3-4 hours a night and where as before I simply thought I had better things to do than sleep, now I straight up fear sleep in the same way I fear death. I'm exhausted, but the idea of sleeping terrifies me to the point of where I now would rather deprive myself of sleep entirely than even attempt a few hours. 

I've gone from energized and peppy to exhausted and miserable. Worse still, I feel confused and keep dissociating which makes walking places a new level of adventure since I can't remember how I got somewhere. My relationships are suffering because of my irritability, paranoia, and straight up bizarre behaviour. The doctor suspects I may be delusional.

I don't think I'm psychotic. It would be rather peculiar considering my recent antipsychotic dose increase. I do feel tired, I just feel so afraid of sleep that I refuse to. I can't figure out why."

can autistic/bipolar couples actually work at all?,2,meol7h,12,So I recently met a woman that I think is coming on to me recently.

Ive lived around a mom who has BPD too and so I have experience with living with people with the condition and I was just curious if autism/bipolar are typically good personally matches with each other. She seems like a pretty nice person and she seems to dot around me a lot compared to other women who are usually either neutral or treat me like an idiot because of my lack of social IQ.
All the pills I’ve been prescribed and taken off of in a short amount of time was a really traumatic experience that I pushed myself through for the sake of stability. Here’s some artwork I made expressing that.,72,me5ma4,2,
Confused and scared,2,meo5i4,6,"Hi everyone. I am 29 and just recently diagnosed with bipolar II . I haven’t told my friends and my family doesn’t agree or support my diagnosis. I am confused and scared and hoping to find some type of support. Trying to do research to better understand, and my psych appointment was so stressful I forgot to ask a few things. 
I am not looking for medical advice, but perhaps someone experienced to talk to who can offer some clarity, or recommendations of learning materials, or maybe some encouragement? I do not know anyone personally I can talk to that would understand. Thank you."
Anyone on a very low dose for their prescribed meds?,8,mefghm,5,"I was diagnosed with bipolar over two years ago, and I was prescribed a heavy dose of meds in the hospital that made me practically non-function. I get why they did that. I had not slept for days during a manic episode.

Fast forward and I have been off meds for 2 years. My post-hospital psych said I’m her easy patient. She lowered all my meds to practically nothing. Then eventually took me off everything.

I’ve had a hard time with the pandemic and have had some minor episodes over the past year. All of them had to do with alcohol (self medicating). I’m working hard to quit drinking and I think it’s a major culprit.

I saw a psych and they immediately want to put me on the heavy doses I was on in the hospital. I don’t want to do it. I won’t.

I’m highly functional with my disorder, and I say that as modestly as I can. 

But I want to be on something minimal.. for starters at least.

Anyone else out here doing the same thing? I’m looking for a Diet Coke each day, not 5 cups of Starbucks lol.

I’ve been in therapy and treatment for 4 years now and I feel way better, but not better enough to do anything I really want to do because this shit holds me back. And I hate to admit it.

Oy vey. Tattoo issue.,9,mecmkr,13,"So. I am planning on getting a tattoo today at 1:30PM CDT. All’s good, right?

WRONG. 

The one person I confide in, my husband, was not informed. I forgot to tell him that I was actually executing on my idea. I’ve been ruminating on this for months now, and finally am pulling the trigger, yet I didn’t tell him. It was also to make sure that it wasn’t an impulsive bipolar thing.

He was understandably upset. The only reason he found out was because I left a copy of the paperwork in the front seat of my car, and I don’t have tinted windows. He would have otherwise found out when he got home and saw my tattooed arm. 

I don’t know how I could have royally fucked up so badly. I comforted him the best way I knew how, and he asked me if I had any other secrets. I don’t. I love the guy, and had no idea why I didn’t just tell him that I was getting a tattoo.

Does anyone have any tips? Does the sedation wear off? Does your body get used to it? I’m going to take half a pill (12.5mg) tonight to see if I have the same effects. I want the sleep just not the hangover. I’d love to hear your experiences and tips."

Relishing a good day,2,meielt,1,"Having an upbeat Saturday after a scary night of rapid cycling on Thursday is awesome 😁🙌

I went down to my favorite bar to do some paperwork at the end of a very productive day on Thursday night and went totally manic, I was very engaging and talking a mile a minute. The owners son thanked me for the great conversation. If only he knew, haha. 

As soon as I left my self esteem puddled on the ground and was incredibly depressed on my drive home. By the time I got back to the house I was rapid cycling like crazy, wanting to die one minute and thinking of suicide and then being quite positive the next. When I was up my scalp had this tingling sensation, is that a thing? 

I eventually did something positive myself, finally took my meds, got in bed, felt better, and fell asleep in front of one of my favorite movies. 

I woke up feeling pretty good yesterday, was very productive, and kept myself out of the ditch last night despite staying up too late again. 

Today I feel great and do not feel manic at all. I love this feeling. I’m not used to feeling this way and hope that this will be the new normal. 

I’m new to this. I’m 35 and was only diagnosed this past October after a lifetime of relative instability. I’m ADHD, have generalized anxiety, and PTSD too. 

All this to say that I’m celebrating a good day of stability 😄

Cant stop ruminating,7,mea41f,5,"24F diagnosed with Bipolar II. I’ve been in a really bad spiraling depressive episode, the worst of my life after not having access to healthcare for almost a year due to losing my job during covid.

I’ve recently had some interpersonal relationship issues that were pretty intense happen that triggered and worsened my episode. Since these are the only problems in my life that I feel I have some semblance of control over I can’t stop thinking about them.

I think about the issues for hours every day along with now audibly crying every day for hours as well.  I keep trying to analyze everything and psychoanalyze everyone to try and find a reason why things happened and why it might be my fault and therefore something I can fix and how I can fix it.  I try to distract myself but always come back to it.

The best ways I’ve found of coping are sleeping and not being alone, so I’ve been sleeping all day til 5 pm and trying to plan things with people  when I have energy or spend the rest of my time with my dad.  I’m also obsessively co-ruminating  so I keep trying to talk about my issues and figure them out with others at no actual benefit to myself.  Even if I try to ignore my thoughts I end up getting exhausted from my friends rather early as I keep circling back to the thoughts. Any hobbies I have are completely uninteresting to the point where I force myself to pick something up and stop almost immediately. When people tell me to let things go I then start obsessively thinking about why I can’t let things go.

Anybody else ever experience rumination this debilitating before? This isn’t something I’ve really covered with my therapist or psych as I never really realized how bad it was until now.  Is this level of rumination common with bipolar?  

I appreciate any responses!"

Everyone leaves.  No one stays, no one loves unconditionally or keeps their word.

Why give and give only to be rejected?

Why suppress the highs of mania and lows of depression to please others?

This is who I am, I am three different people, Legion if you will, in one body.

I see myself from outside, no one knows the pain that I go through.

I can ugly cry right next to someone and they can’t even sense it.

I have perfected the art of wearing a mask, and never taking it off.

The worst part about bipolar that nobody talks about,986,gr8vff,294,"The worst part is not the mood swings or the violent intrusive thoughts that make Saw look like a romantic comedy. It is not the hypersexuality or the inability to sleep or the reckless behaviour. It is not even the suicidal and self-destructive urges that tell you that it's all hopeless so just give up.

The worst part is never truly knowing who you are. I look back at myself (text messages, Facebook messages, memories if I have any) when I was in an episode (depressive or manic) and I literally don't recognise that person. I find myself saying ""Am I really like that? Who is that person?""

Combine that with the dissociation (not being in my own body for the majority of the time) and I don't feel like I know myself or ever will. Does anyone else get this or is it just me?"

Things I wish I'd known about bipolar,904,3tzvqo,94,"I wrote this up to process my experiences this year with the thought of maybe sharing it online. I already bugged everyone on facebook about what I was going through when I was going through it though, so maybe not. I thought I'd post it here anyway. Maybe it's helpful to some people.

**Mania feels like enlightenment**

Mania brought out huge emotions that I never knew were in me. I felt deep feelings of love some days, anger others and an all-over general disregard for consequences. It doesn’t matter what I did, I felt validated.

The thoughts I had were all-important. I had a right to whatever good thing life threw at me and I was convinced I could get along with everyone and if I couldn’t, well it was their fault.

Having such a big shift in your thought feels spiritually important when you’re in it. I’m not the only person who's suddenly found their spiritual side out of nowhere.

You see madness coming as you approach it and then suddenly, *wham*, you’re Neo and you have to save the world. This is different, you’re not mad, you have purpose. Life isn’t a confusing march to death after all!

**Depression taught me there isn’t a *real* me**

I thought I was someone who enjoyed exercise, but one day my body felt heavy and I couldn’t go to the gym any more. I thought I was someone who was intelligent, but one day my brain was like treacle and I couldn’t do my job. I thought I was someone with a sense of humour, but one day I couldn’t even come up with words. I thought I was someone with friends and family who I loved, but then I trusted no-one.

You get back to this blank state of nihilistic solipsism and have to rebuild one block at a time.

**Normality is the bit that feels unstable**

I’m fairly convinced most people go through life feeling a little bit fragile and unsure of themselves. They know an unkind word could send them into a pit or a kind word in the right place could make them feel on top of the world.

A mood disorder is the negation of all of that. You feel one way. Manic, it doesn’t matter what someone says to you, you are on a mission. Of course they’re telling you you’re crazy, you’re doing something no-one has done before. People thought every great person was crazy. But soon you’ll prove them all wrong.

People humour me when I’m depressed. Or if they’re not humouring me it’s only because they don’t know my deep, terrible secrets. And they’re all terrible too. I'll remember every little thing they ever said or did to me. They feel obligated to me as a friend, of course, but I know they’d rather be with anyone else.

**Mood swings make me dumb**

I like to think I’m reasonably intelligent, but trying to do my job whilst going through a depressive episode was hopeless. I had a system where I’d have evernote open and write timestamped notes as I was working. I’d lose focus every minute and have to look at the list of things I’d been doing. Even then my brain was like treacle.

And amnesia is a huge side-effect too. At the deepest depression, your entire mental vision is filled with your regrets. You can’t remember the joy you felt on your childhood holidays or even what you were doing that morning.

Strangely, you can remember everything negative. Not just about you either, about everybody.

I hope I never take my life, but knowing I get to a place where I'm retarded; can’t remember anything positive; where my body feels heavy and I feel generally like a worthless, unattached piece of shit with no sense of identity scares me. It’s not a game. I know what I value about my life now, but when I’m in that pit, those memories aren’t available to me any more.

**You have to learn trust**

Losing touch with reality and having a brain that didn’t work meant I had to trust other people to think for me. Whether it was nurses, doctors, family or friends. I have been severely retarded for months this year and I am infinitely grateful to everyone who put up with that.

You can’t judge how mad you are yourself. Your brain’s entire internal logic changes. All the time you’ll feel like whatever you’re doing is the most natural thing in the world. I have done bizarre stuff, but it all seemed normal, at the time.

There’s a point when you have to toss your life’s keys to someone else if you want to be safe.

**Apologies are complex**

Do you apologise for what you said manic?

Do you apologise for being bad at your job depressed?

Do you apologise for making inappropriate advances, losing your cool, getting in fights?

Do you apologise for not answering calls, not tidying up after yourself, being surly?

Do you apologise knowing that if people can’t put up with you being unreliable sometimes, you’re going to have to apologise again and again?

It’s fair to say I regret a huge portion of my life. There are people I’m probably never going to talk to again. And all through the episodes, it’s still me, but what do I do with that? I know what I did, I know why I upset people. And I know I’ll probably do similarly stupid things again.

**Mental illness is fundamentally lonely**

At a certain point in mania, I got frustrated that no-one thought I was telepathic like I knew I was and depression told me that no-one out there cared or understood. In deepest depression I can’t even vocalise what I’m feeling, so what use is a hotline?

It was actually helpful to be sectioned whilst manic. Being around other people who were uncertain about the nature of reality was somewhat comforting."

"(hypo)mania and depression aren't just intense versions of happiness and sadness, they're entirely different states of mind",754,k4gor5,71,"I started Lamictal a couple months ago and things have been getting a lot better for me; I'm a lot more stable. 


A couple days ago I learned that my grandma is getting pretty sick and that there isn't a whole lot that anyone can do. Obviously we can't visit because of COVID. So it's a sad time. (She's had a long and good life. I've been lucky to have her in my life. It's natural and everyone eventually dies, but it's still sad, you know?)


Anyway, at the risk of sounding like I have a heart of stone, the sadness I feel about the situation with my grandma is a lot easier to deal with than depressive episodes. It's an emotional reaction to an event. I'm sad, but I'm still myself. 


Depressive episodes are *nothing* like this sadness. During those episodes it feels like black tar is oozing through my veins instead of blood. I've never felt happiness before and I never will. Everything is dark and there isn't an escape. 


Then when the pendulum swings the other way it feels like my body is on vibrate, but *just* fast enough to be at a high-pitched hum. It's like I'm watching the part of my favorite movie that comes *right before* the climax but the climax never comes. I *want* to do everything but if I sit down to do anything I'll explode.


Normal happiness? Nothing like that.


It seems like happiness and sadness are *reactions*. They're the effect, not the cause. Depression and mania are the opposite for me. They occur by themselves and affect other parts of my life. I'm not feeling happy because I'm listening to a good song, I'm playing the first 10 seconds of 15 different songs because I'm looking for a way to externalize the intense energy I'm feeling. 


Happiness and sadness change the way I feel, but depression and mania change the way I see."

My mood stabilizers made it really hard for me to adjust the stimulant dosage and I developed a pill taking phobia but I am finally stable.

Only took me the better part of a decade, seven houses, twenty-something part-time jobs, dozens of doctors, five times as many medications, thousands of break-downs, two hospitalizations, one Baker Act enforcement, four-plus SOs, too much money, so many books, not enough sleep, and a fucking determined heart.   


I'm so proud of myself, guys.  And relieved.  I actually finished something!  Something big (for me)."

Being told I'm high functioning is not comforting,739,f6cz6f,126,"My therapist likes to tell me about famous bipolar people and other patients of hers that are so much worse off than me. It makes it feel like she and no else understands how fucking hard it is to drive to work in a depressive episode without purposefully crashing my car or to not quit my job in a manic episode and go live in a treehouse with a harem of strange men selling drugs for a living. I'm grateful that even at my worst with psychosis, I'm still of sound enough mind to not do that stuff as much as I convince myself that's the only way to be happy and be myself, but it's STILL not comforting to hear that those thought patterns ""aren't that bad"".  

Just a small rant I had to get out. Shout out to my fellow high functionals.

EDIT TO ADD thanks for sharing all your own experiences. My therapist absolutely does not say things like this maliciously, it's just a thing I think a lot of people thinks sounds comforting. Imagine saying ""Think of how lucky you are! It could be so much worse!"" to someone who just lost a toe to diabetes. Of course they're glad they didn't lose a whole leg, but it also sucks a lot to lose a toe. Inner peace is my lost toe. Anyway, this therapist doesn't know much about bipolar, so I am going back to the drawing board in the near future to find someone I relate to a little more as far as the darker goings on in my head. Thanks again everyone."

Edit : Thank you for all the kind words! It really means a lot to me. I went to bed early yesterday, when this post had like 15 upvotes, I never expected it to get nearly 500 upvotes and lots of comments! (Also long time lurker here, this was my first post ever.) Right now I'm getting ready to go to my second day. I'll be back home in like 9 hours from now and then I'll respond to the comments as good as I can. If you have any particular questions, just go ahead and ask them. Happy to help.

Edit 2 : Just had a really long (and great) second day and I replied to a good amount of comments. If you people want to know specific things about my internship or how it is to have seen both sides, or some sort of updates once in a while, feel free to ask/say so. These 2 first days have been pretty overwhelming, but I'm really happy that I could reply to your great comments so I can talk about it. You're all great people. Oh, and this is the first time I ever got something on Reddit ! Thank you for the silver. <3"
