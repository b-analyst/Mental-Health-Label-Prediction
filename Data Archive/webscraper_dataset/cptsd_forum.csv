1,"29 year old male.  I have never been diagnosed with CTPSD but I have read about it and can relate to much of it. I didn't want to write loads about my background, but anxiety, OCD, social anxiety, insomnia, and a fragmented identity have been central to my life.

Any ways, has anyone some friendships which 'don't feel right' and which only sustained themselves because you never had the confidence to move away from the friendship? This is one of my biggest roadblocks that I'm struggling to come to terms with.

2 examples.

Guy 1: Let's call him Andrew. Andrew and I were best friends in primary school, it became apparent to me throughout high school and early college years that Andrew and I were quite different. Different interests, different taste in things, different demeanour, different in many ways. In truth, I never felt excited about hanging out with him and I still don't. However Andrew also had a bit of a capricious personality for years, particularly when drunk, which made me scared of ever ignoring him or drifting away from the friendship incase he reacted badly. Co-dependency emerged, whereby I pretended to like him to avoid conflict. Andrew's capricious personality went away, he became more at ease with himself, and instead my co-dependency transformed into simply not wanting to hurt Andrew's feelings. In doing so I have hurt myself by not being happy. Andrew has asked me to be groomsman at his wedding next year, which doesn't feel right to me as I am not excited by our friendship at all, but it is what it is.

Group 1: This is a group of persons, not just one guy. They were my friends for a few years from the age of 22-26, partly because of confidence issues but also I guess I just didn't know many other people at the time. We did have some stuff in common, but music is very important to me and they were not on the same wavelenght as me when it came to music. At all. For example I never got the chance to go to music venues to see artists I liked, or go to bars and nightclubs I enjoy, because these guys were not into it and were in fact very narrow minded. And in general, I just didn't feel I clicked with them. For example there were groups or categories of people I would like and feel at home with, who they never felt at home with. It never felt right to me, but it just happened that it was the group of people I lived with at the time and was around with at the time. I guess the inability to drift away from this group was partly because of confidence issues, but maybe also just the reality I didn't have any other friends at the time.

Thankfully at the age of 26 I moved to another city which had the exact music scene I wanted, and met loads of new people who were defo more 'up my street'. From 26 and half, to 28 I had an absolute blast and made up for those lost years. Corona obviously came then, but at that point I actually felt burnt out from all the socializing and partying.

However even though I had a great time the past few years, the past was hanging over. Why was I still friends with Andrew even though I felt no connection? Furthermore, despite the present being great, I still had so many regrets for the years I wasted with 'group 1'. People would ask me about different experiences about clubbing and music, and it felt like an empty hole was missing. Also I'm still in a Whatsapp group with Group 1, which means it's hard to escape from them.

My friends over the years should have been people like me - into music, politics, small interest in sport, and generally chilled. I had some of them over the years, but the majority were not and I never really clicked with them. Thankfully my friends in my new city are on the same wavelenght and I was at least able to enjoy my mid-late 20's.

Summary - Some of my closest friendships to me don't feel 'right' at all and only came about due to lack of confidence and co-dependency. I have no way of escaping this, as is the case with the wedding next year. It doesn't feel right at all, my identity with these people doesn't feel right at all, and I don't know how to deal with it. It actually causes me severe anguish and frustration, I sometimes feel like physically hurting these people who are supposed to be my friends. Part of me just feels like being absolutely direct with them and ending these friendships, but that's just gonna result in hurt and pain - particularly for Andrew when I have his wedding to go to next year."
2,"Hi, does anyone here have any physical effects from cptsd, I have many..I learned about them on the website ptsduk... I'm looking for anyone that knows about or has experience of this...I'm very physically weak, physically ageing quite fast ..  peace...."
3,"I've been going through a shit ton of trauma lately. I posted recently and I'm trying to figure out if I have psychotic disorder or not. I was in grad school and I had to drop out. I noticed that my language is all messed up now. I remembered trauma from a very young age. My teachers said I learned to write weird. I always had trouble with my left and my right, with distinguishing v's and z's...... but other than I've always been really smart and have a great vocabulary. Now I get letters and words messed up all the time. My mind moves really fast too. I think that has to do with it as well. Any thoughts?"
4,Hey y'all. I have c-PTSD and a never ending amount of trauma. I was recently diagnosed with Graves Disease as well which is not under control in the slightest. I've been experiencing some audio/visual hallucinations I think.... they're more like distortions. I can recognize that they're not real. I'm just really scared it may be something else. Part of my story is a very deep and significant history of traumatization in Mental Health settings so I have a lot of internalized stigma. Has anyone else experienced hallucinations with this disorder?
5,"I started a new job as a lab technician on Tuesday. On Friday morning I walked out of the lab because I had a sudden panic attack. I drove home and emailed my boss to say that I quit.

I feel short of breath and overwhelmed constantly. Financially and professionally this is taking a toll.

If I weren't living with my mother I would be completely screwed. 

I'm completely incapacitated by my trauma right now. The people in my life don't understand and it makes me feel so alone.

Can anyone relate?"
6,"I have Complex PTSD, so I've learned to wait till the very depressed times or those of high anxiety (or aggression) to pass. Sometimes the emotions are relived (flashbacks but emotions only), so they have nothing to do with the present moment, while at other times the emotions are from present circumstances.

Lately, I've been feeling, I guess a meta depression, where I'm depressed from reliving depressed emotions, and just the overall process of waiting for these times to just pass. I'm also feeling very isolated as most people simply do not relate or understand the added layers of complexity.

It feels like another level to what is a rather hellish situation, and I won't lie, I think about my own death a lot these days. Nothing definitive in regards to suicide, I make sure anything I could use is locked away, and generally ensure there's enough impediments in place to discourage impulsivity.

But the thoughts are distressing, and at times, tempting. What they aren't is comforting. I'm reminded constantly of how isolated I feel.

People in my life who mean well feel distant and self-absorbed. Every nuance in behavior of others is analyzed and found calloused, thoughtless, and motives questioned.

I know it's the PTSD that fuels all of this, but it's so difficult not to be swayed by such convincing inner monologue when it's just you, alone with these thoughts.

Every misunderstanding from friends, family, or a significant other pierces so directly to the heart, even though I know that's not their intent. Every attempt to explain how I feel and why is reflected back distorted as those closest to me try to understand. Their frustration, and at times, anger just hurts me more. Thoughts ever so cruelly snatch at these experiences as though to prove, ' See, they don't know you, and they never will. They will be at your funeral mourning a person who was never you.'

In either case, thanks for providing a forum where I can voice my thoughts."
7,"I've not been around here for a while. Lots has changed for good. But I'm suddenly just. so. sad. And helpless feeling.

It's the worst. Some of it is because I'm not externalising negative feelings onto anyone else anymore so am having to sit with them.

Some of it is because /big changes in my life/

Trying hard not to believe that some of it is a punishment for trying to do things which make me happy and fulfilled. But that way of thinking sure feels attractive.

This isn't a question. Just a vent."
8,"I am feeling ashamed and humiliated by the flashbacks and nightmares I am having at the moment. I physically feel the implements that were put into my body and other physical pain. I don’t know how to deal with this. I feel like a freak. I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this and how they handle it. I am also wetting myself a lot whenever I have a flashback or a nightmare. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to trigger anyone, but I really feel lost with this. I’m sorry."
9,"I wanted a centralized thread for everyone to discuss the process as they get down to business.

Feel free to share stories of treatments and the process, results, etc., advice for specific situations, rankings of various activities and treatments.

Good luck on your journeys!"
10,I have suffered from PTSD for many years now. But I  still realy struggle to manage it and the triggers...mood swings...hopelessness of it all. A lot of times I just wish I could die as I just feel mentally and emotionally tortured inside. Don't know Me anymore. Can't seem to find a way out of it. So exhausted going round and round trying to find help with it.  Pretty alone in world. Can't function well enough to keep relationship with anyone going as too much pressure on my head. In fact I can't seem to handle any pressure at all..even the tiniest amount. Does anyone else suffer this? My mood is one extreme to another. Unstable and tired. What actual help/ therapy is there available for this? It ok to be told that is what I suffer by a doctor but what's the solution? Desperate here. Realy am. Please any advice?
11,"Hello.

I feel drained. I've been dealing with too much in the last decade, my faith in humanity is rather low, except for my significant other, they bring light into my life... I'm overwhelmed and in physical and emotional pain almost on a daily basis, but I truly want to get better... I don't want to get too much into this now, I just want to write it here to be taken into account...

This afternoon I had a fight with my significant other, because I felt left out and neglected by them. We always eat together, we have a schedule for that. It was time to eat, I was hungry, but they still wanted to work and finish something. I understood this, and I told them to please let me know when they were ready, they agreed to text/call me as soon as they were ready. But they made me wait extra, they decided to take their time and go prepare a drink and didn't even tell me because they felt like it and thought ""it was faster and more practical this way since they were almost done with what they had to do anyway."" I ended up waiting for an hour but it felt like much longer, especially when I found out why they had taken longer.

It triggered a hurricane of emotions in me, and those emotions turned into a barrage of questions that I poured on them (things like, ""do you not love me enough to at least let me know or wait to have a drink with me during the meal since you were going to finish soon anyway? Do you not care enough about me to be considerate of the fact that I'm hungry and have been waiting for you?""). And the less they were able to answer, the more unloved and desperate I felt, the more I yearned for them to apologize and be kind and gentle and loving towards me, but they were getting (understandably...) defensive instead... I just wish they had been reassuring and protective even, as soon as I'm shown love it's easier for me to snap out of this state. But I can't depend on that, and today was the proof, it escalated so much... I wanted it to stop, I almost break up with them. I wanted to disappear.

I know that what they did wasn't alright, but it wasn't as terrible as it felt (life or death almost)... I wish I could have stopped the storm of emotions and told them in a more assertive and calm way, I know they would have understood. They can't possibly be always loving towards me, no matter what... I know it's unrealistic of me to want this so desperately... they're human, they get tired too, they can't be emotionally available 24/7.

I feel extremely guilty and ashamed because I just can't seem to stop it. With the situation getting harder for me in the last few years (long story), I've become so much more sensitive, anxious, tense, hypervigilant, needy, etc... I'm tired of how much this hurts us emotionally and mentally... I feel like a burden, like they'd be better if I wasn't around... but in truth, if I disappeared, that would harm them so much more... and I do want to have a happy, peaceful, and healthy future with them...

How can I protect my significant other and myself from this? How can I stop it from spiraling out of control? Especially when they're unable to calm themselves down too, it triggers me so much more when they get angry/defensive...

I already meditate on a daily basis and take care of myself in other ways, I need to know if someone knows a way to stop it before it happens or while it's happening... I'm aware and reasonable when regulated, but when I get triggered like this I'm not, I have all kinds of pessimistic, angry and depressing thoughts about everything... they spiral so fast and hurt like Hell.

Thank you for reading me..."
12,"Over the last two years, I have experienced extreme distress over certain thoughts and experiences that I would have. It’s possible that I have always felt this sense of discomfort and distress, but I didn’t start getting a more amplified negative physical and emotionally reaction to these thoughts and experienced until recently.  

Thoughts/experiences that trigger me:

Feeling uncomfortable and anxious when people are unresponsive (e.g., not giving me eye contact; not being genuine when talking to me; their body language is closed off and not open to me; not being emotionally attuned). Then my body begins to shut down and I get into a “freeze” response. I can’t exactly escape the situation but I can’t fight it with either. 
When I am constantly questioning my sexuality. There are moments when I don’t question it and I feel better, but the moment sexuality shows up in my thoughts again (and I can’t seem to stop thinking about it), I start getting distressed as well as getting into this intense state of fear - that I’m not who I thought I was. I begin to feel afraid that I am actually asexual. I think this is attributed to my fear of lack of control. 
When people try to get to close too me, or the opposite - they avoid me. Although I crave being close to others I also have a desire to avoid people at the same time. I suffer from chronic loneliness too. 
When people question my choices and who I am (a lot of the centered around my sexuality), I get extremely distressed, insecure, and there is a feeling of humiliation in the mix

These are among the biggest that seem to be triggering for me. I am not sure if they can be attributed to c-ptsd. I went through a lot bullying and emotional neglect as a child. I’m not sure why the topic of a lot of these triggers are about my sexual orientation, but I’m hoping I can get some non-professional advice from this forum."
13,"I'm terrible at telling my story and I don't even know if I belong here, but something inside is telling me to write on here so here goes... ***TRIGGER WARNING - discussion of emotional neglect and abuse.

I am a 27 y.o. female, and for all of my life I have always had an anxious disposition. As a child, I never felt close to anyone in my family (except for my mother but we have a codependent relationship which I just realized recently). I didn't notice until the last few years or so that I don't have the relationship with my father that my friends have with theirs. He is emotionally distant, neglectful, and sometimes emotionally abusive, especially towards my mother. She once told me recently that he's pretty much a sociopath. No empathy. No emotional capacity whatsoever. He has always been this way, but I never realized any of this.. that I actually was emotionally neglected and abused throughout my childhood.

My father never once made an effort to get to know me or understand who I am, nor would he ever notice if I had a problem going on in my life. Any emotions I would express around him he would either dismiss them completely or tell me that they weren't real. ""You don't really feel that way."" ""You don't mean it."" He would never keep any eye contact with me, as if I do not even exist or am worth talking to. After everything that has happened with the pandemic, my father not once checked in with me (I unfortunately have been living with him). Every time I am with him, I feel even lonelier then when I am actually alone.

I had a cat recently who had attacked me, and when my father came home and I told him what had happened, showing him my bloody arms and legs (it a was horrible attack. I don't want to get into detail.) clearly in pain, but he didn't feel sorry for me. No emotions to be detected. He just looked at me and gave me an awkward smirk. Didn't want to take me to get cared for or didn't bother to try to do it himself. He just went back to business as usual, reading the newspaper and watching tv. I had to drive myself to the fucking urgent care with my bleeding arms and legs to get a shot and an expensive medical bill. I was there alone. That felt like a turning point for me.

I stopped bothering to talk to him because anytime I ever tried to connect, he wouldn't follow through. I sometimes feel guilty for not giving him my own attention. But why is it up to the child to pick up the pieces? To this day, he is unwilling to have a relationship with me. Every time I am around him I feel unloved but at the same time, I want to avoid him like the plague. He never makes the effort to tell me he loves me. He doesn't feel like my dad. He's just a person that I live with. I honestly probably won't be that sad when he finally passes.

As an adult, I feel that I have exhibited many symptoms that could be related to C-PTSD. I feel that I have severe abandonment issues - more like a fear of rejection. At the same time, I avoid close relationships. Ironically, I have never had a serious relationship before so it's like, ""how could you know what abandonment feels like if you had never been in a situation where abandonment was possible?"" Maybe it has to do with my father? I would hear stories of women who constantly seek male approval in toxic relationships, but that has never been me at all. I avoid everyone. So the ""clinging to relationships"" box is not checked off in my case.

I experienced a lot of bullying in high school too. I have major trust issues and struggle to connect with others. I am unable to open myself emotionally. I'm such a people pleaser and perfectionist, I would put people's needs often before my own. Assuming everything is my fault? Check. I am hyper-vigilent in my surroundings and struggle with anxiety, depression, and identity issues (centered around my sexual identity). I am always jumpy when people get too close to me, and I would constantly hear other people asking me why I am I so nervous and anxious all the time. I go emotionally numb when conflicts arise and cannot function almost. My body just shuts down. I often have feelings of shame and guilt. I went to see a psychiatrist for an anxiety diagnosis but she could not find a proper diagnosis that fits so I was diagnosed with ""unspecified anxiety."" Obviously I was not happy about this.

All I know right now is that I have anxiety and depression... but I have a feeling there is trauma there in the mix. Possibly OCD too. I know that emotional neglect is not the same as sexual or physical abuse, but I feel that I am experiencing similar PTSD symptoms. I just know something is not right with me."
14,"I’m worried this is my new normal. I feel changed and different. I’ve been trying to get back to myself but I don’t know if I can. Because that person pushed so much down and didn’t notice certain things. But now I notice them and I’m not okay with them, I’m not okay with so many things about this world. My perspective has changed in a lot of ways. What if I’ll never feel at ease again? What if I’m always going to have to push so hard every day to be okay? What if I’m never going to get my libido back? What if I’m going to be so overwhelmed for the rest of my life that I won’t be able to participate in life? My brain is overloaded, I can’t think. I can’t make conversation very well. Not that I could well before, but it feels a lot worse. Everything feels a lot worse. I’m worried it’s going to be like this for the rest of my life. I’m crying most days. I’ve been struggling to eat for months. I feel like I’m drowning in a drowning world that’s trying not to drown, but...every faucet is always on. I’ve tried the positivity. It saved my life once. But I can’t fake that stuff anymore. I can’t push anything more down."
15,"I’m thinking back to feelings of being unwanted. I have to give myself reality checks. I hate this part of mental illness. Sometimes it takes a lot for me to reach out to a friend, let alone ask them to hang out. I did that tonight, but the question (mentioned in the second half of the text) wasn’t addressed. Only the first half of the text message was. It made me think back to how many times I’ve put myself out there to do something scary and I get shot down somehow, or there was some weird obstacle, mistake, or fumble in the way. Even if it’s just in my head. Which may be the case because maybe she just didn’t finish reading the whole thing, which might’ve been done in a hurry. She was with another friend at the time, I know that. This person has done nothing to make me think she doesn’t want me as a friend to hang out with and get closer to. I feel so stuck. I don’t know how to respond. Do I say, “Hey, did you finish reading my text?” How do you even do that without making it awkward? I agonize over this shit. I’m so tired of it. I feel trapped. All these subtle difficulties in communication kill me. I keep trembling."
16,"Tonight..I realized that I am a survivor of childhood sexual, physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. I acknowledged my emotional and psychological abuse since I started therapy and treatment at 17. I usually told people I had trauma from bullying in school and mentioned only in initial sessions that I was abused early in by a babysitter..and briefly mentioning the covert abuse from my father. After four years in recovery so far, I accepted that more than that has happened especially with the abuse from my family finally ending when I escaped the house in October 10th. I am finding a therapist and other ways to truly heal. I have other ways I will..and I want to utilize in more resources. I am however afraid to tell someone the full truth..so what has anyone here done when scared to admit the severity of prolonged trauma to a therapist or an kind of social service assistance? I am from the US by the way."
17,"Hello,

I apologize for using SOS in the title of the post but I am really disturbed by what I am feeling.
The problem is that I was bullied for a very long time and when I finally stopped I became hypervigilant about anyone using that particular word for bullying me. The word used to bully me was the N-word.

Now many years later I am still hyper vigilant regarding that word but now I am worrying that what if I get triggered by even the first letter of that word (the word was the N-word and the letter is N) and now I am noticing the letter “N” everywhere.

I am hypervigilant regarding the existing triggers and I really don’t want more to add to the list.


It is like my sensitivity is decreasing and the triggers are increasing.

What is the problem which I am facing and how to stop more triggers from being added?


Pls help!

Thanks"
18,"Finally finding out my whole life from being hurt by countless people online the most and a few situations in person. By being severely hurt by people in so many ways as well traumatic situations sadly as well happening to me. I finally know what I have and it's  C-PTSD and I fully accept I have it.  I have now in my life a truly wonderful therapist who specializes in that field ( After half my life of searching for professional  help ) who is helping so much as I make truly unbelievable tremendous progress with her every time I see her. She helped get my mother and sister on board on so many ways they could also help me and better support me even more as well in my healing journey.

Since sadly they never understood or get for years my pain and suffering I was going though thus we then argued about it all the time, it strainly my relationshipwith them severely. It also making my relationship with them really not great nor healthy for my healing journey, so years they never could truly fully help me  get better with my mental health and my now C-PTSD. However  this year now after my wonderfully and also  totally awesome  help from my therapist by speaking to them both explaining  all I went through to make sense to them my struggle. Our now relationships between  all three of us is so much stronger  and extremely better between all of us.

 Truly all thanks to my therapist by speaking to them about what I've go through  and struggled with for years, they finally get and understand me better for the first time. My relationship with my mother and sister who help me out so much in my life in so many was, I'd be truly lost with out them and the help and the support they give me even before finding my therapist best they could. They are both truly my rocks, very best friends and my sister even being a 2nd mother to me. They finally understand me truly more and are helping me so much best they can to also heal my trauma and helping me learn to let go, forgive and focus on the present. Never to dweal or letting my past that hurt me so much my whole anymore. Now I'm extremely thriving overcoming my C-PTSD not letting it defined me anymore, so it doesn't effect me anymore and run my life.

 That I can finally find my true peace as well  happiness in my life again or even for the very first time. I wrote about what I've been through a bit on here already my story. I wanted to share my thoughts on this and how I won't let my C-PTSD win anymore and effect me as well. It's going be still very tough and I will have off not good days as well still. However I know I can and will overcome this. Also hopefully anyone who else suffers with this as well can too heal and become healthier,  stronger and find peace in their lives. It might take  for you as me still time but it can be done and you can live better and love yourself fully  and enjoy your life."
19,"Can somebody tell me
I feel a lot of guilt and shame for my past actions
 Does it ever go away? Do the guilt and shame ever go?
Thanks for listening"
20,"Hello my fellow traumatics. Wanna get angry? Wanna get REAL ANGRY?! This is a war that we are fighting and its time to start winning. Our care systems failed us and Its time to start making some noise about our backup systems that failed us. You suffered and that's wrong. But we can end suffering here. We know those warning signs. Chances are you wanted to work in care and got put off because you couldn't handle your own emotions. This. ends. here!

SHOUT

USE. YOUR. VOICE

We survived. we'eve adapted. but now, we overcome.
We are survivors! through all life had thrown at us we didn't back down! We won. We can now ask for proper help. But there are people out there like us that still think that what they experienced is the norm. We need to help them before they become like us. I never want any child to experience the pain I did.

Psychology has come a long way, but it still has a lot more to go. It's about time that we bring everyone else up to speed..

I'm using the energy I had to use to protect myself to now help protect others.

If you were failed by ""care"" systems then speak out against them. Don't let others fall prey to them.

I'm writing up a complaint about my mother's facility and my school as we speak.

I was put in the care of the crisis team. I needed help and reached out and no one reached back! I was told to go to the GP and get my medication increased to deal with what seemed to be anxiety and depression, to which I've recently on just found that my actual condition is CPTSD.

I feel angry and disgusted at the level of care that I received during the course of my childhood. I talked to teachers who told me to speak with another CHILD because her brother had autism. HER BROTHER!... not her PRIMARY CAREGIVER. I had no help and no one got social services involved. I was a CHILD on my own left with a STRANGER whilst my mother was receiving mental health care and institutionalised for trying to kill/hurt herself. This system left me in the care of a STRANGER. I have been living my entire life thinking something was wrong with me, when instead the NHS failed me.

My mother was treated and even though now that she has left, she is receiving no social support work even though she is a constant risk to herself/ and possibly others.

As far as I'm concerned my ABUSE and NEGLECT stops here. I need help and currently, my only available help is the same people who failed my mother.

STEP UP! or I'm going to be making some noise.


Also here's a little picture I draw to commiserate my journey to getting better :3"
21,"I am trying everything within me to not lose it and self-harm as well as make this week my last week. I feel like after six attempts, working towards freedom, accept myself, going no contact with toxic people, trying to accept that I need help, and lifestyle changes..I honestly feel like I have no choice but to die. I am a citizen with missing documents, abusive parents, and very little support. I listen to so many stories of success and see many that get justice. I see great things happening to other people. I have a glimpse of that and that it gets taken away. I tried to go to the law and DSS..none of them took this seriously. I am afraid to be on the phone now because I am afraid that I will be judged. I am already ashamed to be alive. I have been discarded even by those who treated me. I had to go out of my home state to receive help. My father won't stop trying to hoover and keep my social security card. I have no proof of much abuse because my sister was the center of attention. I experienced trauma symptoms since I was 3. My parents even lied when I spoke my first words. I remember my first abusive babysitter..I never asked for much in my life. I haven't even got new clothes officially since I was 15. I tried cleaning so much and no one tried to help me. Until my school got involved, my mom took slow time to get help even confiding having suicidal ideation. I feel like no one wanted me to live and when they heard I wanted to die, they told me what I wanted to hear for their benefit. Yet.. I feel like the world isn't for me despite how much I love life. I just feel officially I don't deserve it. Life is only for a certain type of people. Even if after being honest, hard-working, and humble or confident or happy or sad or logical..no one gives a fuck. All because people who abused me the most are the most ""charismatic"". I really feel like I talked myself off the ledge..for nothing. My family doesn't even truly care if I suffer."
22,"Is anyone else always constantly overwhelmed? Even when I’ve got not much going on, I still get overwhelmed. There is pressure coming from all sides. I’m having a hard time accepting that this is the way life is. There is so much pressure to be responsible and being responsible for anything gives me anxiety. How am I supposed to have a career and help people when I haven’t even figured out how to be at ease? I’m trying positive self-talk, I’m in therapy, I try to validate my own feelings...It’s like I’m in a constant state of overwhelm. I just want to feel like I’m good. Like I’m okay and aren’t constantly doing something wrong. I want to have confidence in my capabilities. Right now I don’t and it’s terrifying me because I have to get a job. It’s been months since I’ve worked. But I have to now. And I’m so scared that I won’t be capable. I don’t have confidence in the way my brain works. When I get anxious around people, I get a freeze response and my brain sometimes goes blank. I can’t think and I don’t have much to say. 
Good lord. There’s a lot I’m worried about. All the time. Any tips to help with constant overwhelm, the freeze/fawn response, and deep insecurity about my own mental structures? And deep insecurity about friendships..ugh. I wish I felt like I had more control over my life and myself."

27,"Hi Everyone

I've recently come to realise that I have cPTSD. The trauma comes from years of bullying at secondary school as well as a very critical father.

I regularly experience emotional flashbacks, crushing toxic shame, a vicious inner critic, depression and social anxiety. The fight/flight response is activated during an emotional flashback and when this happens I always freeze. If it is an intense emotional flashback then the sympathetic nervous system becomes hyperaroused which often leads to sweating and occasionally facial blushing.

The flashbacks range in intensity but are often stimulated in situations where I'm with strangers, especially white people since it was white people who traumatised me.

I'd like to know if anyone has experienced something similar and what the possible treatments are.

I've tried the following;

CBT - Didn't work
MDMA - It helped me to access those traumatic memories so now I'm able to talk about it openly with people without becoming too upset
Meditation - It helps to ground me

Has anyone tried something else that has helped to cure them?"
28,"I am a survivor of sustained emotional abuse from early childhood. I've separated from family because of it but with significant health issues. Trying to get a diagnosis to account for my symptoms has been difficult. But C-PTSD describes me perfectly. I have asked that to be considered and have been told it is not a legitimate diagnosis unlike a personally disorder that they are pushing which I do not match the criteria for - in at least one very  significant category.

What did the psychiatrist mean when saying C-PTSD isn't a diagnosis?"
29,"I've been reading this book and have now finished part one, Overview. @AliceinWonderland is also reading and I wanted to set up this thread. Anyone else who is familiar with the book or who has questions is welcome to post.

The book is really well written, each idea presented in a small chunk. I also love the non-clinical language. It feels so validating. 

I'm already finding the ideas incredibly helpful. Too much to break down now but it really is helping with my recent efforts to stop seeing myself as intrinsically defective. 

The emotional flashbacks section was really well put, first time I have understood the concept. This understanding was followed by ""Ah! So that is what is going on with me!""

The book is also helping me to begin to feel... (whisper it) as if I maybe starting to like myself a little!? :sorcerer: It has also introduced me to my new favourite word, 'parentdectomy' :D"

31,"I try my best to be myself, but for some reason I just can’t seem to do it. I say things I don’t mean, I behave in ways I don’t recognize, I say things I end up disagreeing with (things that make me cringe), and I freeze/fawn around people. I feel like I’m pushing my friends away, but I’m also prone to painful over-analyzation and self-reflection. Myself, other people, the world...nothing ever seems certain. Nothing seems for sure and solid. Clear. I just wish I knew what was real and true. I wish I could start over. Does anyone feel like this? I would really like to know. I’ve been trying to stick with meditation, I’m on meds now, I have a bit more structure in my life, I keep a bullet journal to stay on track, I’m in therapy, I have a coping toolbox. I’m making a bunch of effort to help myself get better so that I can not only feel confident and free, but also so I can love others better.

Some of what I'm experiencing has all the hallmarks of trauma, but the feelings aren't attached to any memories. My therapist says she thinks it likely that memories will attach themselves to these feelings as we go forward, but I can't help but worry that there's nothing, that nothing happened and I'm just somehow making this all up for attention, or something. 

So I guess I'm just after reassurance that others have had similar experiences. This may also be the wrong forum, so feel free to move if so."
36,"I know people mean well when they say this. Even I've said it to others who have survived abuse as well. The truth is I really don't draw any comfort from this sentiment. I'd feel better if I was the only one. I'd feel better if nobody else knew how I feel, knows what it's like to feel terror so severe that your brain just malfunctions when trying to process the trauma and is stuck on an infinite loop. 

When people say ""you're not alone"" what they really mean is ""it happened again to someone else."" I'd gladly serve time in this hell if it meant nobody else would ever find themselves here too. Let me be lonely here so I'd at least know the world is changing for the better."
37,"Hi

I've been working on my MH seriously for some years. 

I have never been diagnosed with anything. I am aware that CPTSD can only be diagnosed* after an in depth interview with a suitably qualified professional but I now suspect that CPTSD what I have been struggling with. 

I say suspect because 'denial' again but the truth is I (un)comfortably meet the reputable academic diagnostic criteria I have found online. I have also found that it is only on sub-forums for CPTSD that I (finally) see my experience of life being described by others.

A diagnosis is only valuable to me if it results in proper treatment; however, my memories of childhood are so vague that I doubt EMDR would be effective. It is more a totality of experience than specific memories that I need to address.

I have previously had therapy that focused on identifying and integrating the different parts of my personality, the psychotherapist also helped me to identify and process emotion. That helped hugely. I am also very familiar with CBT and mindfulness which are also a massive help. 

I am continuing to explore my childhood and my emotions via open-ended counselling and finally I am starting to no longer see myself as a person who needs to be fixed, who needs to be better. Instead I am starting to see my intrinsic worth.

My difficulty now is where to go from here now that counselling is coming to the end of its usefulness. I still have a number of symptoms significantly impacting my life.

Has anyone benefited from specific treatments for CPTSD? Particularly those that help with self-soothing the parts of you that are always defensive, always on the alert?

*There does not appear to yet be a globally accepted method of diagnosis . This condition is not yet in the DSM but it is in the latest WHO classification of illnesses."
38,"It's been a few years since I was in therapy, and last time I looked into it people weren't really being diagnosed with it. I was emotionally abused my entire childhood by my father. I started having panic attacks a few months after I moved out (which are well under control now, this was 10 years ago), I'm assuming because your body doesn't have that kind of reaction while the trauma is still taking place.

Anyway, point being that I believe that the trauma is the main cause of my anxiety, depression, and hopeless feelings. And I guess I'm just curious if anyone's doctor has given them this diagnosis."
39,"Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions ('amygdala hijackings') to the frightening circumstances of childhood. They are typically experienced as intense and confusing episodes of fear and/or despair - or as sorrowful and/or enraged reactions to this fear and despair 

I am realizing I have way more emotional flashbacks than any other PTSD symptom. 

How many of you that have been diagnosed with PTSD(or cPTSD) have them? And have you found ways to deal with them?"
40,"I believe (as did my former therapist) that the majority of my mental health struggles derive from the emotional abuse from my father. While I was a shy child and therefore probably prone to anxiety, I feel that it was my mistreatment that led to the severity of my problems.

CPTSD, although widely talked about by those who have it, is not widely accepted. I don't know if I've ever gotten real treatment. But how can someone not be affected by being constantly on high alert for 20 years? I started having regular panic attacks after I moved out, this was years ago so those at least are under control. My father died a few years after I moved out, and the grieving process was difficult due to the complicated relationship. I think of him as having his own mental disorder that he never got treatment for, severe narcissism. Growing up nothing we ever did was good enough, any slight mistake warranted being screamed at by this large man. His way was the only way. I once got screamed at for asking a question about a medical procedure that I had to have at age 15, because my dad was mad that I was afraid. 

But I feel I have no sense of self. I startle easily still. I have no interest in anything really, just short term distractions. I'm still afraid of ""getting in trouble"" (for example, being too loud and making the neighbors mad), and obsessed with doing certain things the ""right way"" (such as being a perfect driver and never making a mistake at work). I just restarted a med that helped me years ago, and I'm hoping it'll start to help. But part of me thinks it's just my outlook on life, my idea of ""what's the point of any of this?"""
41,"I am 21, and was in foster all my life until I aged out at 18.
My biological parents was very absent from my life, and I only started seeing my mother more after my father passed away due to cancer last year. 
My father was an opiate addict and an alcoholic who was very violent physically, and I have been physically hurt by him many times involving one incident which resulted second degree burns all over my upper chest and shoulder.
I was sexually abused by one of my foster fathers from 7 years since I was about 8 till when I was about 15 when he died by suicide.
Thats just part of my childhood, and I went through many more emotional, physical abuse and severe neglect.
I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa when I was 15, and subsequently diagnosed with BPD when I was 18. I was very unstable when I was a teenager and the main concern was severe self harm and suicidal tendencies. However I don't really relate with a number of other BPD symptoms like fear of abandonment, unclear sense of self, emptiness and things, I do have extreme mood swings but it fits more with bipolar and I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic systems, as I experience much longer periods of mania and depression.
I struggles with flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, hopelessness and helplessness which aligns with CPTSD, and I have a very clear traumatic history and experienced long term abuse. 
Anyway professionals wouldn't scrape off borderline personality disorder from my chart even though it doesn't really feels like the right diagnosis. I have been pushing them to look at it more carefully, and actually consider my history before jumping into conclusion but no one have listened so far.
Shouldn't CPTSD be considered in my case, especially I have to say BPD is a very biased diagnosis by many mental health professionals.
I am seeing a new psychiatrist in my CMHT in a couple of weeks and I really want to express myself well, and push this forward."
42,"Hello all, I’m new here 👋

(Trigger warning)
As the subject line suggests, I have C-PTSD (complex PTSD) after being raped in 2008. 
I was sixteen and the rapist was my incredibly abusive boyfriend - we were the same age - I reported it to the police, had evidence of him bragging and laughing about it with a friend, yet they took no further action. (Apparently him outright admitting it right before denying it, isn’t enough evidence?! 🤔)
Anyway, since then, I’ve been experiencing PTSD symptoms, which actually started about a year later and at first, presented as more mild anxiety? Over time, it’s got increasingly worse, to the point I would have panic attacks whenever I went out.
He told everyone I “lied” about it and some people - even my own friends! - believed him. I was harassed and targeted for it and still am to this day.
I have become housebound with severe agoraphobia. I haven’t left my house in 8 years 😞
On top of this, I also have Aspergers. 
I’ve also been emotionally, verbally, physically abused and emotionally neglected my whole life by my parents, been bullied all my life for being ‘different’ and ‘quiet’ and ‘a boffin’ and ‘weird’ etc etc. I have been stalked and harassed by numerous bullies, too. I really wish I was making this up but sadly I’m not. Police, social services, mental health services, teachers, school support, even my own family have all let me down over the course of my life. Everyone who was supposed to protect me and everyone I cared for (ex boyfriends and even friends included), have all turned against me because of my struggles. 

Over the years, I’ve had therapists and counsellors, and of course I physically cannot go to them, so I had to have home visits.
They all gave up on me.
I have tried numerous different medications, various doses, but to no avail.
I was always very active and exercised often, took part in a lot of activities... Obviously I can do longer do those! 
Now, there are no available therapists who can come to me, and I obviously cannot go to them. I’ve checked counselling directory, asked my GP multiple times, contacted Mind who were of absolutely no help whatsoever!! I’m at the end of my tether. I feel like there is just no point to my existence anymore.
I’ve tried so hard over the years to try going out, but even still, I can’t even get around the corner of my street!
I’m on ESA because obviously I can’t leave the house to go to work!

At this point I just feel like a burden. I know what people think of me... they think I’m a “sponger” or a “waste of space”. Honestly I feel like a waste of space.
I see no way forward anymore. I feel so alone. People around me won’t let me talk about it because they don’t want to hear it. I keep being told to shut up.
I’ve lost everything and everyone, pretty much.
I am so, incredibly miserable. I can’t believe that people actually think I chose this life or that I enjoy it.
I don’t feel safe in this world. I don’t fit in. I don’t belong. I’m a worthless loser. I know that. 
I wish I wasn’t here anymore and I feel so alone...there’s no future for me...

I’m not really sure what I’m asking for to be honest. Sorry.
Just needed to get it out I suppose, since nobody in real life will let me or listen to me/believe me.
Sorry this was so long. 
Thank you for reading anyway

43,"Hello Ok so here goes..

I’ve got some behaviours (/symptoms?) which have been troubling for me and unacceptable for the folk I live with for several years (it may have been longer, but I moved around a lot so its hard to trace).. Though it affects me in ither ways its oarticularly my where I live and how I live that I’m thinking about.

Firstly I’ve been cagey around others for years but in particular, if I ‘am disturbed by’ noise when I’m trying to go to sleep I feel at least very annoyed, often resulting in me shouting through the ceiling/wall and potentially punching things a lot. Its been improving ng as I don’t feel so physically triggered (rrally tense like my whole body was on high alert) when I’m going to sleep like I used to. But I still try and block out sound and get annoyed (and often yell) if I’m woken up.. On some level it feels like I’m trying to assert myself, like I dont want to not be considered. AND i find the noises and people being near my room very annoying/ puts me on edge.

I’m not sure if this is PTSD or an ASD (my GP has suggested testing for this) response but can anyone relate? I’d really appreciate it if you could reach out!

Also I grew up in a home where swearing was normalised (mainly one parent, who was mentally unwell, at another) but everywhere else its been totally unacceptable - which I get, but I find it very hard to control, even if its too myself)
 in my room).

These behaviours have, I feel imroved, but still I’ve been asked to move out again..

I think I would like to understand this, so that I can seek a way of reconcilingwith this. Ultimately, I want to live and be accepted, probably like lots of other people need too,

Your advice would be really welcomed. Thank you for reading."
44,Does anyone here have CPTSD?  Just wondered how others cope with PTSD and CPTSD.  Thanks and take care.
45,"Ok sorry for the very long first post. This is my way of coping.   So I want to ask if you think my wife has c-ptsd and what can I do to have a happy relationship.
 
I will start off by talking about the fight we had the other day (fight still in progress)...
 
I had a small issue with my 12 year old daughter basically I was trying to get her attention but she was not in the mood. I tried to do a secret handshake with her but instead my daughter gave me her middle finger. Basically my daughter is  a young women now and I have trouble getting her to open up or communicate with me.
 
I was feeling sad over this and contemplating over the current seemingly poor relationship with my daughter.
 
This sadness was noticeable to my wife and kids. I was just very quiet and in my own world. Finally, later it in the evening, I said ""hi"" in a friendly way to my wife. Immediately she started being aggressive towards me. She said: ""are you done with your game"". Instead of being able to sympathize with me (which I longed for) it  triggered in her an emotional flashback. She immediately displayed aggression and started to personally attack me saying that I am a selfish person. Her logic is that I should hide my sad mood so that it doesn't affect the people around me. She continues her abuse by saying: ""I have no empathy and your mother never raised you right.""

This has been and ongoing theme of hers for some time now.  Recently when she gets angry she blames my upbringing and criticises my mother and says things like: ""your mother never cooked, your mother never cleaned, your mother babied me too much"" etc. This reaction from her is very much offensive to me and she knows it. What I said in return in anger is ""you don't do anything"" (she's a house wife, so I'm implying that she doesn't do much work around the house). I know that this hits a nerve and is very much a trigger for her.  The mess  really doesn't bother me as much as her  attitude towards it. She always feels the need to tell me that she does so much and is always cleaning and implying that I am not pulling my weight around the house. 

There was a time where we negotiated (with a marriage counselor) that I (on top of working full time on my own business and doing full time university) would also do the dishes (lasted a few months), cook a few times per week and then finally i switched to laundry duty (which also lasted a few months). I very much get it, that housework is not fun and is hard work.

I thought this would help our relationship but instead around that timeline she had an online affair which she repeatedly denied until I brought her proof of screen-shots of her getting naked online for a guy while talking dirty to him. Until this day she is defensive if I bring that up. She will say it was my fault, I pushed  her to do that because I was not giving her any attention. ( I had University exams and was sleeping in the guest room because my wife basically was really angry at me all the time for being absorbed in so much work).
 
Anyways back to my main point:
We ended up in a huge fight because of this. My wife is so upset at me and in her mind I am the one who started it all and I am to blame for saying that she doesn't do anything. Now it's been nearly a day and a half and we are still not on talking terms. Just a few hours ago she yelled at me saying that ""all of my (her) problems are because of you"" she claims that I'm immature and I'm not empathetic. Basically more personal attacks on my character. She  continues with saying how bad my mom is for raising me. The weird thing is that when she was saying these things I was thinking the exact same things about her.  In her rage, she almost broke my macbook.
 
Now I do suspect my wife might have C-PTSD because her and her siblings all have similar issues and hearing about how she was raised I realize that she was in fact neglected and abused emotionally. Her mum also cheated on her Dad (and there is another long story to go along with that.)
 
Anyways this message is mostly just to vent but at the same time I am looking for some sort of validation that I am not crazy.
 
 I'm stuck emotionally, I am always contemplating whether the things that she is saying about me are true. I have self doubt, fear of failure and social anxiety. Although I feel sorry for my wife I also am beginning to feel sorry for myself.  In her eyes  she said: "" all of my (her) problems are because of you""  I am more and more beginning to think that she is projecting this on me and in fact  MY emotional problems are a direct result of her treatment of me. I remember a few years ago when when I was diagnosed with a depression my wife's reaction to that was: "" you do know that depression is for selfish people."" She claims that she has more reasons to be depressed but for the sake of the kids she gets out of bed everyday and sucks it up. She tells me to suck it up and be  a real man (condescending). Luckily my depression didn't last long. I took meds for about month, didn't like the way they made me feel and that was that (although I still feel mildly depressed at times).

She hardly ever admits to be anything but perfect. But when she does it is usually to blame me that I am the one who made her like this. When in retrospect that cannot be true.
 
Over the many years of marriage there are countless amounts examples that makes me think that ""all of her problems can't be because of me"". It doesn't make sense that her problems are because of me because she had them before I even met her.  She tried to cut her wrists a month before we ever met! 
 
Another  example of when we had first met (we were dating for a couple weeks at this point): while we were together I bumped in to my (recent) ex-girlfriend at a public place and  my ex  said hi to me and smiled I said hi back and immediately my then girlfriend (and now wife) ran away in a raging anger. I had to drive next to her with my windows down with her walking because she totally was ignoring me (and not telling me what I did wrong) She was crying and eventually after about an hour of walking she was ready to talk to me. She finally told me that she never wants me to do anything like that again. Still to this day I don't really  understand what it is that I actually did but I do get that it has to do with her insecurity. They way I see it is that I was only being polite when my ex said hi,  I said hi back and nothing else happened after that. I left chasing after her my future wife! 
  
She used to repeat in anger  that I'm a narcissist,  lately her go to attack is that I'm selfish and have no empathy and that there's something wrong with me.
 
 I really believe it could be true but I'm confused. I try to think how can I change. Even when we went to a marriage counselor (couples therapy) the counselor often took her side. Only recently did we start to see a new therapist and started EMDR therapy. We have the same therapist but we do separate therapy and EMDR. The result of my therapy has shown that there were some different issues bothering me from my childhood however I was able to successfully able to recognize it, cry over it and come to a positive  conclusion.  My  therapist is happy with my progress and has said that 70% of the work is done. Now my wife has the same therapist and although our therapist is not allowed to share any specifics about her therapy but from my understanding she is not progressing as fast and still has a lot of work to do in therapy.

These days we have both stopped going because we had visitors and lot of stuff going on and couldn't make the time for it. 
 
My wife keeps rubbing it into my face and when she is angry she feels the need to tell me that I need to go back to therapy. 
 
My wife is a highly suspicious and jealous person. She is always checking my phone online, asking me who I am messaging and when I go out she makes sure she knows where I am and that every second is accounted for in my day. She always gets very jealous if I talk to another person when she is around whether it is another man or woman.  She says ""how come you don't talk to me as nicely as you talk to them."" One incident was after I had a conversation with her sister.  It really got her furious, she still brings it up to this day and she even referred to it as ""cheating."" Although we were only discussing politics and general topics (her sister did get uncomfortably close at one point to see something on my phone.)
 
Another example  of her behavior:  I went out of the house a few months back  in anger for about 30 minutes and when I came back my wife was so furious. Just yesterday she did the same thing but she left for about 6 hours. I even called her, message her and she finally responded to a message saying that she will not tell me where she is and who she is with. And to justify it she brought up the incident where I left for 30 minutes (when I left,  she had never tried to reach me while I was gone). It's very much a childish game where she tries to think of things that I have done and tried to get me back to invoke that same pain that she apparently felt. Well it is very much working as I find myself often in despair.
 
 
To summarize why I think she may have c-ptsd here are some characteristic traits  of hers to consider (symptoms):
 
My wife has emotional flashbacks
disassociating
rage
violent
 extremely jealous
 low self worth
 Can't take any form of criticism without wanting to cry
 Acts like she is perfect 
 never admits to being at fault
tendency to self harm
Identifies herself as an INFJ personality type (Myer Briggs)
 Turbulent and unstable relationships with her family and friends. (She doesn't talk to her sister and basically cut her off almost completely, she cut off her father, cut off her mother 
intentionally cut off most  of her childhood friends and all her friends for some reason or another calling them toxic
 her latest friends she praises and gets along well with however she hardly has the opportunity to spend a lot of time with them. 
At times she is very insecure about her looks and body and at other times she is overly confident in it.
 
 
So basically that can summarize me and my wife's relationship.  We have been together for 18 years and have 3 amazing kids with a 4th on the way (not planned).  We do fight in front of the kids and I think that is affecting them as well.
 
Despite everything I still do love my wife (although I understand my feelings may change if things don't get better between us). When things are low, I do often contemplate the idea of running away and never being found. We are lucky to get through a month without a major fight and a few days without a less major fight.  Some years have been worse than others, I always think that we are getting better until the next major incident.   It should also be noted that these are my view of events and I am sure her view would be much different from mine.  I also tried not to exaggerate anything but I do have that tendency.  That being said I am also to blame and I am very much childish and play the tit-for-tat game pretty well.   
 
I think if she read this she would either get very defensive and say that i twist the facts, or she would get very sad and want to self harm herself.   I do not imagine her reading it and admitting to her faults and trying to improve herself and our relationship.
 
I am looking for your opinions on who is wrong here ( me only, her only or both of us)?
Does she sound like she may have a diagnosis for c-ptsd, borderline personality, bi-polar, narcissist etc.
Do I sound like I may have mental health issues?

We own this stuff, but in essense it isnt us, but has become us....which differs to a lot of other mental health problems

i felt it had a lot of truth for me, as i spent years treating depression, treating addiction, treating lack of assertiveness etc etc and doing courses, and books......but now understanding trauma and cPTSD, has been a load off, and makes me feel at ease somewhat

If I went to explain my entire life up until now- at 27 years of age- I’d have you reading for 27 years. I’ve never really known a life without violence, sexual abuse (molestation/rape), verbal/emotional abuse and toxicity. I never experienced one year of my life without it since my earliest memories. It’s what I know. As many of us are familiar, what we grow up with- we subconsciously seek out in our environment because it feels familiar, even if we can’t realize why until the huge red flags start to show up very announced.

It’s hard not getting into the details to explain exactly how I ended up where I am. I also don’t want to trigger anyone here. But after my last abusive relationship, I had to undergo a severe emotional cleanse. Asking myself why I keep attracting such physically/emotionally/sexually abusive people had me begging God, “why me? why does this keep happening to me?” In search of this answer, my entire past came to the surface in very powerful, vivid ways. As someone who got into alcohol and other substances very young to escape my home life, I was no stranger to gravitating toward it again in a deeper way. Where I used to live, substances of all sorts are available constantly, and for low prices (we were very close to the border). I hit an all-time low. I dropped out of school, I was living out of my car for a few months. Life was so different. The facade fell.

Before that ex, I thought I was “okay”. I had a great social life. I performed music, and poetry. I hosted art & music festivals. I hosted my own open mic for a few years. Behind-the-scenes, I fell apart. Often. Always “delirious”, when I’d try to talk about how my “mind” was feeling with my friends, they looked at me sideways. I started to realize this wasn’t a shared experience. Before that last relationship, I found something on Tumblr about dissociation and PTSD. That day, I’d discovered how much I self-identified with the symptoms of DP-DR, a natural coping mechanism for PTSD. After that relationship, I’d had gotten really deep into that ‘deliriousness’, and still do.

I guess that’s why I’m posting today.

I’m in a better space now than I’ve ever been. I moved across the country a year ago, to be with my best friend of 5 years (the man who actually helped me through and getting out of my last abusive relationship). My reactions to triggers are still incredibly debilitating, but they are less frequent. I’ve been sober for a year (minus a few occasions where I drank with my boyfriend and his family, or “consumed cannabis”.) but have been 100% free of other subtances I used to heavily rely on and found in all my previous regular social environments.

I still feel anxiety on a daily basis. It varies depending on the day and how it goes. I’ve learned my baseline is just: on-edge, and that’s my “comfortable” place to be. Though my tolerance for dealing with daily life is high, once things start stacking (as they often do as an adult trying to navigate thru life) I’m so vulnerable and shut down so easily.

I’m feeling good today. This means, I’m not stressed. I always feel a strong uneasiness, but nothing in particular is causing it, or exacerbating it.

When my day goes horribly, or my boyfriend is expressing his anger in ways I am unable to process, I can’t feel my body whatsoever. It’d be a miracle, at that point, to be able to move at all. I tend to hide in very ‘claustrophobic’ type spaces and once I’m there, I’m t h e r e. It can take hours of being calmed down to try and move my legs.

But every day, regardless of how great, I feel detached from myself. A general deliriousness.
I’ve noticed drinking coffee/5-hr energies help with the symptoms of not being able to focus, but I still look around my familiar environments with a sense of “where am I? These people love me, and I know I love them too, but I feel like I have no idea who they are, or who I am.” Being in a new environment makes this feeling worse than it was for me back in my home state. Because, I don’t have many memories to back up my experience here. And as people from home contact me less and less, my feelings of detachment seem to get worse.

After 6 years of my boyfriend being my emotional support, I wasfinding myself feeling more and more guilty that he won’t open up to me because he thinks I’m already going through enough- that he shouldn’t bother me with what is going on in his head. So, for months, I stopped talking about........ until things stacked too high, and I fell apart. This was 2 weeks ago.

He was so hurt that I played off being fine. I guess he thought my anxiety was just “better”, and things were ‘normal’. But I’d put the team on my back for sooo long... being responsible for all the laundry, for grocery shopping, for cooking, for cleaning the dishes and the floors, tables, dusting, sweeping, mopping... feeding the cats, contributing the most financially,  being a full-time online student for my home state university, driving him to and from his job (which was 30-40min away each way, and bringing him lunch mid-day)... it was just too much.

I cracked.
We had another really big fight, and things are okay now.
But something doesn’t feel right.

Before I learned it wasn’t a totally universal experience for everybody, I used to find joy in it. It inspired so much of my art and music. It felt so ethereal. I could read people because while hearing their words, I’d really be analyzing their tone, their body language, their eyes. I connected with so many people in deep, meaningful ways because I could see through their walls, so to speak.

But now, it’s impacting our romantic and daily life together. I can tell he feels hopeless, and unable to “cure” me... because we’ve had conversations about this. I’ve told him- all I need is reassurance and love, and I’ll do the rest. We fought a LOT last year. A lot. It was hard to believe the long-distance best friend I could always count on to get me through tough times in my life was the same man who was berating me and punching holes in the wall. He’s come a long way.

I’ve expressed my boundaries to him and before, he would express that he feels like he’s “not allowed to be human and feel emotions,” I remind him that- of course he’s allowed to feel anger, but that- it’s his responsibility to decide how he expresses it toward me. Especially when, I just do the most to love and nurture him. His anger is for his past. I don’t take my anger out on him for my past. So I won’t tolerate being spoken to rudely, loudly or disrespectfully. That, if he couldn’t respect my boundaries 100%, then I couldn’t stay. Ever since, he’s made lots of better decisions, but we still hit a dip every now and again. It used to be a few times a week. Then, once a month. Now?

Two weeks ago was our first big fight in months. The correlation I see? I didn’t talk about my mental illness for the same amount of time.

I wish I could go to therapy. I wish I could stop feeling so detached, distant and vague. Grounding techniques don’t work for me. Sometimes the temperature trick helps when I’m in total panic, but for the most part- I have to hold my breath til I pass out, or I stare blankly into the void until I pass out. I am still very friendly, affectionate and intuitive- but he can tell when I’m feeling ‘blank’. I tend to zone out throughout the day. My boyfriend has his problems, but my anxiety keeps trying to convince me he would be happier with someone more neurotypical.

Does anyone else go through this? What works for you? Has medication ever helped (bc back home, I never found one that helped me)? Even to hear someone relate to this feeling would be incredible. I am so tired of feeling so alone in this when I know I’m not

Thank you. ♡"
53,"I have cPTSD, was diagnosed about 5 years ago, and I am not on medication.

I don't want to get too lengthy or in detail, but years ago I tried to share CSA to my mother. I was in a really bad place, suicidal, addicted to alcohol, etc. She pretty much told me I was making it up and, typical of her, she never showed me any support or care. Never brought it up or asked questions, just an immediate dismissal as though I were a liar (told me I can't just ""make stuff up""), and I again was left on my own to manage. This was a very crucial point in my life where I had courage and was broken enough to ask for help and immediately regretted it, I understood why I never said anything to anyone.

Fast forward from 5 years ago, I've since moved with my child to another state to be with a boyfriend. He and I broke up, now back together living separate. My mothers house was foreclosed upon back in my home state, and due to her poor physical health, I allowed her to stay with my kid and I until she could get her own senior living arrangement which I told her I'd help her with.  She moved here last June.  I never asked her to pay rent or anything, she offered to buy groceries as an offset which was fine. 

I felt in my heart and knew somehow that my mother was sick and unable to take care of herself.  I knew moving her here would facilitate a huge, dramatic shift in our roles, in power, etc. My mother has always been angry, mean, cold, manipulative, accusatory, abusive, stubborn, headstrong and paranoid.  She had a rough upbringing, I understand it's just who she is.  I felt tremendous guilt at the thought of leaving my mom by herself to figure out where to live, she's disabled, etc., and knew it would be difficult to live with her. At the same time I felt I was doing the right thing and had hope for a new chance at a possible relationship of some kind not only for her and I but for her and her grandchild.

So she got here last June. In November, my mother was transported from my apartment to the ER via ambulance for trouble breathing. She then was moved to ICU and was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given ""maybe 11 months to live"".  After her hospitalization and brief rehab, she's back with me to live as long as she can until we need to look at Hospice care.

Ok so, I hesitate to call anyone a narcissist because of how trendy it's become to throw it out at anyone showing self-centered, inconsiderate behavior, but my mother is definitely on that scale, the high end, if not then she is definitely suffering from a disordered personality. I've forgiven her some pretty awful behavior. I've forgiven theft, abuse, character assassination, flirting with my ex husband, and her having some sort of emotional romantic rekindling with my sexual abuser AFTER I disclosed to her what had happened, she lied about it but the truth came out really innocently and she had no ability to play it off as something else. I had no suspicion of their rekindling as they had been not on talking terms for years, but it doesn't matter now since she's dying and I don't believe they are in contact presently. If they are, I'm unaware and I don't think I care anymore given how close we are to her death. I forgive her those things.

Anyway to my point.  I had felt after she shrugged me off years ago when I told her about the CSA, that she had forgotten completely about it. Like, completely forgotten... I really thought she did because it was like that day never happened. She never once asked me about it, never showed concern for me in any way to be totally honest.  

But now that my mother has realized that her life is coming to an end before the year is up, she's been trying to start a conversation about the CSA in very indirect ways, but it's very obvious what she's doing.  I don't blame her for wanting to know, but I don't feel like it's any of her business anymore. I know how that sounds, but to me it feels like she had the time and opportunity years ago to have this discussion, to be supportive or caring to me in any way and she proved back then that she would not and could not do those things as my mother or anything else.  

I really resent her attempts to start the conversation, but I hide it very well and pretend like I don't even hear what she's getting at. Its not to be petty, I just have ZERO interest in talking about it with her ever again. To me it feels very private now, and I want to deal with it on my own as I feel she cannot be helpful and honestly it's none of her business anymore.  There's nothing I can imagine her doing or saying that will help me should I engage in conversation about it with her. She's never been very compassionate or warm, or motherly toward me.  I've felt more like the mother between us two in those ways and that I've always tried to take care of her and honor her as my mother even though she couldn't honor me as her daughter.

I've suffered a tremendous amount with the CSA, cPTSD, and dealing with my mother's own mental health/personality issues for my entire life. I feel like a very broken person. I feel exhausted from cPTSD and I avoid my mother because I'm so annoyed with her toxicity and her attempts to talk about this.  I feel guilty but I feel like I'm right about it and she can just talk to God about it herself soon enough.  Am I wrong?  How do I handle her attempts to bring this up?  I don't want to have this painful conversation with her and I feel it should be respected.  What do I do?  I don't have any friends to talk to"
54,"I am doing phone therapy at the moment because I am unable to leave my house. I have had a very rough year and can’t say how I am feeling. It’s not good. The therapist said that I have CPTSD. I was  beaten quite a bit as a child. My Mother would go into rages. I had to be careful what I said or did because I never knew what would set her off. She would come after me. It left a scar that has never gone away. 

I see that It has effected every decision in my life. Why I am so afraid and have such anxiety.

I have harmed my self twice in my life and when something happens it’s hard not to go to that place. 

This trauma has caused all kinds of     phobias. That didn’t make a lot of since until now. 

I stopped taking my medication for a year that put me in a very bad state. No one around me helped me. I’ve been sitting here unable to take care of myself, telling my husband, I couldn’t think straight, I was in pain and had depersonalization. I couldn’t see what was going on. I didn’t feel like myself and couldn’t see a future. I was gone. Not functioning. I am back taking medication but this year almost killed me. I may never be the same again... too much has happened."
55,"Is it possible to maintain a romantic relationship with CPTSD?

That's complex PTSD; trauma that took place over years at the hands of my primary care givers.

I paid rent on time this month. Usually I pay it the day before. Automatically, the thought of talking to my landlord to pay rent made me suicidal. I am not sure why I'm wired this way. I really want to move out of state.

Self-analysis leads me to believe that my fight or flight got triggered, and that's why I want to move away. I don't know why I'm so crazy.

I am so crazy. I can't remember day to day details. Things that you're expected to remember. Names. Faces. Deadlines.

I'm losing my marbles. I really don't have enough to lose.

I dunno what I want y'all to do. Pray for me, I guess.

Thank You So Much!"
56,"Hi people

i am quite confused about what type of therapy i should be doing.

So i have attachment issues, early developmental trauma and a few other trauma instances - which gives rise to the cPTSD

Now having done research i have been receiving EMDR, which i feel is helping but i am wary other people and the Bessel book (body knows the score) states Sensorimotor or other types of therapy are better.  

Really keen to not waste more time and money, so keen on opinions on treatment experiences / thoughts etc

thank you"
57,"I was abused by my teacher. I wake up most night with night mares about the abuse. I tried to get help from the school but they blamed me. I was diagnosed by private therapist . If I get official diagnose what will be the consequence on jobs. Why did she ruin my life every time I do successful stuff I contribute it to the abuse so i don’t do successful stuff anymore and have frozen. 

I am stuck in the cycle I can’t break free ."
58,"A very brief resume of what has lead to me thinking I may have complex PTSD.

My wife (now ex) developed an acute psychosis out of the blue in 2011 - her age was early 50s (I posted here at the time). She was hospitalised for a month or so. Truly awful to see her terror through it all (and I was terrified too). Unfortunately I was the focus of her paranoias. Me + conspirators. During the acute incident I was threatened with a weapon that you only see in movies (it felt like I was in one). Even more unfortunately, she refused me any communication with her health care team. It was so isolating. She was back to a functional life in months, but never seemed to get over me. The best I got was that I was no longer a threat' and if I was not `guilty' why did I not help her against `conspirators'.

The next 3 years I did my best to look after her (she never saw me as a carer). She did a few things with me, like going away for a few days, but there was little joy. Then one day she said she was leaving in 1/2 hour and that she'd instigated divorce proceedings. I've been living on my own since 2015 and a year later fell into deep depression from which I still suffer. A lot of losses over a very short period - partner , house, children (who were at the age for leaving home and have indeed left now), retirement age (it should have been).

Getting to the point, in the decade or so prior to 2011, she seemed to fall out of love with me to a position of increasing contempt, criticism, blame (always 100% my fault). It was kept away from the children all the time (she was dedicated to them - can't fault here there). We used to once enjoy having discussions about controversial topics, but it changed and all to often she'd get very angry with me. Sometimes she was raging from close up in my face. Occasionally, her anger would raise me to anger, but then she got angrier still. If ever she cried, I felt for her, and wanted to console her, but if ever I cried, she hated my tears. I used to say to my best friend that my wife has a special `madness' for me - with everyone else she seemed fine. She also said to me that everyone thinks I'm so so nice, but they don't know what I'm really like to live with. This behavior bewildered me totally. I went to a marriage guidance counsellor, and then asked my wife to come (who said it would be a waste of time - she was right about that). All this time, whenever incidents happened, I felt frozen. It was scary to be on the end of her tongue lashing. Sometimes, I tried to go to another part of the house to escape. There were some what I now see as warning symptoms of impending psychosis - there was a valuable document that she'd mislaid/lost but she was certain that I'd taken - 100% certain. My behaviour she said when I was cross-examined by her was that of a guilty person. There was no way I could prove my innocence.

And here is the spooky thing, her mum developed a psychosis at the same age, and it had a very similar pattern to my ex-wife's.

Overall, I even began to doubt my own sanity. Was I perhaps an awful person and didn't even know it? I feel so damaged by it all, and though I've been away from her for nearly 4 years, I'm suffering for it, suffering so much. I have these feelings that I should be so angry at what she's done to me, but then I know it wasn't her fault (she had a bad relationship with her mum). Everything (readings/advice) tells me this is not a healthy place to be.

Complex PTSD does seem to be a diagnosis for what I have read and I'd be interested in anyone who has knowledge an informed any opinions on this. I understand that cPTSD relates to chronic exposure to stressors and trauma."
59,"Hi everyone,
I'm new to the forum so bare with me this might be a bit of a ramble. 

So, I'm 27 and have just disclosed the childhood sexual abuse I was subjected to. I have been diagnosed with CPTSD, and I am awaiting specific treatment for that rather than the anxiety & depression treatments I had previously. I have been having so many more panic attacks that I haven't been able to get under control myself like I used to and I can barely sleep. My doctor has prescribed me Levomepromazine and advised (I presume off lisence) that I take one when I feel like I can't control a panic attack and when I can't sleep. After getting home and reading the info on them I'm concerned at A) whether he thinks I have schizophrenia B) that he's prescribed me the wrong thing and C) now I'm questioning my sanity even more than I was before and I've become a paranoid wreck!!

I wish I could just take my brain out and replace it with a fully functioning one!! 
I was right about the ramble! 😂

Thanks in advance

60,"17 Mental Health Symptoms That Stem From Complex Trauma | The Mighty

I thought this was a very helpful article, I could relate to a lot of the 'symptoms' people describe. Especially no. 2 shame, no. 13 difficulty allowing myself happiness and putting others' interests before mine to an unnecessary degree, no. 14 not trusting my own judgement, and no. 16 abandonment and trust issues."
61,"Monkey with the Thousand Yard Stare, eating a rat, encapsulates living with Chronic PTSD ~ Going through the motions, to survive"
62,"Well...my situation is complex and I could post in several of the forums on this site. 
I’ve come a long way with this disorder in the past 12 years. It never seems to be enough for other people. They only see the parts of the disorder that remain. You never hear “ wow ! You can ride in a car now ! Good job !”  You only hear “ well I don’t understand why you can’t use public transportation like everyone else ! “.  People are fun aren’t they ? Clueless unless it’s happened to them.
  So... I was in online counseling with better help. Several years.  Lots of money spent. My councelor left and I had to update my profile and look for a new one.  Upon updating I got a notice saying they would not take me, that I should be seeing an in person councelor. I said I’ve been using this site for years and it’s helped me greatly. They said a councelor had reviewed my application and denied me for the site.  But...they took me before and my issues were the same..... it didn’t matter. I got dumped. I’ve spent thousands there.  Apparently ptsd and panic disorders are more than they can handle even though their councilors claim they can on the website. 
I told them I can’t see an in person councelor because I can’t drive or walk and the nearest is 10 miles away. “ oh you qualify for med transport”. Well...that is part of my issue....I can’t get into a vehicle with people I don’t know. Not to mention I’m terminal and my immune system is insanely low. It would be very risky even if I weren’t phobic of riding with strangers. 
  So yah. I got dumped by my counseling site online at a very stressful and bad time. I felt very betrayed. Used. My trust of people regressed. I used to self harm and hadn’t done it for years since I had online counciling. I didn’t know what to do. So that started again. Once.  They set me back years.  I was angry...now I’ve just settled into a realization that this is my life.  Apparently I’m too messed up for even shrinks to deal with. I’m a joke of a human being. That is not being said to garner affirmations, it’s simply the truth by what current society dictates I need to be. 
  I am in kidney failure. I don’t have much longer to deal with this. But still 3 to 5 years I suspect depending on what my body decides to do.  Really I guess the complex ptsd/panic now revolves around stability.  Being dependent on others which mortifies me. Having a roof over my head.  Not knowing what some person in my life may do next that will effect me adversely.  The helplessness of it all.  My only hope right now is to buy a used rv to assure myself a place to live. So... lots of stress. It’s a game against the clock and the wildcards ( people ). 
  Right now... I’m scared to death I have said something wrong and my post will be removed or I’ll get banned.  If that is the case...please at least be humane enough to tell me why."
63,"I read these couple of articles about Complex PTSD and found them helpful. I especially liked the first one from The Mighty, it explains clearly how anxiety and depression in c-PTSD are different from anxiety and depression in other circumstances. The second one talks about how c-PTSD is being better understood all the time and will hopefully be included in the DSM and the ICD before long (the diagnostic handbooks used by mental health professionals).

When Complex Trauma Is Misdiagnosed as Anxiety | The Mighty

What Is Complex PTSD? There Isn’t Nearly Enough Awareness Around This Illness"
64,"Has anyone recovered from their experience of cPTSD enough to feel you can cope reasonably enough day to day?
I'm at the end of things now. I tried to get through on my own for years (and too ashamed to speak what had gone on), have tried to work with professionals to get help. Very limited help, am in worse position now than ever. Repeatedly told that people either won't or can't help due to risk. Which is no help whatsoever. 
Where to go from here I don't know other than the obvious.
Thanks."
65,"My life could have been very different if my Secondary School had addressed my bullying but instead they blamed it on me.

Judith Herman pioneered the establishment of Complex PTSD to be included in the DSM and people with PTSD are highly vulnerable to Alcohol and Hallucinogen abuse which is what I did.

If the very worst comes to the worst and I really don't want to do this but I am thinking of suing the school for neglect and defamation of character.

But that's the very last resort.

Don't suffer bullying at school in silence and if the school authorities blame you for the bullying your suffering for fuck sake move school.

I so wish I did."
66,"I am not sure where to start. Ok, I went to see a new therapist. I told her my all my issues that my social anxiety and trembling has reached a new pinnacle, to where I refused a perfectly good job offer and, now, find it hard to go to public places. I try to make myself go out and face my fears. . . . About seven years ago, I was told I had major depressive disorder, after I had attempted suicide several times and tried to harm myself. I was put on anti-depressants/anxiety medication, including mood stabilizers. Nothing worked, it felt like I was taking vitamins. Anyway, long story short I went and saw this new therapist. She told me what it sounded like was complex PTSD. I grew up in a chaotic home with an explosive father whose rage left the house furniture in shambles, maybe a black eye, and tons of psychological terror around. Basically, I grew up in survival mode trying to dodge flying pieces of furniture. My mother was a codependent who enable his behavior and several times blamed it on me. 
I don't want sit here and blame my parents for my problems now as an adult. I want to want heal from all the crap I have experienced. I would like to talk and connect with people without expecting the worse or becoming so afraid I can't utter a word. 
.... I am 29 years old and don't want to do anything with my life. I am a student and working on a degree, but I don't really want it. I am just doing it to do something. So, I am not completely lazy. This must sound so awful, but I am being honest."
67,"diagnosed with BPD but told may have CPTSD. a few years down line i am struggling a bit

hi I was diagnosed many years ago with borderline Personality disorder and went through some DBT 3 years ago. for most part it has been successful. I am still having a lot of anxiety around people from my past (emotional verbal and occasional physical abuse in childhood, teens and into adulthood from a close family member). I am mostly stable now but do have these bizarre attacks of anxiety which either cause panic attack with physical symptoms or turn into extreme rage (looks like a toddler tantrum but I am 34!) I have been violent and confrontational in past when I get these attacks and there is a history of self harm in various different forms. 

I am no longer under secondary mental health service but with an IAPT (Improving Access to Therapy/LIFT) -referred therapist in  my area (South West UK) and my GP. I was discharged by psychiatrist earlier in the year. I am no longer on mood stabilisers but do take fluoxetine for anxiety, binge eating and OCD which are issues for me right now. Fluoxetine helps me a little but with Christmas coming up and family stuff triggering me I feel I need more help? my therapist tends to invalidate my feelings- I have been with her since June but she says because my therapy is short term she doesn't want to get deeply involved with my trauma history. She DOES acknowledge the trauma is there, and has been very helpful when I was getting nowhere with Binge ED getting me to go to Overeaters Anonymous, but she has a tendency to put down my feelings regarding anxiety and identity issues.  It isn't that she is nasty but I feel uncomfortable with her in some ways. She pooh poohs the idea that I need reassurance that I can trust her and other people. paranoia has been a huge issue for me and social anxiety too, and when I get into crisis in between week long sessions I feel unable to talk to her.  

I had an episode last week where I ended up in A and E department over anxiety and the mental health team is writing to my GP insisting I need a med review. it has taken me a couple months of trying to get GP to see me. the practice is oversubscribed and out of hours have just told me I need to speak to her (my usual GP) about medication. My usual GP is a lovely lady, but because she is good and understands MH so many people go to her.  But the paranoia tells me maybe she has got fed up with me always asking for things. last time I had to ask for help from GP surgery I had nasty meltdown and I just feel that maybe they fed up with me. 

I have a support worker with a charity in my area- she tried to refer me to courses fro help with anxiety organised by a local Wellbeing College. sadly because I see a therapist I am not allowed to attend courses or get peer support as WC is under the NHS primary services. 

I feel abandoned (which was what triggered my crisis the other week) and that they think I'm a waste of space."
68,So in 2015 I was raped. The perpetrator is in prision after going to trial where the Jury found him guilty but Im finding it really hard to move on because my point is I'm just going to be about healed at the time he will be let out.
0,"I've only ever shared this once before in a therapeutic setting that I thought was safe, and was met with so much shock and judgement that I never opened my mouth about it again.Hoewever, I still feel the need to get it out, explore what it could mean, and hopefully find out more about it. I can't imagine that i'm the only one who has them. There have to be more people out there, but there's so much taboo on the subject, that nobody really talks about it. I hope to find some people who can relate, and explore what it's function/symbolism/meaning might be.Disclaimer beforehand: These are thoughts that I would NEVER act on, and that I don't take literally in any way. They are no reflection of who I am, or what I do. They are just thoughts.Ok, so here goes. Trigger warning, mentions aggression towards children.Ever since I was young (I have memories of this going back to..I don't know..seven?), if I hear a child cry or whine in a certain way, it triggers instant aggressive thoughts in my head.I feel this intense rush of anger, and I see myself lashing out, hitting the child, sometimes just completely beating them up. I can't really descibe the trigger exactly, it's a very specific type of cry and it makes me wonder if it represents something that happened to me, that I just don't remember. But it could be more broad, obviously. Repressed anger over injustice that was done to me, that I then project onto someone else. I don't know. Either way, I feel really ashamed and horrible for having these thoughts, and i'm terrified that if people knew, they would think that I'm a bad person who can't be trusted with children. Which is absolutely not the case. Like I said, i'd never do it, or want to do it. They are thoughts, and many people have vengeful or aggressive thoughts/fantasies that they would never consider acting on.Anyway...i'm really curious if there's anyone else out there who has this, it would be somewhat comforting to know that i'm not alone. And i'm really curious if you guys have theories as to what it could mean, where it could come from, or what function it has. Thoughts?"
1,"Hi Alter-eg0! I don't have too much to say, other than I think intrusive thoughts are quite common in CPTSD. Also common to some degree for most people I think. I also experience quite scary and terrible thoughts, especially when I'm already triggered in some way. I don't feel ready to share what they are about though... Just wanted to tell you you are not alone, and I agree that they are just thoughts.Sorry you only recieved judgement the first time you opened up about it. "
2,"CPTSD  can start from infancy onward. What I found out about myself was because my mother neglected me and when I did complain or whine or speak up I got a quick, stern, ""Stop it!"" As a child that is devastating, especially because I was already in shut down (freeze-mode). So when I heard a child whine or whatever, I got angry. It's my mother! Her attitude towards me becomes my inner attitude towards the child, which is really my attitude toward my Inner Child. When I trace my feelings back to what happened to me as a child, that's when I begin to understand why I am like I am.I hope this made sense and was helpful."
3,"I do a lot of thinking of this sort, wondering about thoughts -- so perhaps that helps explain why this response ended up longer than I'd probably like. As humans we seem to have endless possibilities, fed by thousands of thoughts that can resemble a roaring waterfall pouring all sorts of information into our brains. Some stick there, while others move downstream and onto something else.It's too much, really; and where they all come from, some expected but mostly not, is hard to figure. Somehow we also have a capacity or wherewithal to at least partially decide what we notice, what we discard or hang onto, or put in our 'either/or' basket. Sometimes we're not really sure, or mature enough, to decide what seems to truly belong and/or what we want to keep. Unfortunately, our development can be rather dependent on outside thoughts, especially those originating from those people around us when very young. And -- too often, at least with regard to c-ptsd -- the thoughts can dreadfully mess things up.If we suffer from enough abuse and/or trauma, we're thrust into confusion, contradiction, and panic over what's going on. It's very easy to internalize it and start blaming ourselves, not knowing any better.Meanwhile more thoughts continue pouring down the waterfall. Hopefully we'll learn how to discern enough to not be so affected by too many negative vibes. Boy, is that easily said, but so hard to wriggle free of. It starts being contradictory to what life seemed to be. It leaves us in a fragile state of anxiety and self-doubt.Okay, so that's my drift. My point is simply that our thoughts come and go, often from sources we have no clue about. The most prone to stick, unfortunately can also be very troubling when we can finally try to figure it out. Bottom line -- the never-ending deluge of thoughts is very much a normal part of what humanity is supposed to be about. Yes, we have lots of aggressive or contradictory thoughts in the human package. Many of these thoughts can't be stopped or easily controlled. Judging them as wrong or bad isn't so much the problem. Picking out the ones that don't seem attuned to our authentic self is challenging, and tiring; especially considering the innocence in which we develop.In lieu of full control, all we can do is hope for better discernment, built on our own inner sense of self; problematic as it needs time to grow and develop in order to withstand abusive outside influence. Some thoughts aren't really ""our own"", but were thrust upon us by others. Hope you made it this far -- in summary, thoughts aren't always random, but can derive from many sources. And it's okay to not be okay about certain thoughts, too. Maybe there's a reason for them, but scoping them out can feel like like trying to find the needle in the haystack. As for the ones that obviously don't fit who we are, we have the choice to honour our own values as to whether they truly reflect who we are. Sometimes, they really are just thoughts."
4,"Woodsgnome.. Thank you so much for that! It's very obvious you have been reflecting a lot on this issue, and I very much agree. I think as survivors we are very vulnerable to be stuck in that roaring waterfall of thoughts, ideas and information in general. We haven't been taught how to regulate, which affects much more than ""just"" feelings. We have not been taught how to discern our thoughts in a healthy way.Like you wrote, I also think it is the cause of a lot of our confusion, contradiction and sense of panic.You are very good with words, Woodsgnome. I love when I get new ways to look upon something, and new perspectives. "
5,"I'm not sure if it would help, but if you ever manage to find an example of what the cry sounds like, I've known several women in my life who could identify what a baby was upset about by the type of cry. Once we were in public and there was a small baby doing short, impatient sounding cries and the woman I was with pointed out how it sounded and told me the baby was hungry. Another time a woman made an exasperated comment about how a nearby baby was tired and should be taken home, saw my confusion, and explained that the cries were long but not wailing: a tired cry. Apparently long and wailing or high pitched bloody murder cries are ""I'm hurt or something unfair happened, pay attention to me"".Idk if that information would be useful to you? If it were me, I think I would find some peace in knowing what kind of cry it was so I could remember that the baby is hungry or tired and feel some empathy and softness for them and by extension feel some empathy and softness for my past self. Or maybe you might find that knowing the baby is hungry inspires some kind of panic in you? That could be helpful to explore. Why would a hungry baby cause someone panic? Or maybe it's a tired cry- why would a tired baby not be able to fall asleep, and instead be crying? Why would a ""pay attention to me"" cry go unanswered? My suggestion is that if you've ever seen a high school drama, the girls who are the meanest are also the ones who have the harshest standards for themselves. For me, and this will sound awful but I'm sure you understand, it's cancer patients. I never talk about it because it sounds so bad. I had really severe life-threatening health problems growing up, and no support. I couldn't really talk about it because of my family, there was very little empathy. When I see ""recovery parties"", or the outpouring of support for cancer patients, something inside me twists like a burning knife. I hate it, I don't want those feelings but they're there. Maybe if you weren't allowed to cry from a young age, there could be something in you that burns when someone else gets to? Not because you're awful but because you're still hurt. It's a kind of suffering. "
6,"That's a really interesting question, goblinchild. I hadn't even thought of that yet. And yeah, I absolutely get what you're saying. Makes a lot of sense. "
7,"What you have described sounds a lot to me like misophonia. I have it, and there are certain trigger sounds that send me into instant agitation and (unexpressed) rage. In my case, baby crying is annoying, but not an actual misophonic trigger—but I have other ones that do qualify. Basically, the second I start to hear the sound, something inside me completely and utterly wigs out. Usually, I try to get away ASAP, but that’s not always possible, given circumstances. When I can’t get away, I’m basically shot and useless until the sound stops. I won’t be able to have a conversation or even think. It’s a terrible experience. I’ve actually started avoiding certain activities that may end up exposing me to my triggers—it’s that bad. There’s a documentary about it called Quiet, Please. It does a good job of explaining what life is like living with this. It has really wrecked some ppl’s lives.Not trying to diagnose you, but it’s something that may be worth looking into"
8,"They walked around and looked into all of my windows first like a creep. They were talking to my neighbors and I didn't know?? They showed up when they knew I was injured and having an adverse reaction to the meds for the injury, impacting my judgement and ability to take care of myself. They know they're not welcome here. Ugh. Like, I don't need to go on about it. I'm sure all of your creep-o-meters are going off as badly as mine.  It's just that they were so squirrely. In the past I was so conditioned to feel like I was just being crazy when I noticed these things, but I haven't seen this in a year since I went low contact. The way they were speaking was strange for them, they sounded so weirdly desperate. Not groveling desperate, but ""I'm desperate, it's unbearable, so I'm here to forward my wants over your needs and safety"" That sort of thing. That ""I'm going to use you to make myself feel better whether you like it or not"" thing. It's been a while since I've been on the other end of that and I'm a little shaken and dissociated tbh. I have more of an inner compass now, and in my gut I feel like maybe I need to affirm my innate value and humanity to myself and assure myself that I'm not here to be used by any * who prefers to hurt people instead of help themselves. It's hard to push away the humanity of it all though. They've told me before to my face that they prefer treating people this way and have no intention to stop, and that they understand they have a problem but they just don't feel bad about it and don't want to change. They get offended at me when I suggest they need to fix it, as if I'm an unaccepting monster. It's so easy to get sucked into those memories. I hope I can use these feelings of anger and lack of safety to double down and care for myself even more. Protect and value myself even more. "
9,"I am too far gone. Cannot play games. People expect me to be normal and then when they find out I'm not - have a grand time making me feel worse. I hardly ever interact anymore but when I do, I am in dissociative mode. I just can't deal anymore. Are there any vlogs by anyone who is thriving with this? Any success stories?"
10,Read Pete Walker. An author who has CPTSD and helps others through it. Get support. ACA may help: Adult Children of Alcoholics and other dysfunctional families.
11,"I'm sorry you're feeling so bad atm, EdenJoy. Could you be in an EF? That could make you feel ""too far gone"". As for success stories, you could try our Successes/Progress board:  https://cptsd.org/forum/index.php?board=51.0 My impression is there are quite a few partial success stories here on the board among the mbrs, myself included. Things aren't easy, but they are way, way, way better than they used to be. Also as marti wrote Pete Walker who wrote ""Surviving to Thriving"" and is really doing it! You can read some of the book here for free: http://www.pete-walker.com/ "
12,"Sorry you're struggling Eden, Complex PTSD can be so overwhelming as many of us here know.   I just wanted to suggest that you fit in here because we get what it feels like and try to help each other recover. One important piece in that effort is trying to understand and accept it's our experience of abuse/neglect that was/is abnormal, not us. Our responses to that abnormality means we have had to develop responses (e.g., freeze, fight, flee, fawn), to help us survive and that's all, we ourselves aren't weak or defective.  Besides Pete Walker's book I'd recommend ""It's Not You, It's What Happened to You"" by Christine Courtois."
13,"Is this common? I think it probably is.Walking my dog this morning, as I always do, people do stop, in fact, someone had wound down their car window specifically to speak to me about their dog, and then I carried on walking with another dog walker, who was on their way to meet someone else, with a dog. As it turns out they were meeting someone I know, a mum, whose daughter was in the same primary school class as mine, our daughters had been friends then. Off they went, together. I went on my normal walk, sometimes I see people and walk with them, or stop and chat sometimes I don’t, nothing is pre-arranged as their walk was. No one makes ‘dates’ with me, I don’t suppose I make dates with them either, it seems difficult, I fear rejection. I feel I should be grateful for the people who do want to speak to me, however, briefly. There was one man I used to walk with quite a lot, he even called at our house to show my daughter his new puppy when she was ill. He seems to have changed his walking habits over lock down. However, there is a pattern with my normal walking acquaintances, they are generally male and 70+G"
14,"Walking the dog is such a good way to get some interaction. I'm awful at making and keeping friends and inclined not to do so because it overwhelms me, plus it's a struggle to be 'switched on' and fun enough to encourage people to want to be friendly with me. I'm OK with it and have never felt a need for many friends. When I have had friends I've always coped so much better with just one or two special people rather than juggling a large group. For this reason, when walking it can be really nice to see people and to have a pleasant chat with no expectation of having to make it a regular thing or commit to a friendship. I think it works well because as you say, a lot of people do seem to want to say hi and stop to talk. It does seem to fill a small gap if you're feeling lonely. "
15,"It's hard to see other people making their way in the world, whether with marriage, or friends, or groups, or in their chosen career, when I feel unworthy. But who inflicted that on me? My family system, my parents' inability to love and nurture me when I was totally dependent on them - from infancy through all the developmental stages. At each one I needed them and they weren't there. I was expected to already know, to be ""responsible"", to just do it without guidance. It's very sad and I've grieved a lot over what I lost, no, what I never had. A difficult road with lots of   and   and   and   AND   Yes a LOT of anger. Sigh."
16,"Wasn't sure where to post this tbh - sorry! So as like many people no doubt here, I am consistently hesitant to trust; partners, family or friends.I've been with my OH for 8 years nearly, love him dearly, most of the time. But as I'm discovering more about my CPTSD, and how i react, I'm starting to resent him. I don't know why exactly.And an old friend popped up during Lockdown which was totally unexpected; having stopped talking a few years before because we conflicted has made me have some super strange feelings.This old friend - I have never met him - we met on a teenchat room when I was like 15 (dangerous I know) and he was 14, and we have been speaking on and off for the last 14 years... He has always said that he has forever been in love with me (unbelievable to me), and still he knows he will likely never meet me. I am from UK and he lives in Canada - pretty far away!He and my OH are aware of each other, and I'd like to continue with my OH completely. But lately with being hyper emotional to everything, dropping friends like potatoes etc, I am finding myself OBSESSED with my old friend. But i don't want to be. Its like a totally new emotion that I can't control.I'd like to continue as I was but rekindling with a friend not like a crush - and drop this teenage obsession before i buy a diary to hide under my pillow.Has anyone else experienced this?"
17,"Today is the anniversary of my Fathers death.Feeling nothing. Like someone has taken everything, all feelings. Not in a numbing way, in a completely empty way. Hollow.Well that's it really, I just wanted to tell someone. To get it out, to see if it would make any difference. I don't think it has tho.Ah well, time to clear up the days mess."
18,"OceanStar, I hear you. Whatever you feel, or don't feel, is okay."
19,"Hi,I have been told by a couple of people that they walk on eggshells around me and that I take things personally. I can’t see it but I guess it must be true, so I need to work on this. Has anyone got any experiences on how to be less reactive, please? Thank you 😊 "
20,"The way I currently understand it, the reactivity that follows taking something personally stems from a sense of threat. One reacts in defense to threat. The thing one is defending is one’s ego/sense of “self” (felt as being separate from the rest of the world, to a sort of “pathological” degree, I suppose). Apparently, there are ways to tame the influence of ego, such as (non-dual) meditation or controlled use of certain types psychedelics that reduce activity in certain areas of the brain that enforce that sense of separateness "
21,"Hey dewachen, one way I learned to turn down the volume on my reactivity was I took an online CBT course.  I'm not a fan of CBT as a cure all for CPTSD, but what it did for me was help me learn to slow down and question my reactions before I acted on them. When we were being abused we needed to react quickly so we could respond to the trauma we were experiencing & flee, fight, freeze or fawn to help keep us safe.  These reactions become almost automatic so we have to learn to  see/feel what we are doing, slow down and assess whether there is any real danger and interrupt that automatic response.  This is the course I did  - https://www.learntolive.com/  - but there are quite a few out there now from what I can see. Hope this helps  "
22,"There is a women in my recovery programme who I've known for 5 years..I became more friends with her and stayed at her house few times ..I now don't speak with her on recovery calls or interact with her due to her condescending ,superior and iron fist attitude. I used to take it on calls cause she used to say helpful recovery stuff but the way it was delivered id get in a bad mood and in the end wasn't worth it .She openly says she has bpd and in some ways I think I've denied that as she has good eating disorder recovery. Over time I've just hated her more and now I cant stand her .This morning she was on the zoom meeting and get what she is the secretary surprise surprise .someone else was leading the meeting and there was an issue with sound .I spoke to the host and said I don't think the leader is on the line ...with that said person said ' Yes she is on the line ' in a sort a authoritative slightly aggressive way ....My anger went off like a rocket (internally)  and I was close to saying something of which I didn't and am glad I didn't...I wanted to say why do u talk to people like they are idiots !I'm now wondering if she is a narc she seems to fit the bill ...really inflated sense of self importance yet I know from her that she has crushing low self worth..I'm not saying i don't have some personality issues to work on and my goodness i can be condesending and ego at times too..I want to work on this anger I have towards her and be able to let it go ...its only eating me up..she is a sick person and I don't need to interact ..I have thought about not going to that meeting but it is one of the UK meetings and I need to be there to help newcomers ..My lesson from today is to not offer any comments about the meeting ,just do my share and be quiet ...I need to not focus on this women and expect her do what she does and know it's nothing to do with me ...It helps me to reflect on my own behaviour and when I'm being self righteous ego etc how that must be for other people ...glad I can see it a bit more in myself and can work with it ...Any thoughts /experiences on the behaviour i describe about her ...the condescending ,superior ,iron fist type ...Any ways to think abouT it deal with it ?"
23,"I read this book... (yes, here I go again talking about books! Sometimes I irritate myself) and anyway it helped me a lot with this same, idk what to call it, defensiveness I guess. Not that it still doesn't affect me, but it's easier to deal with if I remember that another person's words and actions are due to their damage, outlook, opinions, etc and don't really have anything to do with me at their core. Anyway the book title is ""The Four Agreements"", it's kind of new age-y and I didn't buy into that part, but overall it was really helpful. "
24,Hi three rosesThank u for your response That is just on parr with how I have been looking at it this past week. It is from her damage and has NOTHING to do with me...I have that book! And had actually put it in the charity bag so I'm gonna dig it out and re check it out with regard to this person... Thank u dear and I hope this finds u well 
25,"I want to hide. To be left alone to be me on my own without anyone else watching me, seeing me, knowing me. No noise, no expectations, no time boundaries, nothing.I am in an EF and I want to feel my way through, to begin to actually understand. I realise that pushing my experiences away doesn't help but right now I have no idea how to feel my way through this and be with others. Anyone any ideas. "
26,"Its a good first step to realize you are in an EF.  If you can spend some time and figure out what triggered it, and to process what you are / are not feeling and thinking that should be a big help. I think being with others comes after we are in a better place with ourselves.I know it can be really tough, but I'm sure you will make it through in time. Wishing you all the best!"
27,"I've found that I need space, a lot of it to figure out what I am feeling and why when I am going through an EF.  I used to feel guilty or whatever for needing to but I came to see it as necessary, much like a diabetic needs insulin or someone with a broken leg needs to rest and elevate. It makes sense that we need to feel safe during an EF because we are more vulnerable, but also to turn down the volume on additional stresses (people, sound, light, etc) so we have the energy to deal with it.  So FWIW I say hide away if you can and if/when you're up to it post here and/or talk to someone you trust to help process what triggered the EF.  "
28,"There are times I need to hide also. I feel safest on the floor covered with a blanket. I can't hide as much as I feel the need because of responsibilities, but when able I let give myself the space and care. "
29,"Thank you all. Your messages ment a lot when I was in a dark place.I am feeling better than I was. I know I'm not there now and I'm grown up but there is still quite a strong pull back. Does anyone else experience that pull back? It's like being sucked back into the past hopelessness.I don't think I'll make much sense of anything now, I'm tired. "
30,"That sense of being pulled back is definitely common OceanStar.  Pete Walker refers to them as emotional flashbacks when we 'regress' to a younger self and the feelings we had then.  There's also a saying among trauma survivors that captures this:  ""I'm not stuck in the past, the past is stuck in me."" We have a lot of unprocessed trauma that is not integrated into our self, it's stuck if you will and that's where we go back to under stress/are triggered.  So perfectly normal for us and it really does take a lot out of you so hope you will take time to rest and let the effects subside.  I used to feel like I was hungover and in fact found out I was in a sense from all the chemicals/hormones released into my body.  Along with reducing stress and getting more rest, I would drink a lot of water to help flush them out.Hope this helps.   "
31,"Is my ability to bond with people permanently damaged because of trauma? Am I always going to be alone? I really wonder. I've always been more or less isolated because of social anxiety and avoidance interfering with my ability to socialize. I tend to be needy and overshare in some contexts, because of craving intimacy, too, even if it's kind of contradictory with being avoidant. I've been trying to improve on my social skills for years, and telling myself it's worth it to keep trying to connect with people, even though it's hard, and it hurts when it doesn't work, and it feels like it's something that's permanently not for me sometimes. I'm 26 and I still barely have any friends. I'm scared that as I get older, my ability to meet and connect with people is really not going to improve at all, because who's ever going to appreciate and respect someone like me -- with trouble holding a job and not much hobbies or excitement about anything because of depression? I don't think I'm alone because I'm hurtful. I take a lot of pride in not replicating the toxic behavior I was surrounded in through my family, like being manipulative or making hurtful jokes and things like that, but my way to relate to people is still not quite right. Like, I have a few friends but I feel like all my relations are asymmetrical, like others matter more to me than I do to them, always, and it scares me. I don't know if I'm unable to appreciate the proximity in the friendships I do have, or I'm genuinely a side character in the life of everyone who matters to me, it's hard to tell. I feel like I'm one step removed from being abandoned by everyone who matters to me, pretty much all the time.I'm not in contact with my biological family. I feel like I haven't really had a family at all; any kind of parent figure to really show me safe and caring love, and give me guidance and reassurance. I wish I could have someone like that in my life. I really want a chosen family. I wish there was some kind of dating website analogue for that; messed up person looking for parent figure or sibling-like friend, anyone interested? But there isn't.Can someone reassure me that it's not just me with these issues? That it can get better, that people like us get to bond with people and love and feel loved, too? That isolation and abandonment are things we can escape if we keep trying and believing it's worth it to reach out?"
32,"Hey Periwinkle,I can assure you that you are not alone in having these issues and feelings. I’ve been having trouble coming to terms that I’ve been more or less abandoned by my family, especially during a time I needed them most. This feeling of abandonment has left me especially vulnerable to abandonment issues. Not too long ago, I did something to violate my wife’s trust. She is really the only person I can rely on now. She openly discussed leaving, not knowing where the relationship would go and divorce. This pushed me to a really dark place.I don’t know if I can offer you much advice right now as I am still very much in the depths of trying to resolve my abandonment issues. But again I can tell you that YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  "
33,"@buddy9832 Thank you for the support! I'm sorry you're struggling with similar issues and I wish you good luck, working through things with your wife and also, importantly, with yourself."
34,"I can relate to a lot of what you wrote, periwinkle. I have wondered the same things. I think with our kinds of wounds it's really hard to form close connections with others, for fear of being hurt in the same ways again. It's really hard. For myself, I really struggled for decades with barely having any friends. I recently realized that there has been a part of me that has resisted and doesn't want people in my life. It was a bit of shocking insight, to be honest! It took me a really long time to figure out, but for me, I think I need to do more work on myself before I'll be able to successfully start to build up connections with others and hopefully form close friendships. I used to think it was the other way around - if only I could make friends somehow, then I would be able to heal and be okay. But, I think once I have healed enough, I will have enough internal resources to put towards working on letting more people into my life. It's going to take some time and effort, because I am ambivalent about people - on my good days when I feel okay, I love to spend time by myself, I'm a big introvert. On my bad days I am desperate for someone to be there for me - that's not a good basis to try and start a friendship or relationship with other people on. So, I need to get to a place where I have mostly good days, and then I have to actively work on the part of me that, truth be told, can't be bothered to go out and socialize.I've come a long way with the help of therapy, it certainly has made me more relaxed around other people than I used to be. I do show more of myself and am less invisible, but I still tend to hide myself around others.It isn't just you with these issues. I think the social isolation is part and parcel of relational trauma. I also know it can get better, as I can see my path forward in this area now, which I didn't used to be able to. One thing that is making a huge difference for me, is the IFS therapy I am doing. I only just started that, and it's a game changer for me. It is absolutely worth it to keep at this.  "
35,"@owl25 Thanks for sharing all this! It helps to know other people struggle with this too, toxic shame tends to make it feel like every issue is uniquely my own & my fault but when stepping back & with some reassurance, it becomes clear that they aren't. Good luck with therapy & great to hear you have been able to notice some progress!(I was really in distress when I started this thread but I'm back to feeling stable fwiw.)"
36,"Glad you're doing better now  If the same distress pops up again, coming back to this thread may help. All of what you are feeling is totally normal given your past experiences. You're not alone with this.  "
37,"Relationships are hard.. When they are working they are amazing when there is struggle I just run..I'm fearful of speaking up.. Being able to do this in a considerate and kind way.. Then I go understand drown in resentment, anger, venom and am left choking.. All thoughts welcome "
38,"Just waking up here, so I'm not able to respond coherently but wanted you to know you've been heard.  "
39,Thanks three roses appreciate that.. 
40,"NOTE: I type too much, motor fingers if you will. I get going and it just pours out. I have so much to say and try to keep it short but this is what happens. Sorry for the length, I tried to keep it short..I have to start somewhere and after reading a new member introduction today which really hit home, I decided to start with this.A very long time ago, from when I was very young and into my early grade school years, my feelings were stolen from me. Oh, I had them and when they were expressed, they were in one way or another destroyed or co-mingled to the point that I think the only one I was left with was anger, which when felt was usually not expressed toward or appropriate to the situation at hand. Ended up being contained anger never released. I think the last time I had feelings was around 4th grade when I was betrayed by a pastor and had a promise made to me by my parents broken.  Soon after that, I remember lying on my bed, crying, saying to myself that I will never allow myself to be happy again because happiness would always leads to disappointment, rejection, emotional pain and anger. And, I have only cried twice that I can remember since then. Throw a tantrum back then? Sure, why not. No one would listen to my side of the event and I didnt know how to do anything else. Tantrums did not make things better and since I was being both seen and heard, a big no-no in a dysfunctional family, it made it worse. I did not exist to my parents as a real person, I was not allowed to have feelings, I was taught to do what others wanted of me regardless of what I wanted for myself, my feelings were meaningless, my parents emotionally absent never supporting me and what I may have wanted my life to be. They never asked or listened so how would they know. And as for my feelings, I was not allowed to have them so they got buried and all mixed together in one big ball of anger. I guess thats why Ive been sarcastic and critical of others my whole life. Its what I ended up getting or taking away from my young, formative years. Detached, co-mingled and totally suppressed feelings.And, before I go on, I have to say that I have a very good memory of my life. I remember playing with a farm/ranch toy with animals and fences on the floor of my parents home before I could walk. I remember toilet training. And I remember 3 huge, significant events in my early life, events that I truly believe were the beginning of my cPTSD, emotional and mentally abusive events that took place when I was about 3 years old. There were many others bad things that happened to me in that time period of 2 to 5 but the big 3 impacted me forever, as I now know, and I can still picture the 3 scenes as if I was standing behind myself watching events happen, detached from my body seeing myself as one of the participants, chronicling the traumatic events for later use, for reference as I tried to make life better starting in the 80s, to make sense of what I was, who I was, why I wasnt worth anything, why I was a square peg in a round hole, why I could never do anything right, why I had no friends, why I could not get close to anyone and why I would not let anyone get close to me. And then came my 3 month spontaneous apocalypse, the big reveal showing me what had happened, that allowed me to put 6 decades of bad memories into perspective, to understand everything but also with the realization that the traumatic scars last forever, and recovery is not a fast, easy road.  And the memories I have? None of them are good, happy times. Only remember the bad stuff done to me and faux pas I did to others. I now try to fall asleep at night looking for my mind palace of good times. I have but two, one is not a happy ending and the other was a temporary event with no one else around, both happened during my high school years.So, with that background said, back to this topic, whats love? The one feeling that I have never had, never experienced is love. I dont have the foggiest idea of what love is.  I do not feel love, I do not know love. I did not realize others loved me in the past but know they walked out of my life after a period of a few months to a few years because I did not, could not return the feeling of love they had for me, some loving me 10-20 years after walking away. I was not, could not look for love because I did not know what love is. I regret that I lost a lot of good people in my life who loved me because I did not see it, feel it or return it. If love hit me square between the eyes today, I would not know it, feel it, be able to receive it, appreciate it, share it or return it because as many have written on this site, I was taught that I wasnt worth anything and I guess love is the really big anything that went missing from my life. I was, as could be said, that person looking for love in all the wrong places. As a fawn, I did what I thought others needed or wanted me to do be accepted by them. I did everything for them, never for myself because I didnt have a clue of what it meant to be a person, I was not myself, I was not living my own life, a life stolen at a very early age. And the relationships I did end up having were shallow and short lived because I only sought the feeling of their acceptance after doing something I thought they wanted me to do. Thats really a sad commentary. Another regret I has is how my life could and should have been so much better had it not been stolen.So, whats love and how do I find that feeling? What do or can I do to find that basic feeling and kick start it back to life in my head, my heart?  I must say that for several months after my spontaneous reveal, I truly understood, not felt but understood, what love really is and why one of my biggest regrets is never having had love in my life. Then there are the many regrets of the many opportunities missed because I did not know love. With that came the deep desire to go back and apologize to all those I hurt for not knowing, not understanding love, for not knowing they loved me and I basically rejected their feelings. Those regrets hit me in my heart, not my head, and for the first time in my life probably gave me an experience of true love lost, the sorrow and the deep regrets for those things that were stolen from me, my life, and making me realize how my life could have been so much different, better, full, filled with love had it not been for my early emotional traumatic experiences that started it all.I cant buy true love, I know that. But is there a way to develop, to learn a feeling I never had? Or do I spend the rest of my live without it? I'm at a loss on this."
41,"Regret, Huge questions. Right now I just want to let you know that I read your post. I know it can be vulnerable to write on the website, so want you to know you are being heard."
42,"Thanks for the reply. I realize many of my questions will or can not be answered. Most of what I write is historical, what happened to me over 60 years and asking where to go from here.I started to write about my spontaneous reveal 2 years ago today and had to stop less than half way through it because what I was writing began to drudge up gut feelings that made me nauseous. I guess I do have feelings that  may come bubbling up going forward and who knows where that will take me.I am numb to feeling almost everything, anything, except anger and frustration. All other feelings I may have had have been repressed for so long I don't know them.  And by having been all internalized for so long, they must be all mixed up so when they surface, i won't know how to deal with them. But, on the plus side, it seems I do have them somewhere since writing about it now stirred up something that didn't feel good.I will work on my reveal over time and when ready, post it somewhere else on the site, in its own topic, and it will be a long, historical post."
43,"What is love?I never had it either, at least nothing I experienced externally resembled what I sensed it might be like -- my FOO seems to have hidden it well out of sight. But that was then, and then has been left in the dust. Which doesn't answer the question, does it?So I found this song a couple of years ago that didn't have any step 1,2,3 answers either ... but it perhaps better describes the seeking for love as developing from an  inside process. Along the lines of no one can provide love if I don't already have it within. And there's the song's suggestion that once you remember who you are, the seed within a bright and shining star, you're closer to love than you realize. Love? Within? Now? Despite ... all the pain?Having grown up without examples of much that resembled any love message, I somehow still know it when I see it. And it hurts knowing it wasn't part of my life, but it can be now, even if it's still experienced somewhat vicariously. But I found this song, didn't I? And it spoke a message, a vibe that resonates. so let's call that love, for now. The song's title -- The Wandering Soul -- speaks to the endless roaming about reaching for love, then finding that ... oh, I guess it was right here all along.This singer had lots of probs with relational love, according to those who knew him. Despite this, according to his first wife, his stellar quality was as a romantic/idealist and in her words: ""the world is hard on its romantics.""Enough. Here's a link to the song:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGCi9Jzs1Fw"
44,"woodsgnome,Thank you for that reply, another door opens for me asking a question. Walking through that door was not what I expected. The past few days have not been good for me. Yes, like you, I grew up in a loveless FOO with parents spending more time fighting with each other than taking care of the metal states of their kids. My younger sister suffers more than I right now from those early traumatic years. That has been left in the dust but those darn regrets constantly remind me of what was stolen from me, very good hindsight is maybe not the best thing to have in recovery.It has been said that to love others you have to love yourself and that is something I have never been able to do. I dont know what love is, what it feels like, how to express it. I have feelings related to love but they only come up vicariously watching a special moment on TV or in movie. Love has not been in my life since age 3 or 4, when my life was stolen. I never heard The Wandering Soul before you posted the link and with my old ears, had to look up the lyrics which really hit home for me. He wrote There's a danger in forever looking outside, you start to believe that all your prayers have been denied, and you forget the sound of your own name, and thus begins the suffering and the pain.  That sounds like the birth of a cPTSD Fawn, or Please, typology. Without love, I was taught at an early age through traumatic events to looking outside, to please others and no live my own life. Near the end of the song, he wrote Suddenly the mystery is clear, that love is only letting go of fear but is it that easy? Or is it really an epiphany moment as he writes? About a year and a half ago, cPTSD became known to me, very clear to me and for a period of about 9 months my head was clear and I felt everything, had no fear or anger, had great empathy and compassion for others. I had a dream in which I met myself when I was 3 years old, my happy loving self. After that dream I woke up and was truly myself 24/7. The parental tapes disappeared forever, and have not returned in my current state of distress. That empty mind lasted until about 9 months when a series of not very nice events in my life destroyed that new way I had of seeing life, the rest of my life. Oh, I still had the regrets from decades of past actions that were really not mine, they were the actions of the Fawn, but I had compassion for myself for each of them and that feeling is now gone, again. Without love for myself, the regrets I have are worse than fear. Everything I do, see or hear reminds me of some event in my life over the past 60 years that is deeply embarrassing to me, for having done it, and it makes me sad seeing what I lost, what I never had, how it could have been so much better if I had not been living my life as a Fawn trying to please everyone else. My life was truly meaningless living with parental tapes in my head keeping me a child in line continuing their control over me. All I have are regrets, so many heart breaking regrets, and no happiness, or love, or close friends to counter them. What I see now, everywhere, is indeed the vanity of my vanities was vanity. All of my life was lived with one vanity or another controlling me, I was never myself and with that way of living, how could I every find unconditional love, learn to love, know love, give love?I am not in a good state of mind right now and it is affecting me physically. Ive been writing this off and on for 3 days trying to get it right and done. I have a knot in my stomach, nausea, lost my appetite and find it hard to breath. Its been this way for a few days now caused by events I am well aware of. This enhances the sadness and sorrow I feel now knowing my past actions were not mine, that my life was stolen from me and that I could never know love, true unconditional love which hurts me under the current event stuff.I wish I could cry but I havent in over 30 years. Repressed that a long time ago. And my dreams which have always been pleasant escapes from waking life are taking on a dark tone that I do not like. After reading those lyrics, dealing with life events and trying to work on recovery, something is changing. Ive been deeply heartbroken, disappointed, sad and mad these past few days. Love is still lost for me. I can deal with the current events but those 4 feelings arent improving, probably wont until the issues are dealt with and some time passes. So thank you for the insightful reply and the link to that song, which I listen to often and once and a while a few words do affect me for a bit in a positive way. The search continues . . .   unfortunately with distractions."
45,"Dear Regret, it sounds like you are having a really, really tough time right now and I'm sorry. I really hope you can feel better than what you're feeling right now. Are you seeing a therapist? It sounds like that could help you. Please be kind to yourself. Here is a link to some self-compassion exercises, just in case this is something that helps:https://self-compassion.org/category/exercises/It is interesting to read about your sudden reveal, and the mental state you were in for some time, before shifting to where you are now, without the internalised script but also without the euphoria - perhaps that's not the right word? - that you felt. I read about a very similar situation in Jasmin Lee Cori's Healing from Trauma: A Survivor's Guide, which is mentioned in the resources page on this site. I'm looking at the table of contents now and I think it's in Chapter 10 - Spirituality, where it has a section called ""The Transcendence Trap"". As I remember, it describes a woman who had a similar experience to yours - she had an awakening, feeling her bad conditioning disappearing overnight, and felt only compassion and connection with those around her. After a few years, she lost that feeling and felt like she'd been thrown out of paradise. I think it was because if you haven't actually processed the trauma, it can still be buried under the surface? She was then able to process the trauma and get back some of that connected feeling, but it was a richer, more integrated whole experience, with the light and the dark combined. This is just what I can remember, so please take a look if it sounds helpful! It's a helpful book in any case.This is just my opinion, but I'm not entirely convinced by the idea that you can't know love until you love yourself. After all, that's how we are supposed to learn to love as babies - we are loved, and so we love. It's very natural and starts before we even have a concept of self. However, I do believe it is true that you can only feel as loved as you allow yourself to, but I think you can learn step by step. My partner loves me and that has been changing my life for the past nine years, ever since we got together. I would not have figured out that my family is abusive if I hadn't experienced what real love is from him. Sometimes, he gives me compliments and I just feel unable to accept them and deflect them. It's a good barometer for how my self-esteem is doing!As a fawn, the real test of love will be when you are able to say no, to have an argument, or to make a mistake, and to know in your heart that although it's not comfortable or pleasant for the two of you, whether you are friends or lovers, it's not going to end the relationship. It takes time to build relationship like that, which is perfect for you. You can grow as the relationship grows. Please try not to fall into the trap of all-or-nothing thinking - just because you don't know love now, or don't have a loving relationship now, doesn't mean you can't someday. You don't have to figure it all out in one go. You said that you felt in your heart that you wanted to apologise to the people you lost. I wonder if this is the next step for you? Who knows, maybe you can recover some relationships. Or maybe you can't, but you can give some closure to some kind people and learn something in the process that will help you in journey. Obviously only do what is right for you, but I think if your heart is telling you something, it must be worth listening to, even if taking action is not the right thing. You must feel some love in order to feel so sorry, so it sounds like a healthy sort of pain. I am sorry that you are feeling so much pain, though.Sending you hugs and I hope you feel better about yourself."
46,"OSCEN,Thank you for your insights. Ive been trying to write a reply for more than a week but each time I come back to it, Ive changed, things have changed, so I ended up revising it over and over. After a week of revisions and suffering the pain of stirred up memories, I finally got this to a short form reply.My big 3 temporary, situational events are over and I have recovered 90% from the bad emotional and physical state I was in. I am no longer frozen in place by those events and I find my thinking about everything else changing by the minute. I am once again able to sleep and my constructive dreams are coming back with the same two scenarios, builds and people, but different in content from what they had been.Right now, Im unsure of the next steps I need to take but I seem to be getting away from the need to tell everyone every detail of my life, a complex, leftover trait of the fawn typology, I think. Its a one day at a time process for me right now so I am moving, acting slowly based on being in the moment and going forward.I am painfully aware of what happened to me, when very young, why it happened and each day I end up feeling differently about that and myself. I started this topic by asking whats love and, yes, we are not born with that feeling. It has to be given to us, instilled by loving parents. Each day more becomes clear and while my parents provided everything I needed physically, I was not given anything to help me develop emotionally and after 5 or 6 years, I was conditioned to be seen and not heard, to do whatever to make other like me and any feeling I got along the way was verbally beaten into submission. I was and have been emotionally numb for over 60 years. I dont love, hate, fear or feel happiness. In bad times, I get angry, feel anxiety which physically turns me into a wreck, and generally know the reason, the cause, but thats it. And, I am sad most of the time.So, not only do I have many regrets about living my entire life with cPTSD, but also have to live with disappointment (the opportunities I recognize as missed), disgust (over my past actions or words spoken) and defeat (Im mentally exhausted). I lost my life, who I could have been, what I could have done, to cPTSD and its really too late to do anything but grow up  I think Im about 5 or 6 now, I was 3 when I began this recovery process.Yes, you were right woodsgnome, a child is not born with love so must receive it from loving parents in their early years. There was no love in my FOO. My parents were so involved with their interpersonal issues and verbal fighting that there was neither time for me nor love for me. They were not equipped, not able to raise an emotionally healthy child. And, when I was 4, my parents had another child which gets into abandonment issues for me. My mother had a rough childhood and as I knew her, thinking about it now and had narcissistic tendencies. My father came home from WW-II with PTSD. I was born into a marriage that should never have happened. I dont know if they ever loved me or were even capable of loving me.Oh, Im human and there are times in a some TV show episodes, some I remember well, or movies during which tears well up vicariously for a few minutes and then its back to un-normal numb. I really think those vicarious feelings are the result of my seeing, in a scripted performance, that which I never had but have been innately looking for, needed and deep down felt was missing from my life. That doesnt happen often but each time it does, its always the same scenario that tears me up. Even being emotionally numb to everything, it seems my damaged inner child can still miss what it doesnt have, never had. Other than vicarious tears, I havent cried about anything in over 40 years and there have been many events that would have warranted a good cry. I dont get into verbal or physical fights with people. I catch flies and release them outside, feel bad over the death of a pet but I cant cry at a funeral.So, whats love? I wont ever know because I am living with, have to deal with the effects of cPTSD. I also understand the failure to develop into a well adjusted, balanced human being is to this day preventing me from getting close to anyone, for a whole host of reasons including the lack of all feelings and learned traits of a fawn, taught to please. I dont know how to let anyone into my world, Im afraid to let anyone into my world for fear of being hurt, and until I can and do, love is locked out of my life. I can feel love when I see it vicariously, but I am not wired to be it, to have it, to have it come from within. I can see it in others but am unable to have it in my life, my stolen life, my numbed out life. All my life Ive been a human doing getting others to like me, not a human being living my own true life, the life that was stolen at an early age. Sad, isnt it?As for my thoughts of going back and apologizing to people,  it would be to those people I liked back then, to apologize for the way I was back then, strange or weird. I can still picture the expressions on their faces when saying or doing something strange but I didnt know why. It wouldnt have been to anyone I lost since I never had anyone in my life to lose. I knew a lot of people and all of them must have looked at me as strange for the way I acted and what I said.  I was always the square peg in a round hole person and I seemed to know it, felt it. I did not make any friends so had no friends to lose in my entire life. After discovering I had cPTSD, then realizing who I was and what I was like back then, I felt a need to contact those who are still alive to apologize to them, explain to those I really liked, for being strange, being a jerk and telling them I really didnt know any better back then and why. To tell them that I really liked them and am now deeply disappointed that we did not become lifelong friends. But, over the past few weeks, my thinking on apologizing and explaining has changed. I now realize the desire to apologize was being fed by my fawn typology, doing something to make others like me now after all these years. There is no going back, there is no need or reason to apologize to anyone, whats done is done, and no need to explain my life to them. Those desires apparently coming out of my fawn typology are weakening and will hopefully fade away.I was raised by my mother (my father was always distant) to think we, our family, was better than anyone and everyone else, to critically look down at them, when in fact, we were the odd ball family in the town. I would really like to know what my high school class mates and their parents thought and said about my FOO but that will never happen. Knowing that would be a validation of what I think happened while I was growing up a cPTSD fawn.  I was raised, trained to be seen and not heard and to do whatever it took to get others to like me regardless of what I wanted or felt so I didnt question my mothers statement about others, just accepted them as true.Its really quite sad to realize that after my parents stopped their intense, verbal fighting, when I was about 10 or 12, they discovered they had a child who they did not know how to love and were not getting love from the child. They only knew how to provide food, shelter and gifts in hopes of getting their child to love them. It didnt work. Love from a child raised to be emotionally numb and devoid of love cannot be bought. Knowing what I do now about cPTSD and my life makes that an even more sad commentary on their lives, as well as my own. They also must have been quite torn and tormented within their own lives. I am the product of their lives and its sad to now know how my life was stolen.So, whats love will be an unanswered question for me. The big question is how deeply do I want to dig into my past. Do I really want to stir up emotions and feelings without having a solid basis on which to handle, judge or deal with them? Being numb is nice in one way, ignorance is bliss, but being on that island is lonely life."
47,"Hi Regret, this sounds very hard and I'm sorry you are going through this. It sounds like very painful grief for the life and the you that could have been. My thoughts go out to you. I believe you can come through this. You sound strong and insightful and humble. Sending hugs to you, if you want them. Please keep sharing your story."
48,"Oscen,Thanks for the reply.Please remember that I have no feelings, just thoughts and memories. That's where the regrets come in.  Never happy and sometimes upset. Went to a meeting today where the speaker unexpectedly talked about family life, how to raise children well. After the meeting, I thanked him for telling me everything I didn't get when young and the 60 years of pain it cost me. I think I caught him off guard and after mentally trying to quickly process that comment, said, ""be sure to go forward"" which is good advice and what I am trying to do these days, going forward. Since my revelation of all after my big reveal dream, which I have to write about in its own topic, the new understanding combined with my memories created the regrets. The regrets are a heavy weight on me all of the time. But they are my guide to going forward, painful as they are. I don't understand this state having regrets but being numb to their pain. Probably the best for me. I don't think I could handle the pain of my regrets from my memories all at once. My sister, 4 years younger, also has cPTSD and is in a real mess right now. She stopped communicating with me about 4 months ago. I worry about her.  I'll see her in early June. Her perspective of our FOO is from the view of the freeze typology. But she understood what was happening back then when I was emotionally dead, still am, and that greatly affected her. She being younger watched, experienced what I was going through and that affected her.However, I do enjoy the sparks of euphoria that hit me once or twice a day out of the blue which are very joyful and happy and related to some memory of a life experience, but not experienced that way back then. Does that make sense? It's almost as if I was getting the good feeling I should have had back then in the moment instead of playing the fawn. I wish I was in a group to talk about and get feedback from all that I am going through. Might find one. I had those euphoric moments a lot before the big 3 events but the big 3 shut them down. Now they are slowly coming back but infrequently. My dreams are getting better, more positive and enjoyable. No longer dark as they were during the big 3 events. I think if I had feelings, the big 3 would have given me a nervous breakdown. Was close as it was but I think the lack of feelings actually helped get me through that period the best I could.I'm lost all alone on an island devoid of emotion. Writing that brings up anxiety for some reason but it will pass in a few minutes. After my big reveal dream, i was a totally different person from who I was before that dream for about 9 months. Then the big 3 stole that from me. The 3 are over and now I am trying to get back to how I was after that dream, before the big 3. I really want to get there again.Thanks again for the reply. You are helping me think through this in a different way and it is helping."
49,"Was reading posts by others in other boards and while I realize I dont have all the terms down which makes it harder for me to find words to quickly describe something, I did discover others who suffered emotional abuse when young are also devoid of feelings, emotionally shut down, numb. I also realize that my lack of feelings means I have no trigger words, nothing said bothers me and, as such, I dont know which words I use could affect others. Im sorry if anything I write triggers bad feelings in others."
50,"Hi Regret. Glad you found a place to share... it makes it better, really.My adult onset cPTSD robbed me of my emotions. I didn't even realise it until I was recently hospitalized. Psych evaluation diagnosed me with Schizoid Personality Disorder: emotionally aloof, unavailable. I watched myself having an argument with my partner last night and I didn't feel a thing. I didn't even get angry enough to defend myself.I kept thinking to myself: I should be feeling something right now. But, I wasn't. I simply didn't feel anything. I'm not even sure yet what to do about it.Be safe...LTLTR"
51,"LTLTR,Thanks for that, very interesting. My cPTSD started when I was about 3, emotional abuse with abandonment on the side.I woke up to cPTSD about 2 years ago now, realizing then my life was stolen. Prior to that, in anyone got mad at me, said I did something wrong, didn't believe what I was saying or if I just thought I did something wrong, it would set me off for weeks, thinking about what I did wrong and worrying about that and any ramifications of my perceive bad actions or words. As a fawn, I tried to get people to like me anyway that came up. One way was to tell someone about something I knew, such as earth plate movement, and if told I was wrong, I would get upset, try harder to get them to believe and be upset about their calling me a liar for years (the plate tectonic situation really happened in the late 70s and it bugs me to this day that I was not believed - or they may have know I was right and were just playing me, I don't know but it hurt. Anything that upset my word resulted in anxiety, worry, anger and trying to make it better - a sad place to be for 6 decades. After my big reveal, discovering I had cPTSD and where it came from, I no longer have those buttons to push but I am still devoid of most emotions and feelings. Case in point, one of the big 3 events dealt with a landlord who on 3 occasions within one month ripped me for about a half hour to the point that other people in the building heard the noise and looked out to see what was happening. What they saw was me resting on the passenger side open window while the almost had a heart attack in what I believe was a self feeding BPD crude attack on me. Post cPTSD reveal date I just stood there, looking at him with no expression on my face, no increase in heart rate or BP and thinking as he talked about what was he doing. I had no anxiety or worry after each event. The 4th and last time he did that to me was on March 17th when we were ending our lease agreement at his house. He accused me of not doing something, which I did and told him I did (and I have 11 people who would sign an affidavit saying I did it) but he accused me of cheating him, lying to him, dishonoring him and went off on a half hour tirade. His wife called down to him to calm down and he yelled back ""No!""  Once again, I just sat there with no expression on my face, no increase in heart rate or BP and thinking as he talked about what was he doing. After about 15 minutes, I got my files together, stood up and started to walk out, which calmed him down for about 10 minutes before relaunching his crude, abusive tirade on me. After I left, I again had no anxiety, worry and did not feel bad - but driving away called him a few things I wouldn't repeat in public, which he deserved.My point in all that was prior to learning about cPTSD, my life was a daily wreck trying to please others and listening the the parental tapes in my head inventing criticism of myself to feel bad. Post learning, nothing sets me off. But, I am devoid of emotion, which was good in dealing with that jerk, but so very limiting in my trying to recover and lead a somewhat happy life. Nothing triggers the bad place I was in before understanding what happened to me, what stole my life. I realize I am fortunate but I am still emotionally dead, except for anger and anxiety.I had another one of those short euphoric moments today. Was watching a show on TV and the driver rolled down his car window. Seeing that, I got this instantaneous feeling of being in my car in the early 60s, rolling down a window and even smelling what that old car smelled like and I felt a wave of happiness, of being back in that moment but with good feelings about it, but only for a few second before back to current time. That's usually how they occur. Something sets off an old memory for a few seconds but filled with enjoyment and happiness, which did not exist back then. The mind is a strange device and having all my memories of life, all bad by the way, I do get these go backs which are quite pleasurable for the few seconds they last.I'm sure I'm not alone in having that happen. I'm not good at putting it into words so I hope the above made sense. This happen to anyone else? The one ""go-back"" I never have is to one containing love, places only, never people or love.I have to write my big reveal story, will try to work on it more but it's hard to write so it's really slow going."
52,"QuoteI got this instantaneous feeling of being in my car in the early 60s, rolling down a window and even smelling what that old car smelled like and I felt a wave of happiness, of being back in that moment but with good feelings about it, but only for a few second before back to current time.This has been happening to me now also, for a few years. A pleasant emotional flashback! "
53,"Saw a T for an initial consult yesterday. Told him my life stolen life story from 4 years prior to my birth to the present day.This T is quite experienced in PTSD and cPTSD. The big decision I have to make is to begin therapy with him or let it be, live the rest of my life in my current state of mind. My question to him was if it would be worth it to dig into my past to resolve and recover from that which was mentally beaten out of me in my first 10 years or so of life and reinforced for 20 years after that so by the time I hit 30, I could beat up myself for everything, real and invented in my fawn persona. I became emotionally dead as a way to not feel the pain incurred in my early life so I asked him what would be the point, would it be worth it to me to get in touch with my emotions and feel, relive my pain from long ago events. He said it was my decision.He found my dreams interesting and helped me understand a few significant ones but was speechless about my big reveal dream about 2 years ago. He recognized my big 3 current events as something that set me back, triggered me out of a good place after my reveal, but did not take away all that was given to me in the reveal, did not take me back to the way I was up to 3 years ago.My thoughts are to see him to get me from where I am now back to where I was after my big reveal, the dream in which I talked to my 3 year old self (about the time my FOO emotional trauma began) and from the next day on was a changed person for the better. To have him help me get rid of the trauma residue encountered or received during my big 3 recent events, all of which are now over and I have almost recovered physically from the mental mess, pain, anger, anxiety and worry suffered during those big 3 events. I would really like to get back to the person I was before August of 2018. I can live with a loveless life, without love in my life. I am a good, caring, compassionate and non-violent person and those traits are, have been sufficient for me to be a good person in a life devoid of love. The fawn is dead, the emotions are dead, still not a happy person and don't enjoy anything but I became free from my cPTSD after that dream and I really like the person I was until last August. I would be satisfied to get back to that which could be done without digging into whatever happened to me, all that pain I repressed in my early life.I am willing to just forget about the 6 decades of my life stolen from me when young and just settle for the life I was really enjoying, really felt comfortable in, was a real person for the first time in my life until the big 3 triggered me and stole that new life away from me, left new residue to be dealt with.  Any thoughts on this tentative plan of action?"
54,"Wow. What a powerful story. I felt as though I was reading my own biography. I do not know what ""love"" is, but I have learned that people show love differently. I, myself, cannot understand or comprehend the definition, but I have defined my own love for my family as doing everything I can for them. Is it right, I don't know. But I needed to try and identify with what ""love"" is and that is all I could come up with. My T recommended the book, ""The 5 Love Languages."" I have not read it yet but am hoping my husband and I can read it together.Best of luck."
55,"Does anyone know of any retreats for trauma survivors (esp. CPTSD) that aren’t the super-fancy, exotic-location, heavily staffed, super-expensive sort, but rather something more low-key and humble? I’ve been searching online for possibilities, but all that come up seem to be pricey, rehab-style getaways with all kinds of cush perks that I don’t really want and wouldn’t care to pay for I ask because I haven’t yet gotten up the guts to form my own, local FTF support group (very embarrassed to admit), and I crave the opportunity to meet and share with others who are on my same path, IRL. I don’t have anyone in my life who truly seems to be able to relate to what I’m experiencing (my partner cares, but can’t relate, 1st-hand). It occurred to me that maybe there’s some kind of informal retreat out there (I’m not even requesting that it be near me)I briefly thought, “Hmm, maybe, if I were somehow magically really ambitious,  I could try to organize one myself (for certain reasons, that scares me less than the idea of organizing some kind of regularly meeting local support group), but I figured there could be liability issues when a bunch of strangers are meeting for the 1st time, and I’m not good at sticking my neck out, nor would I want to task myself with vetting people or whatever else might be necessary. I don’t have the energy. And I’m too much of a catastrophizer....Anyway, I miss having contact with others through support groups, and am still exploring what might be done about it. Any thoughts welcomed(I just realized that conferences could be a possibility, too...)"
56,Have you thought about trying some group therapy Saylor? It might give you more opportunity to connect with other survivors in a safe space and perhaps carry that over into a relationship or two outside of the group? 
57,"Another idea I just had is starting a video conferencing support group given there are free apps like Skype available nowadays.  It circumvents having to set up a meetup location, liability, safety, etc.  It could be with people from the area you live in. That way it would be local so you could meet people and possibly develop some friendships where you feel comfortable enough to meet up for lunch outside regular meetings.  If you keep it anonymous it would maintain a level of safety until you are ready to reveal your real name (or not). Just noodling here but it might be a good way of meeting other survivors in a more connected way, but without all the work and risk. "
58,"Thank you, Kizzie. Those are good ideas. I’m in now a small town for the first time in several decades, and there are many good things about that kind of lifestyle for me, but one bad thing is fewer opportunities to connect in person.I’ll see if there’s anything local in terms of group therapy (my pref would be for more interaction among sufferers and less therapist involvement—I’m still kind of reeling from my last therapy experience—but not sure what the options are). I’m not sure how best to get a Skype community started (maybe by starting a blog?), but I will research that angle, too. It seems that that could be a safe way to try to jump start things, and would be a good compromise among all the factors at play for me. I’m envisioning it would involve setting up time slots for folks to jump on and join in when available and interested. Something to explore, anyway. (If anyone knows about something along those lines that already exists, please let me know.)Thank you, again!  "
59,"I'm thinking about starting a VC group here because the F2F CPTSD meeting I went to (the only one in my area unfortunately) did not go well, and was wondering how to get people interested too.  I found the F2F group via MeetUp (https://www.meetup.com/), which is for F2F meetings but could be used for setting up a virtual meeting too I think.  I like the idea of doing it in my area because it gives me some time to get to know members and then if there are some I'd like to meet up with F2F I can do so.One app I use for setting up meetings is Doodle (https://doodle.com/) - good way to find out the best time for people to meet once you get some interested people. "
60,"Saylor, if you do start a video conferencing group, for all locations, I’d like to join.  I wouldn’t know where to begin sharing my story in other group settings. I’d just recently decided to spread around. Group support for my codependent behaviors and my su spouse, here for more private and trauma related things, friends for day to day stuff, and so on.   I’m soured on therapy too.  My last 2 therapists have behaved unethically.  I’m now looking for a spiritual advisor, of sorts, interested in nature.  "
61,"Since all of the Covid stuff, I am very familiar with online ZOOM meetings- they are easy to set up and attend!Btw, I really need a support group too!"
62,"This might sound like such an odd question, but I feel muddled over the past few days, trying to understand who other people are in my life to me and in context to my healing and journey of recovery. My therapist said to me last week that I may need to grieve for the loss of a parent that I didnt have, as well as a childhood I didnt have (Maybe that is why Ive felt so incredibly rubbish all week) and with this has come a sense of disorientation in my understanding of the people around me. For instance, if I grieve the loss of parent in my life then who, or what, is a partner - if not a rescuer, or a fixer or a parent? Being blurred on this before now might explain why I have had problems in long term relationships, when I start to trigger and everything becomes incredibly convoluted and unclear between me and a partner. Maybe I am seeking a parent? Therefore unresolved grief gets worked out via the partner, which suddenly seems so unfair on them and also impossible. And friends. I have sought a level of nurture at times that could also be me seeking parenting, and I am aware that people have at times stopped messaging back, probably because the need is overwhelming. I do feel embarrassed to admit that, although, I can understand why I would have done this and I feel compassion for myself as someone throughout life looking for a family and parenting.However, in accepting the lack of parent, it means there is so much room for new types of relationships, and possibly protecting my relationships from that pressured dynamic and narrative resolution role play...Id be really interested to hear other peoples views on what they see as a healthy relationship with a partner, a friend and maybe even a therapist. And does anyone else have experience of this kind of mental shift, in regards to how grieving having a parent can redefine relationships? "
63,"Also, is it at all healthy to seek parenting in any form in others? "
64,"What you've observed and described so well here, Sasha, speaks volumes about why this condition bears the 'complex' tag as its first word. It's messy, rides the subconscious, and seems to have a life of its own. Meanwhile, we tend to resist grieving what we never had, and it's natural to reach for it elsewhere. Of course this can lead to even more brokenness. Then we get stuck there, and that too can fade into the dark background. How to get out becomes even more elusive.Personally, this has characterized my relationships as well. I've also reacted in a number of ways, from radical lifestyle changes to changing my name, but not until recently have I understood much of what took place. And worse, the hidden need to grieve (and/or fear of it) has just messed it all up again, and it's just so hard to feel entirely free of the need. Very disconcerting, leading to more hopelessness about ever finding daylight ahead. After all, it (daylight) was never there in the first place.One thing I've continually tried to adjust is to ... gulp ... grieve yes, but also to form a new person out of the wreckage. I've been doing this for a number of years -- for instance the name change, which in large measure symbolized the break with the psyche I needed to grow away from. Still a work in progress, but it very much makes me resonate with your dilemma. It's natural, though -- why wouldn't it be? It can, in a roundabout way, lead to either seeking new ways of being (on one's better days).Okay, that's probably enough from my perspective. I just felt very drawn to what you have to say, as it's so eerily familiar; disturbing but also sadly reinforcing that need for grieving your therapist has pointed to.Best of everything as you continue sorting this out.  "
65,"What came to my mind: What is the difference between getting support from friends and seeking parenting? When a friend responds with understanding and kindness, is that parenting or just being a good friend? In a parent/child relationship, the parent is the caretaker, nurturer, forgiver, etc. The child is (rightly) needy and the receiver. In a friendship, the relationship is more give and take, although there are times when one person is giving more and the other is receiving more. I know this is not a direct answer to your questions, but relationships are complex. When you add woundedness to mix, it becomes even more complicated."
66,"It's hard to form healthy relationships if we suffer from relational trauma and haven't learned what one is.     And as you suggest, how do we form and sustain relationships if we haven't recovered enough and may ask for too much?  Adult relationships are generally reciprocal, balanced (although there will be periods when need is more one-sided of course). If our needs outweigh those of the other person in an ongoing way then it doesn't bode well for building a healthy relationship.   I don't know if seeing a T is enough for most of us because it is a therapeutic relationship. Group therapy seems to be a good option though because there are others like us who get what we're going through and are on an equal footing with us. Safe, caring, holistic therapy F2F communities would be even better   I'm thinking of places such as Body and Soul in the UK. If we deal with the wounds and gaping holes our trauma has left with us in environments like B&S. then we don't carry that into our relationships with partners, children, friends, employers, etc., at least not to the same degree.  It gives us more of a fighting chance to build and sustain healthier relationships imo.   "
67,"Ive wondered about this type of stuff, too, SashaIve often felt that, since I was barely parented as a child, Ive been carrying this decades-long craving for parenting around with me, and sometimes I just want someone (a friend?, a partner?) to voluntarily step in and do the job. Interestingly, my sibling had at some point, unsolicited, told me the same thing... so we both arrived at this realization independently. I think it could be a somewhat natural response for our kind of folk (and it seems somewhat along the lines of the oft-mentioned symptom, repeated search for a rescuer). I have to admit, I sort of wince when I think about it. It brings me a bit of shame, like Im needy or even lazy. Yet, there it is... Sometimes I wonder if I am, in fact, actually relying on another adult (usually my partner) in some ways, as though I were still a child. When I feel that suspicion, I get paranoid, wondering if its obvious to others At any rate, if you subscribe to the theory that we, or at least some of our parts, have been frozen in time (childhood) in response to trauma (and I feel this is true for me), then there really cant be shame in feeling this way. Its a normal response to an abnormal situation. I think Ive settled on a belief for myself that, as long as Im aware of it and maintain an awareness of the other person and their needs/wellbeing, then I shouldnt beat myself up over my yearnings. I have a small number of ppl I feel close to and care deeply about. I try to take care of them, too, and in the end, I think thats what matters"

I am very glad I met my therapist and that she positioned this to me. Sad as it is to grieve for lost parenting, I feel focusing on this the other new perspective I am gaining from therapy, I feel like I'm having a breakthrough. It is leading to new instances where I am able to handle triggers better. As well as possibly helping me deal with the desire to be 'rescued' it's also helping my see that when I am triggered I can yearn for external parenting instead of pulling upon my adult self as a valuable and consistent loving a reassuring resource.

Your comment opened my eyes to the fact that in my romantic relationships I have (unconsciously) partly strived for a parent/child setup in order to try to feel secure. These needs have been misplaced, as the pain of parenting lost in childhood is projected onto a partner as a need that is sadly futile. It cannot be fulfilled to that degree, especially when the consciousness is not present to examine how heavily this need may weigh on a romantic relationship or friendship. It possibly even perpetuates the trauma, as the need is never fulflled. It is misplaced. This sense of identifying the 'location' or timeline of my emotions is something I feel tangibly since I wrote this post and started to grieve more. Your post also made me think about the nature of the partnership my adult self desires, and that is one of mutual and equal give and take, therefore not the parent/child dynamic. It has been very helpful for me to realise adult self wants something more progressive for me and my partner.

Something I am working on is trying not to judge my child needs as harshly, catching myself when I respond with disgust or shame. The other day my partner and I had a misunderstanding about planned time together, and I went from 100 to 0 in a split second, triggered into abandonement depression. The sham said, so loudly ""Of course I got it wrong. Why the * would anyone want to hang out with us.""... and flashback commenced, with visual and emotional memories of neglect coming through.How on earth can I carry on telling this poor child that they deserved this, and that this is normal? I don't want to do that any more. I want to do everything in my power to smash the critic that turns that awful trauma back in on my self, and abuses my wounded child AGAIN. I want to put a stop to it. To treat my yearnings as parts of our selves that need to be heard feels much more compassionate than my previous mode. I have always been able to see it clearly with a partner, and my parent head has been strong and active for others (co-dependent, anyone?) but accessing this compassionate caring parent voice for myself... wow, I welcome this. I wish to bring this into my way of thinking and processing more and more."
69,"In addition to listening, soothing and letting younger me I had power to look after us, etc., one thing I did with her is play because that's what she asked for in a T session way back when. She just said ""I want to play"" at a time when I/we came face-to-face with knowing clearly I had never had parents and never would and like you're finding, I/she was in so much pain.  It felt a bit silly sometimes, but it also felt good  And making an effort to balance the pain with joy, fun, laughter made a real difference in getting through it all and in her learning to trust me and look to me.  Maybe it's something you could try with younger you - draw, colour, sing, dance, whatever makes her laugh and feel happier. She just doesn't ache for care/comfort/support like she did and so she doesn't pop up in my adult relationships like she used to. My teen still does but I'm working on that  I just remembered that one way I got 'in touch' with her was to use my non-dominant hand to write to me.  That was at first when I was just trying to hear her though so you might be past this.

79,"I caught my one garden neighbour attempting to gaslight me today. I suggested to her today that she might have noticed that that huge pile of branches and sticks and stuff has been waaaaay reduced? And that I spent 3 afternoons on it in Nov. and 8 trips with the cargo bike. Which was in the end too much for me. So next year, could she please participate in some of that type of work too?? Seeing as she has a car and most of the stuff was her garden refuse to begin with?""But you said you wanted to keep that to repurpose it!"" I did not. I asked her if she wanted to keep it for some reason to which she said she didn't but she wouldn't cart it away either. Today I merely repeated the italicised bit to her. Then I wondered something similar to something I've wondered about FOO before too, something like ""how can this intelligent person get it so mixed up?"" (She is a doctor after all, it does involve some amount of brain power getting to that point.)But now I remember: narcs come in all sorts of professions. Claiming cluelessness is one of their trademarks. Anyway a few minutes ago I checked out Gaslighting over at OOTF. In one of the scenarios: a person ""tries to persuade you that you said or did something that you know is inaccurate"". She didn't really try and persuade me but she stated it as bald fact. It's not the first time. I'm thinking of B1 as I write. Claiming cluelessness (or forgetfulness) is trademark in my FOO too. They're all intellectually intelligent in FOO. They're gaslighters.On OOTF also: ""A gaslighting perpetrator's fabrications may be presented so convincingly and with such conviction you begin to question yourself and your own memories and judgment."" Fits. Except this time I didn't question myself for long. I thought of my defense instead. If that's what she thought, why was she dumping all sorts of other stuff on top of the pile all summer and into fall?? Not logical. But now as opposed to in my childhood and in plenty of other dealings with FOO since, I'm not going to confront her with that. It's useless. Much more useful to look at ways to act healthily for myself around a narc. My neighbour's mother is one too. No wonder I was soo soo triggered in the summer during one interaction with her. Also from OOTF: ""What NOT to do:    Don’t equate intelligence with character - just because someone can run rings around you in an argument doesn’t mean they are right.    Don’t waste your time trying to convince someone who has already made up their mind about you that they should reconsider.    Don’t argue with a person who is fabricating the facts. Wait for them to return to reality before engaging them in a discussion and do it on YOUR terms - not theirs. ""I didn't argue with her.  In FOO I was taught to argue and keep going. To not let go. Like in point 1: FOO believes that the one who wins the argument is right. I kept trying to win arguments in FOO, it was the only way to try and survive. But I've stepped back. It's a waste of time and it's a total waste of time with my garden neighbour or her mother too. "
80,  
81,"It occurred to me on the way back from T that just that one sentence from M on money is gaslighting. Her whole behaviour on this topic is a form of gaslighting.I've already written how FOO behaves on my first post on this thread. There's nothing more to say on it here, though there will be to M and F in the near future "
82,"Naming the behaviour of those w/NPD was the point when I felt free finally.  Now when someone is trying to gaslight/hoover/triangulate/confuse/etc me, I can stand firm and grounded in the midst of all that. It sounds like you are doing the same now BB - bravo!                "
83,"Well, I'm certainly getting there. That was all via email. If it had been irl or on the phone I'm not sure I would have managed, but that's one of the reasons I'm vvvlc with FOO and only communicate via email. "
84,"I am sorry if this is in the wrong section. *Trigger warning: questions about emotional abuse*....I have been wondering something lately. When does a behaviour constitute as abuse? Is it only when it is intentional behaviour?  Or can it also be part of unintended behaviour? I am currently going through a tough time with my ex. We are moving apart after 4 years of having been broken up. (It's a long story). The other day we had another long conversation about the past. He said alot of hurtful things, and I don't know how to deal with it. He accused me with making him feel worthless at times, and that he is scared of me now that I will explode in anger at him for something he hasn't done. That I am untrustworthy because I didn't tell him the whole story of why I broke up with him. I feel that this is a little unfair. I know I have worked really hard to try and build him up. I have given him compliments after compliments of what I think he is and does that makes him worthy. I have told him time and time again that he is worthy. I know I have been angry, and some of it most likely unjustly directed at him, but some of it was due to his behaviour.  And the reason why I didn't tell him I had been r* again.. was because I couldn't. I couldn't say the word, I couldn't admit it to myself. It was too much. At one point he asked me why did I want to be with him, when I knew I had mental illness. Why would I bring that into his life. I took it as a genuine question, but my friend told me that was ice cold and mean thing to say. I didn't know that I had cptsd when I became his girlfriend. I only knew about the chronic depression, anxiety and PD. And i had told him about it. I did warn him. My ex said that he now feels so worthless, and he doesn't know if that is my fault or not.  And after that long conversation I broke completely down. And he started comforting me, and I saw a glimpse of the man that I did fall in love with soon a decade ago. My friend says that kind of behaviour, breaking someone down only then to come to their rescue is somewhat abusive behaviour. But I am so scared now that I have infact been emotionally abusive towards my ex. That has NEVER been my intention. I wanted nothing but the best for him. I still do, I just don't want to be in that equation with him. And this all leaves me very confused. When does * behaviour turn into abusive? When someone else would just react with "" that's an $-5&#"" to the same treatment that would leave me emotionally incapacitated? "
85,"Hello Sceal,One situation is certainly not abusive and that was you not telling him about the r*. You don't ""owe"" anybody that information. Also, if talking about it might trigger you or even just upset you, then self-care first!I also don't think you owe him the whole story of why you broke up with him. I think it was mean and unfair of him to ask you why you 'brought mental illness' into his life. It sounds as if he wants to blame you for any problems he has. You were open about the diagnoses you knew of and if he has now been shaken a bit off course, well, who knows what undealt with stuff he has in his past. Anyway, if he didn't notice enough amiss in your behaviour to want to break up with you before you and he knew about cptsd, then I think it's bogus to be blaming you now. For more information, you could check OutOfTheFog e.g. https://outofthefog.website/traits/ Top 100 Traits for PD. I know you say you have a PD but you're aware of that. For me, that's the crucial difference really. Are you aware of your behaviour and taking responsibility, or not? Your ex could have a PD too, but a different one maybe?"
86,I completely agree with Blueberry. I think your ex is being very unfair to you.
87,"Sorry it took me so long to reply. I don't really think my ex is being abusive, but I wish I could tell when someone is. I don't know where the line goes. Although, I do feel he is being incredible unfair to me. his behaviour hasn't been very kind lately - and perhaps I don't deserve kindness. But I don't believe I deserve this thing either. "
88,"Dear Sceal,Of course you deserve kindness, just like everybody else on the planet, as my T would say! Meaning that we cptsd-ers aren't somehow defective and have to work extra hard just in order to be treated with basic decency. Or at the very least you certainly don't deserve unkindness and unfairness. Neither of those are setting healthy boundaries. I would say we all 'deserve' to have people in our lives who set healthy boundaries instead of treating us unkindly and unfairly. Does that make sense?"

90,"Hello Pk74 and welcome to the forum I'm sorry to hear you're having a bad time atm. If you're worried your wife might hurt you physically then please reach out in real life e.g. to the police. If you mean you're worried about emotional hurt from your wife, then hang in there. You feel like living in trauma everyday could mean you're in what we call an Emotional Flashback or EF or it could mean you're still in an abusive situation. For information on EFs, "" Emotional flashbacks (EFs) are one of the most common symptoms of CPTSD and involve mild to intense feeling states (e.g., anger, shame, fear) that were felt in past trauma, and are layered over present day situations. For example, a person who grew up with a parent who was angry and abusive may react with sudden intense fear to a minor conflict at work and not understand what is happening or why because often people with CPTSD do not connect these feelings to past trauma.  Emotional flashbacks are contrasted by the visual flashbacks experienced withPTSD where sufferer sees the traumatic event replayed in their mind’s eye.""  Or check here: https://cptsd.org/forum/index.php?topic=2589.0"
91,Thanks blueberry yes i mean emotionl hurt i feel she neglects me emotionaly she says its cos she doesnt know how to be with me even when i'm crying she doesnt comfort me
92,"This sounds really rough. Sorry you are going through this. Hopefully you will feel better soon, or at least begin to understand why you are feeling so upset all the time. Take care! "
93,"Thanks for clarifying. If you feel up to it, it might help you to read this thread sometime: https://cptsd.org/forum/index.php?topic=12309.0If it's not too close, here's a supportive   We are here for you on the forum."
94,"Hello and welcome to the forum! I'm sorry to hear how little support you're feeling. It can be very difficult for our loved ones to know what to do, esp if they're afraid of inadvertently hurting us further. Or sometimes they can feel threatened by our intensity. I'm speaking out of personal experience so idk if that's your situation.I hope you continue to post here and speak about the things that are troubling you. I think you'll find support, encouragement and invaluable help here!  "
95,Hi does anyone know of any uk support groups for cptsd warriors i feel connecting with ppl in similar circumstances would be benificial tia
96,"Have you checked our UK resource section? https://cptsd.org/forum/index.php?board=266.0 I can't remember off-hand if there's anything relevant for you there, so pls take a look."
97,"Hi everybody. Today marks 30 years since my Father died.He was my primary abuser and is responsible for much of what I suffer with today.When your primary abuser is a parent, it alters your entire sense of reality. All of the typical answers don’t apply because the people that should give you strength and support are the people who abuse you. There is no place for you to find unconditional love, and there is no place to learn how to love and how to accept love from others.I know I’m kind of rambling, but it feels right. Normally, I don’t give this day too much thought, but lately my Therapist and I have been working on my issues with him that still haunt me. This made today more present in my mind and therefore, more unavoidable.I am sad. I am angry. I am confused. I am lonely, and I hurt.I just wanted to get it out somewhere as I don’t feel comfortable sharing things this deep with anyone, except maybe my wife."
98,"Mike, I hear you, your sadness, anger, hurt. My words feel weak, but I feel for you."
99,"So sorry you are feeling this way 30 years after your F's death.  Sadly one thing about Complex PTSD is that time does not heal all wounds but allowing ourselves to remember and feel in the company of caring others who understand can go a long way in healing/recovery. So if rambling feels right then go right ahead, we're here to listen and support you    "
100,"It seems our backgrounds are very similar...I know, very well, what it is like to have no sense of ""home"", ""shelter""... or a ""trusted embrace"".I have been extremely lucky to have married a person who is from a background where ""home"" is a very concrete concept, that can be trusted and relied on.  And some day, I hope to understand what ""home"" really feels like.  But, it is still foreign to me, even after 26 years of being in this relationship.Luckily she has patience...I have picked up writing poetry, again, after 30 years of only technical writing (I am a programmer, and I write instruction manuals for the applications that I create).  This as kept my skills sharp, but kept me blissfully away from any emotional content.Unfortunately, hiding in this way, just forces the ""demons"" to surface in other areas.  The creative writing serves as a ""safer"" way to get some of this out... a pressure release of sorts.My advise... do consider the source  ... read the areas that peak your interest in this forum... when you feel ready, write something... pour it out... then post it before you can talk yourself out of it."
101,"That's sound advice! Thank you!I believe that many of us share common experiences as our particular brand of ""damage"" comes from a specific set of circumstances. Thanks for the kind words. I also married a woman who had a very strong sense of family and a strong sense of home. In my 33 years of marriage I have learned the ways of family and mourn for the loss of mine."
102, 
103,What's the most helpful and comforting someone has said to you?What do you wish someone had said to you in different situations?I'm writing an article and would love some help! http://ptsdsafe.com/what-to-say-to-someone-with-ptsd/Thanks buddies! 
104,Welcome replies both here and on the blog itself 
105,"Just want to point out (and kindly so), that Complex PTSD is different than PTSD in that it is the result of ongoing relational trauma vs single/short term non-relational trauma, and has three additional symptoms.  From a treatment perspective it's important to make the distinction, but also so that people understand what survivors are dealing with (layers of abuse/neglect at the hands of others). The most comforting thing anyone could say to me me ""I am so sorry for what you've endured and continue to struggle with, what can I do to help?"""
106,"Most helpful:""I am so sorry for what you went through. I am here for you.""""I believe you.""If I tell someone some details of what I am feeling, it does help me when they repeat back to me. Eg. Me: ""I feel like I'm drowning. I am going crazy."" Friend: ""You feel like you're drowning and that you're crazy. That sounds awful and scary."""
107,"Quote from: notalone on September 13, 2019, 10:27:27 PM""I am so sorry for what you went through. I am here for you.""""I believe you.""and the mirroring thing, that's golden! I'll add that to the article! Thanks!"
108,"Most helpful - ""I'm so sorry that happened to you!""Other comments that have helped, either made to me or that I've read, are ""CPTSD is not an illness, it's an injury"" and ""Our symptoms are normal reactions to abnormal circumstances"". Probably not the type you're looking for but thought I'd throw them in there anyway. "
109,Things that have made me feel (even slightly) better:It's okay. or  It's going to be okay.It's not your fault. That IS messed up. You didn't deserve this. I love youyou deserve to be loved tooI've got this for youI've got your back
110,Good Day wonderful people.I just spent 3 months in a place of safety: no phones; no emails; simple meals; green forests and the most amazing bird life I have ever seen.Hypervigilance is 4/10. Social anxiety is 5/10. Etc. I can let my kids play in the garden without worrying obsessively about them. I am emotionally available to my new partner and my kids.It was expensive and I couldn't have done it without the help of my family but I feel so much better. C-PTSD is an injury and like other injuries we can heal from it.Take care...LTLTR
111,"I'm really pleased to hear this, you certainly deserved some respite.Long may it last for you."
112,That sounds like a wonderful place and the perfect place to heal!  Well worth the money!
113,"Oh, sounds marvelous! Internalize it with your heart and soul. Pull it out from your memory whenever needed!Old topic, but had to answer  "
114,"***PRE-EMPTIVE APOLOGIES FOR A LONG POST***Yesterday I returned to youth coaching. Bowling, for the record, as I bowled in college and still love to bowl competitively.Yesterday was the best day that I have had in several years.Originally, I was coaching when I worked at my old job. When they laid us off, I had to take 2 jobs to replace the income and I had to work on Saturday mornings.When I took my current job, the part time money helped, and so I kept the part time Saturday job.The owner of that store suddenly decided to close in March of  this year. I was given only 2 days notice, but I had been promoted recently at work and so I seriously was starting to question the value of working 6 days per week.Yesterday felt like such a success! The kids (age 7-12) are just at the age where you can teach them solid fundamentals and really have an impact on their game for years to come. It is also an age where bowling should be play and it should be fun, so coach Mike has only 2 rules: Rule #1: Bowling is fun. Rule #2: If bowling isn’t fun, do something fun instead.Meeting the kids for the first time is fun, I try to take a very positive and cheerleading attitude when I am coaching them and sprinkle in a little bit about swing mechanics, balance, lane conditions, targeting, and of course, lane courtesy.The parents are always funny, especially the first week. They’ve got to let you know about their child’s needs, strengths and weaknesses. I have one Dad that is a little overbearing with his son in his coaching. Fortunately, we have a policy of no parents in the settee area, so the boy just stays up by the lane and I can coach him independently of his Dad. He already commented that bowling was more fun yesterday.By the end of the session, the kids were smiling and happy, I had made some new friends, and earned the trust and respect of more than a few parents.This is a huge thing for me. I haven’t felt this type of satisfaction in a very long time. When I broke down a few months ago, I hoped that a day like this would still be possible.  I believe that this was a huge step for me, and I wanted to share.I hope that it encourages others to keep working at getting healthy.I’m sorry for rambling but I felt like I should explain why I coach and why it means so much to me."
115,That's awesome! So glad you're doing something you love. Inspiring & encouraging!  
116,"That's great, Mike    "
117,"Hi mikenoodle, it's great to hear that you are recovering and getting and creating joy from again doing something you love. Thanks for sharing.  "
118,Thank you for sharing. That is fantastic!  
119,"I ran into a male Narc on the retreat. What I'm really calling him in my head is somewhat different  However Narc Woman at the two yoga places, Narc Male this time. Now I understand what I've read over at OOTF about how a Narc will get even an experienced therapist onto their side or will blind this therapist or literally charm them. The retreat place is a bit difficult to get to without a car so car-pooling not uncommon. I was collected half-way by Narc Male. In hindsight, I should have said ""Let's wait till we actually get there"" but I knew from what he said that he was pretty experienced in therapy of this type so figured he'd respect general rules of these places, like avoiding advice. NTS: Experience in therapy doesn't mean safe. At some point the conversation turned to the past and family roles and so on. After he'd taken the floor for a while, I mentioned some of mine and he started doing therapy with me, basically. I did stop the conversation but not as early as I needed to. I did some Justifying before that (JADEing = Justify, Argue, Defend, Explain - another acronym from OOTF) not to mention Defending (myself). Narc Male did a lot more of the Arguing (taking the side of FOO) and Explaining (my own reactions to me as well as family systems).  A bit on the late side for my own safety, I said it was time to end the conversation.  ....I came out of the long weekend and indeed through the weekend in a much better state than even the second time with Narc Woman, and miles better than the first time with N.W. I'm doing fairly well, feel quite stable.  "
120,"Congratulations on your progress! It doesnt always feel great, but its worth it."
121,  I'm glad you feel better coming out the other side? And you were able to stop him before he railroaded you into a bad place.   
122,"Blueberry,You recognized what was happening, you realized you were JADEing and defending, you put up boundaries. Huge growth.   "
123,Great job! 
124,So impressed with how you handled this situation.  
125," Yes, blueberry, that was really great that you could set boundaries, no matter it was a bit late. You could do it, and so you will be able in the future to do it, too. My experience is: If you get the knack of something then you can do that quicker and quicker.And what a bad luck you have with that narcissists!!"
126,"Thank you so much everybody!  You all pointed out the most important aspect: I came out the other side and have progressed though doing that. I also came out in a much, much, much better state than when I was railroaded by a bunch of narcs (last time I was with FOO) and of course the two N.W. occasions. It does get easier each time. The first time I really noticed Narcs, though I didn't know the term at the time, was a run-in with my parents a few years ago. I ended up moving in and out of reality and have no memory of most of it. I ended up on the closed ward for a few days. It took me a further few weeks at home to really come back to earth and to stop it feeling as if parts of me were gliding in and out. Also for me to stop thinking I could be in two different places at once. Yikes. Pretty far along the dissociation spectrum for those few weeks. Next run-in with FOO, including B1 and SIL2, was way worse because it was all adults in FOO except SIL1 protecting each other, gaslighting etc. etc. But I managed not to dissociate! I didn't end up on the closed ward, or anywhere else of that nature. I actually felt tons of pain and sadness instead and could hardly stop crying for a couple of days and especially nights until I got out of there. I travelled 1500 km home by myself, which hadn't been possible the previous time. I don't think I managed to set boundaries either of those FOO times. But I did with Narc Woman, much earlier and more forceful by the second time with her too. So yes, I'm getting better at it. This time with Narc Male I was in some amount of emotional distress and feelings of endangerment, but not as much as with Narc Woman.    So thanks everybody for helping me realise it  "
127,"Listen to your gut--it's there to help you, and it's right. If corrected, it can evolve, but generally you know what you know.Therapists are not sacred or perfect, the same way parents aren't. You know what you know. As I've grown stronger, it's easier to hear myself and see these people for what they are, and to improve avoiding them, or saying no. Sometimes we can't, and as we get even stronger I think we can better recover from that, too, like we are slowly building gas masks that let us survive the small mandatory amounts of time where they can't be avoided.It sucks that it sounds like you were going on a healing retreat, and then these people are everywhere. I think that's just life, and a bummer, but as you get stronger they will matter less. "
128,Hi Blueberry. Just wanted to give a   for your amazing progress and say thank you for sharing your journey. You are an inspiration to me.  
129,"blueberry, having had my own horrific experience w/ a narc t, i'm just sorry you've run into them on retreats, no less!  i am with everyone else, tho, in giving you so much credit for your progress in recognizing and setting/holding boundaries, and coming out the other side feeling better for having done the retreat.  that is amazing to me, how you did that!  i think i would've flown into an EF before that car ride was over, and it would've soiled my entire weekend experience.  i'm in awe of the progress you've made!  well done!   thanks for sharing this.  it helped me see the work i still have to do, at the same time giving me a guide as to how to get thru something like this and end up more positive than before.     you are an inspiration.  love and hugs."
130,"Thanks all for your replies and cheers.I decided not to write more about Narc Male or interactions with him for the time-being. Partly I was helped by being able to email the therapist in question after I was back home. That way I felt heard even if she didn't understand totally, and I got it out of my system a bit.  You're right, Scout, the stronger I get, the less these types of people matter. Annoying, yes, even triggering, but I no longer have to give them headspace for days and weeks on end. A sentence I got to repeat in various stages of the retreat was: ""My perceptions are true"" and variations like ""My feelings are correct"".I know therapists aren't perfect, they're people too etc. etc. but apparently (at least according to experience and wisdom on OutOfTheFog) narcs are good manipulators. They can get people on their side pretty easily, even therapists. During and after this run-in with Narc Male, memories started coming back up of times when I saw through somebody's behaviour days and even weeks before anybody else did, e.g. one time in inpatient therapy with my roommate. Not to mention years with B1. "
131,Steps forward leaving him behind you.  Good for you.  Glad your were heard.    
132,"This week has been especially tough in terms of my relationship with my H.  He came down with a nasty infection that required three visits to the ER which is about 40 mins from where we live. That was not a problem at all, I am great in an emergency but in the midst of all that came 2 offers on our house.  Not a problem either but it does add up.  What got to me is that I am married to a man who does not like to be dependent and does not take kindly to being brought to his knees by pain. I struggled with him over everything from telling the doctor how bad things were (he minimized the pain which I understand is related to his gender, military and family training but it doesn't get you the pain meds and required a 2nd trip to the ER and my having to step in and tell the doc what it was really like when once again he would not fess up), to meds, to eating and drinking fluids, to well, everything. Part of me totally understood he was in pain and this was so hard for him but another part shot back into being a child and teen at home when my NPD/alcoholic F would control and dominate me and nothing I did was ever right or good enough.  I fought it but eventually on the last trip into the ER I spilled tea all over myself on the drive in and lost it.  Whoa, what is this telling me? I am overtired and angry at my H and need to tell him and I did. I wish all of me could have stayed calm and objective, but the fact of the matter is my trauma is still there and won't let me just yet.  At least when I did 'have words"" with my H I was able to tell him exactly what was wrong and why and that he needed to back off, let me take care of him, show some appreciation and stop arguing about every little thing.  I also told him I loved him and understood he was in a lot of pain.  Fair enough. "
133,   I'll write more later.
134, 
135,  That is a lot all at one time.
136,"     nursing someone who puts up all kinds of walls in your way is no easy thing - having all that other stuff going on at the same time, yeah, i'm not surprised you went down the rabbit hole to the past, kizzie.  i'm really glad you were able to talk to him about it - i hope he took what you said to heart and has backed off his 'macho' crapola.  thanks for sharing."
137,"  Thanks for sharing, for being real with your feelings and being able to let us know how you handled them.  Heres hoping that next week has fewer challenges for you.  "
138,"Fortunately the tea did not scald me but I had to sit in the ER for 5 hrs and travel around with my H as he had various tests sporting a giant stain down the entire front of my shirt.    A bit too conspicuous for someone who likes to fly under the radar in public.  I am glad I didn't try to hold it in any longer (that was not happening lol) and was able to communicate how I felt about him (""love you and so sorry you are in such pain"") and his behaviour (""not crazy about how you're behaving""), I just wish I could have been a bit calmer. Maybe I would have been if I'd spoke up earlier.    In any event, he's been great since then and back to his old self   "
139,Glad he's been back to his old self.  Hope he feels better.  And good job speaking up for yourself. 
140,"Quote from: BeHea1thy on July 01, 2019, 12:50:05 AMWhen it comes down to it, the pain of the past  propelled you into a new improved communicator who was able to say what needed to be said, (his needs, your needs) even though that preferred calm aura was delayed. Don't be hard on yourself.   "
141,"Being a male, I had a really hard time explaining my feelings to my wife until I realized that my lack of communication was making matters worse. As a man, I had a really hard time admitting the intense fear I was feeling all of the time to anyone, but I realized that this was doing no good for either of us, especially as the fear began morphing into anger. Sometimes it's hard for us men to give in to our emotions because even though it's wrong, we feel weak when this happens. I don't like that trait and have learned to get over it in the last few months. I only mention this because I understand where you're coming from. I needed a talk like you gave to your husband and my wife was the perfect one to do it. Because I don't want to hurt the one person I really trust in this world, I do try to be calm with her and that has helped me to be more in touch with my emotions. We're both seeking therapy to get over a recent tragedy and after her talk, I respected her feelings enough to try to control my own. My hope is that your husband took your conversation to heart, and I personally think it was the right thing to do. For me, even the many trips to the ER would've been hard even without the house to deal with as well. All in all I'd say you handled yourself really well."
142,"Just what I needed to hear Clay and bravo to you for being able to talk openly and honestly about your situation.   A lot of my H's behav does seem to be gender related (that shalt not appear weak or vulnerable), but also to his own family who never talked about anything remotely emotional and heaven forbid you ever show any anger.  So when something comes up that makes him really angry or afraid it comes out sideways.  Fortunately he's generally pretty even keeled but life has a way of throwing everyone curve balls, things we're not ready for and we landed there again. He was back to his old self, but then wham and he went into what I now see as a freeze and fight trauma response which triggered me again.  He doesn't trigger often but when he does he's just as incapacitated as those of us dealing with CPTSD (I'm not certain he has full blown CPTSD but perhaps a mild version).  Two triggered people make a rational, connected and caring conversation difficult. Anyway, we managed to get through this second situation but it was so painful and like you and your wife, we feel it's time to get some therapy once we're in our new home.  Glad to have your perspective so thanks for sharing  "
143,"I don't know where to start. It has been a long week (or life) and I am looking for ideas or help. My CPTSD is a result of coming from a single parent home with the only parent having BPD. It was very difficult and still is. My mom died about 9 years ago and I thought it would get easier because she wasn't breathing down my neck, but it has not. The plot thickens because my husband of 23ish years does not think CPTSD is real and I should just get over it because every one has a rough childhood. He has continued to blame me for all of his life problems because somehow I created them. I am, apparently the reason for all of his life struggles. For the past 3 years, he has been on many very heavy hitting medications for an injury and has been increasingly coming down on me for wrecking his life. His mood swings are directly related to the cycle of medication in the day. I feel helpless because I know he acts the way he does primarily because of the medication, but that does not stop the hurt. He has now resorted to lecturing me in the same manner that my mom did for my entire life. In a nut shell, he is my trigger and my mom now. I have been in therapy to try and resolve childhood issues but it has become complicated with his ""new"" role.Any ideas would be appreciated."
144,"A therapist would be very useful in this situation. He or she would be able to guide you through this in ways that would be helpful. It's next to impossible to heal from the past when it's being repeated in the present. It would be like trying to patch someone up while they're still in the middle of a boxing match. You may find useful ideas and support at the Out of The Fog site, https://outofthefog.website.  (He sounds like he may be a narcissist or have narcissistic tendencies.) There is also a supportive forum there. Their sections describe what it's like to be in a relationship with an individual who suffers from a personality disorder, with helpful articles on Do's and Don'ts. This brief YouTube video may have some ideas that might work when you are in a situation where you have to respond to your husband. https://youtu.be/6TSh9zTHz2kYou say your husbandQuotedoes not think CPTSD is real and I should just get over it because every one has a rough childhood.  CPTSD is not an illness, it is an injury. It is caused by our exposure to multiple traumatic events that are perpetrated on us by people we depend on and from which we feel there is no escape. It is not in how you think, and it is not in your imagination.Finally, if you ever feel you're in danger, http://www.hotpeachpages.net has lists of resources for people who are experiencing domestic abuse.Please keep us updated, we care about you!"
145,"Thank you. I will look them up. This is not an impossible situation, but very overwhelming. "
146,"It is overwhelming Zeekoctane and that can make it difficult to think/feel/act which is why our sister site is called ""Out of the Fog"" and we're ""Out of the Storm."" You've taken the first step by coming here so you can talk about what is going on, bring down that sense of being overwhelmed and figure out what to do.             Out of the Fog has a lot of good tools for dealing with someone who suffers from a PD if that's the case for your H. The next step might be to find a trauma therapist - there is some useful info here and helpful forms here.  Also, there's an info sheet about CPTSD for families here you could give to your H and gauge whether he is at all receptive to hearing about what you're genuinely struggling with.  "
147,Hi Zee May I ask were there problems in the relationship before the meds and its increased since? The projection of someone's difficulties on a close person is so very hard and hurtful.. Is your husband in any way able to see his behaviour is not right? I know from my own recovery that being able to stand up and say what is not acceptable has been important for me and to clearly state my boundaries.. Sometimes people need a shock as to what the potential consequences of their behaviour is.. Also to speak to others about what I need is very important.. I hope you are not in any danger in the relationship... 
148,"I agree with everything that has been said already, but have just a little more to add.  As I have been on my roller coaster of healing, dealing, and at times falling apart my husband of 18 years has had to try and figure out what the heck was going on with me at any given moment.  I have been through a lot and as my trauma has resurfaced things have gotten rough.  I have changed my husband has had to learn to deal with me differently.  He has also gone through boughts of depression and I'll be honest sometimes I have pulled away and been like screw you I don't care what your going through I have to take care of me.  I'm not saying that's the best move for marriage but at the time I mentally couldn't take caring for my kids, myself, and my husband acting like a jerk.  I have set boundaries with him that he is like where did that come from?  You have to take care of you before you can take care of anyone else. You are not alone.  Good luck navigating the medication maze. "
149,"Thank you all. I have tried many times to get him to read up on CPTSD but he is not interested. My healing process has been long and drawn out because he is not very supportive of me. He wants a quick fix for my problems so he can get on with his life. I find myself saying, ""I'm sorry."" about a million times a week. I know this is not my fault, but I still feel the need to say it. I have recently switched to a new T who has offered me many positive approaches to help myself, but not so much on how to interact with my H.There has always been a bit of a struggle in our marriage because of my CPTSD, but it has come to an overwhelming pinnacle since his injury (meds). I have all I can do to keep my son's life normal. I do not want him to suffer the consequences of such rough waters. There are things I have to do because of the medications (i.e. sleep on the couch to make sure he is not cooking in the middle of the night and burn the house down or driving because he has no memory of what he does). I feel the need to stay awake to keep my son safe because what if my H thinks there is a burglar when really it is my son.. These actions (too many to list) compound my already complicated actions from dealing with CPTSD. I do not get rest and cannot focus on healing myself."
150,Forgive me for being blunt Zee but from what you've described it sounds like life is not normal or more importantly safe for your son and won't be until your H changes/reduces meds. It's potentially a life threatening situation and you being on guard 24/7 is not possible to maintain. Is there somewhere you and your son or your H could go until his medication issues are sorted out? Can you talk to your doctor about his behaviour on the medication?  
151,"I have spoken with his doctors and they say it is fine. I have made arrangements with my brother and our bags are set if we need to go. The problem is my H has no one to care for him. We have been close a few times, but have not gone. I feel like a person who is between a rock and a hard place. Maybe I can find my strength here. Thank you for caring."
152,"You are important. You are worthy of safety. You are worthy of being believed. Your story is true. You are strong and courageous even if you don't feel it.Most of all, you are worth taking care of, even at the expense of others who are not taking care of themselves. It's honorable that you feel compassionate toward him, but you and your child are and should be the highest priority. Gentle, supportive hugs to you as you navigate these rough waters. "
153,"See if I were you I would document the episodes that your H is having to full extent of the scariness including cooking and trying to drive and not remembering, thinking your son is a burglar, take those back to his doctor.  Tell him you fear for the safety of your son and yourself with him and you don't feel safe leaving him alone because he doesn't remember what he does and something needs to change.Make the doctor listen and if he doesn't ask him for a second opinion.  Above all you need to keep you and your son safe.   . Good luck!"
154,"We try not to give advice here Zeek but in cases where a member's safety or that of their families is at risk, we're basically compelled to. I have to agree with Tee that your H's behaviour is something you need to revisit with his your doctor (or see another for a 2nd opinion) given it is putting all of you at risk. "
155,"Thankyou. I have an appointment set for the 1st. I don't mean to be wishy-washy, I guess I am just tired."
156,"Zeek, I've learnt I can come and be how I am here with no judgement..Relationships can be difficult and putting my needs before a partners has not always been easy for me... Sending u all best wishes rest well "
157,Be safe  
158,"I have sat infront of many a therapist, they dont get it, or they do to some degree, but rarely do they get the depth and nuances.  Its why i find these forums exceptional, people understand, they may have a different approach (always useful) but its welcome.In this world, with all the bad that goes on, and even though my parents used me and in some ways made me ""a giver"", having now understand more and more what happened to me, and why i have cPTSD symptoms and associated problems, i feel i want to help in the future as a therapist.  Keen to take views and thoughts to that question?Additionally though, i keep reading and have been told qualified therapists dont earn much, now as an aside, that isnt my motivation but it does matter, and i am really confused as i see therapists charging fair money in my opinion, and appreciate they may not see more than say 25-30 clients a week, but suprised they dont earn sufficiently (someone else said this again recently to me)anyway, i am rambling, but just wanted some thoughts thank you"
159,"Hi, Ive been doing therapy training myself for the reasons you mentioned. Ive had the most amazing therapist myself who encouraged me to take the therapy route as she said Id be perfect as I totally get it and can empathise with people in similar situations. She said most therapists she knows have been through some kind of big trauma which theyve managed to overcome and therefore want to train as therapists to be able to help them. I believe you have to be in it from a compassionate gain rather then a financial one, but generally believe as does my therapist that nothing we hear will phase us as weve probably lived through or witnessed worse."
160,"thank you, i appreciate that, and feel similar.  I think my confidence is wavey because its a big decision, and i do want to maintain certain lifestyle aspects, in particular so i can support the work and myself at a reasoned standard. I have a simple feeling that wins though and has been repeated - ""there arent enough people doing good, and that calls me, as much as i could challenge it and say its part of my bad parenting as being the giver, its something that might be worth embracing but with boundaries this time""(weird quoting myself)"
161,"Totally understand what youre saying. Im on my 3rd therapist myself, the first 2 were quite damaging due to their lack of understanding, now Ive found one who is totally there and gets everything I say, its made such a huge difference to my recovery process, I believe I have the qualities to do this but not sure my confidence is a hundred percent there with it yet. Good luck!"
162,"coming back on this, as i needed to think a bit further.Put simple, i think my biggest gap is empathy actually, as a child and the eldest child i was cut off from feelings as part of neglect / disassociation - its why the addictions took place etc. I understand that now. Empathy is something that has been coming through as i have worked on myself and really felt the pain i needed to work through - put another way, when you cant feel yourself its impossible to empathise. That being said, i have always wanted to help others, likely for the wrong reasons, but now, it feels its in my gift, in that so many Ts dont understand, cant relate. Now i feel it more, still working on empathy and its really shifted in the last year plus. So i think then the question is, why become a therapist, well i am good at challenging - that isnt as much of an issue for me (but i am careful with it), i am also very good at investigating and understanding the story from both an impact point of view, and working on the empathy part. I do believe this is a job i would be fulfilled in, my old skin of working has changed, and i want to work in a way that really has meaning, and i think this type of work will really help me develop solid boundaries, which is something i have also learnt in last few years and still implementingSo as much as boundaries in this profession are super key, i think in life being generous, and giving within reason is fine, as there are not enough people doing enough good, i see and feel so much pain and suffering out there. I look at homeless people so differently now, one because i can see how that was not far from my path but also, the pain to get there, and the strength to survive it, but also i observe that most people cant comprehend, and dont even try to appreciate anothers suffering. a curse and a blessing to be able to share in anothers pain i think is what i feel, and that draws me to help.That being said, keen to hear views and thoughts as i want to be challenged on this"
163,"Tbh, when I read this, my impression is: it's all about you and not about the patients / clients. I personally would stay away. Especially this: you're 'good at challenging'. Therapists thinking I needed that have done more harm than good. They didn't accept my 'No' and sometimes even retraumatised me. Although there are a few therapists or therapists-in-training here on OOTS, it's not the main point here. Our focus here is on recovery. You haven't been on the forum that long. I would appreciate more posts on your recovery."
164,"Appreciate you commenting, I need and want that type of challenge.I also have maybe over-emphasised the wrong aspects in this post, however the way men relate, is quite different, and i expect to work with men anyway (and have already been doing so)"
165,"Just my thoughts but as a survivor I personally want a T who is empathetic and doesn't challenge me but validates, guides and supports me through the process. Pete Walker is a prime example of a T who knows how to do this b/c he has professional training but is utterly compassionate and validating b/c he is a survivor.  It might be an idea to also talk with someone in the psychology department at a university near you to discuss this.    "
166,"I think i have realised that i am trying to run rather than walk, and that isnt going to help anyone.  Also the challenge is what i needed.  The post made me really question motives etc, and i think they arent clear yet and my relational approach / empathy as a result of my developmental trauma, needs more work.  I did over-emphasise the empathy gap however, but it is something i know i need to work on.  thank you"
167,"QuoteI think i have realised that i am trying to run rather than walk, and that isnt going to help anyoneTo be honest, this was my impression, too. In the past I've felt passionate about ""helping"" others - now, when I feel that way, it makes me realize that I've stumbled onto something that I myself need to do some work on. Not that I can't also help someone out, but I also see my own, dysfunctional escapism in the act of helping. Maybe a version of the fawn 4F? My codependency at its finest.  "
168,"I went to a support group a month ago for survivors of narc abuse and it was amazing.I went again this month and it was good, but I got a bad vibe off one of the other members.As we were telling our stories, he often made comments on them (we were free to make comments after they finished, but he made noticeably more than others), which were things like ""you need to not demonise the narcissist"", ""you need to take responsibility for yourself and your part in the relationship"", and ""I've learned that I need to forgive them for my own sake"". He also made sure it be known that he was a therapist, and brought it up often when he made further comments. I am not sure what other group members thought exactly, but I felt like there were a few big red flags.All the nice sounding things he said seemed to be empty platitudes, and designed to bring attention to himself, and subtle blame/invalidation to the people sharing.It was like he wanted to be seen as all healed and thus ready to fix our lives for us - he didn't really make any comments that shared any kind of vulnerability he felt. I am aware of instances of the ""f"" word (forgiveness) being used as a form of abuse, to invalidate the understandable anger, hurt and grief of a victim. I will keep going to the group, although I do hope he won't be there again.I'm so glad he's not my therapist."
169,"Did you let the group leader know about your concerns and reactions? It will be interesting to see if this person comes back again. I'm sorry he was there, he may be a therapist but tbh it sounds like he's not very aware or respectful.   if you want one. "
170,"Your group is for survivors so IMO the person needs to take off their T hat and be a survivor.  We have a guideline here about not giving advice and/or telling others what they should/should not do b/c none of us knows, we can just make suggestions based on our own experience.  Plus for me it's important in a support group to talk to each other rather than at one other.  Do you have a group leader who could talk to the person?  I've left a few groups b/c of people like this and I lost out much to my regret.  Looking back I wish I or someone would have spoken to the person. "
171,"The group coordinator did actually stop him and say that it wasn't appropriate to tell victims they are responsible for an abuser's actions, particularly in parent-child relationships.When he used his introduction to talk about how people should forgive the narcs in their lives and not demonise them, I asked him what he wanted to get out of the group, as well. It didn't seem like he was putting much of himself out there but used a lot of airtime to say how other people should be behaving.During the break, the coordinator and I both caught up for a moment and said we were both glad each other had said what we'd said.She attempts to screen newcomers to the group and has removed people from the group before for showing questionable behaviour.I will ask her if anything will happen, and I respect her a lot so I'll still be coming to the group.Yes, he should have left his ""therapist hat"" at home in the wardrobe. Our coordinator, who is a survivor herself, is also a counsellor and does a fantastic job of guiding our sessions while giving great information and support, and also opens up about her own experiences. But as a member, it's not necessary to try to be seen as an authority.I was frustrated by it and wanted to share."
172,   it's great that you have a facilitator that does listen and will speak up if need be.   
173,I'm sorry if this comment is inappropriate but to me this seems like the narc version of the Olympics.Trying to get away with that behaviour in a room full of experts on narc abuse.Just floored me to read about it.
174,"Sorry to hear that experience, and that he made you feel that way.I was trying to consider what reasonable perspective could this come from, but i struggled.  There are grounds of saying to get away from anger, and move on, forgiveness in that context could make some sense but that isnt what your post reveals.It sounds like he has a very fixed mindset and his way fits all, i have had an older male therapist who was like that and he was awful, his ego was always in the room.  Hope they can find a way to remove him.glad you posted, glad you also spoke to leader"
175,"Hi there, I'd love some thoughts on apologising about something you know you're in the wrong about, and genuinely feel ashamed of, to a member of your dysfunctional family who would probably never apologise to you despite having grounds to. I treated my sister in a mean way when she came to stay with me a few years ago. In particular, I made fun of a hobby that she is really passionate about. It was very passive-aggressive of me. I also invalidated her a bit.I don't want to deny that I was horrible to her, but it also wasn't a one-way street. She hadn't spoken to me for years before she came to stay - she only started communicating with me again when she decided to move to my city and wanted a place to stay. When she arrived, she was subtly invalidating. She's older than me, and I found that she talked down to me a lot and dismissed and invalidated my opinions; even in front of my boyfriend, she'd ""explained"" my attitudes to him, and got involved in discussions I was having with my BF when it wasn't anything to do with her. She was not job-hunting as hard as she could be, which was frustrating in my little flat, especially when I'd warned her how tough this city is for work and rent, and she'd been dismissive of my advice.After she moved out, she contacted me mostly for emotional support. I noticed that although she had friendships with people and went out and did fun things with them, she never asked me along for things like that, even though I'd introduced to my friends. She only met me one-to-one, and we'd have endless-seeming conversations about all her problems. If I tried to move the subject in a different direction, she'd drag it back to her. Then, after about forty minutes of this, she'd suddenly decide she'd want to hear about me and say, ""so... what's up with you?"". After feeling depressed by the conversation, I didn't want to open up about my life to her. I would give a minimal reply and try to change the subject, but I'm not good at thinking of other topics when I'm feeling down, so it was difficult. She seemed to make out like I was being... withholding? Immature for not speaking about myself? These conversations were really draining me emotionally, so I minimised contact with her. If I received a text angling to meet up, I'd leave it a day or two before replying. When she left the city for good, we met up and spent a nice day together. In our last few minutes together, she said that she felt like our relationship wasn't good and accused me of ghosting her. I was taken off guard, and I let her have it. I said that she was nasty, judgmental, and didn't respect me. I was really verbally attacking her - it was not completely savage but I wasn't thinking about how I wanted to behave, how it would make her feel, or how it would affect our relationship. After that, she basically didn't respond; just said goodbye and left. We didn't contact each other for months after that, possibly over a year, and we've not really addressed it.I don't feel good about how I behaved, because I didn't behave well! But I also feel hurt and used and manipulated. I know that in that situation, it probably seems like I should be the one to apologise, but I felt ambushed, set up. The positive thing is, it opened my eyes to the true nature of my relationship with this sister - she uses me - and also to my behaviour. I am not as unconscious as I was back then, but I still know I haven't resolved everything and I'm not above it yet. I don't want others to be able to manipulate me like that, so I need to grow more inside.Is apologising to her for my actions part of the process of growing internally? Should I just apologise for my part and leave it? Should I try to communicate the greater situation, which she most certainly had a hand in creating? She bullied me while she was in her teens, criticising my tastes just because it made her feel good. And then she left the family home and didn't communicate to me. It's funny; when we were arguing on our last day together, that's what she said to me - that by moving away, I'd abandoned the family, and that I'd ""ghosted"" her, even though she barely communicated to me for years, until she needed a place to stay. Is this projection? Am I projecting? I'm ok with knowing that I do some of the same negative behaviours as other family members. I've grown up with fleas, so admitting it is important for curing it. I'm just really confused about my relationship with her and I want to know that I can do something about it, that I won't look back and regret my behaviour this time."
176,"I should add, some of the reasons why being around her was so hard were:1) I was very low in social graces at that time; I struggled to direct the flow of conversation, or to respond to topics I didn't want to talk about.2) I was also very unconscious and unaware of my feelings at that time, so I wasn't really recognising how frustrated, depressed, or anxious I was feeling until it was taking me over.These two things combined meant that I didn't recognise how I was feeling, connect it with triggers from the conversation, and take action to reduce these triggers by avoiding certain topics/ending the coffee date when I was tired, or to minimise the effect on me by using self care and mindfulness to modulate my internal reactions.I hope I've improved in these areas, but I still know that I'd be nervous having a conversation with family members."
177,You could do a trial run in advance on here. Write an apology to her in Recovery Letters and see what that changes in you and your feelings.I'm now very wary of saying/writing anything to FOO members that could put me in an even more bad light than I already am in in their eyes. In the past various FOO members have used that kind of thing as ammunition against me. 
178,"Hi Blueberry, thanks, that's great advice. I've written at least half a dozen draft emails to her already, but perhaps putting it out there where people can see it and receiving some feedback will help me see it in a new light. I am very wary of putting myself in a position where I could be seen in an even more bad light, too, so it is a relief that I am not the only one thinking this way.Of course, I would love to just give a heartfelt apology, take full responsibility for and own my actions, and perhaps even be forgiven and move forward in our relationship. However, in my toxic family environment, I feel like that could be used against me. I'm so confused.I will go ahead and write this apology and post it. Thanks again for the great advice. I want to move forward in this area so badly, I am always spiralling out of my mind because of it."
179,"I so get that apologizing often means it will be used against us - nothing worse than the smug smile you see on an abuser's face when you've tried to be the better person!  I do think though that a bit of grit is not a bad thing to be on the receiving end for our family members.  I'm not talking about being passive aggressive so much as being more open and forthright about feelings, in your case about what your boundaries are when it comes to your S. It saves us from being PA which just inflames things in my experience and like you I never felt good about stooping to their level.  I have taken my parents and B to task in as honest a fashion as I could a few times (not yelling or hurtful but stating how I feel, what I will not put up with in a firm, respectful manner), and it resulted in establishing much needed boundaries. "
180,"Hello all. I was diagnosed with Cptsd in 2012, although I’ve had it since the late 70’s. Back then I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder & Depression. This forum is wonderful & you are all helping me so much. Thank you. This is my second post and I am somewhat embarrassed to share this info, but feel many of you may understand. I find that when I go out in public, doesn’t really matter where, I find myself starting conversations with fellow shoppers, check out clerks, hair stylists, etc, btw, these are complete strangers,  where I say what I think are funny remarks & proceed like I am a comedian. I find myself overtalking. Most people respond okay, but I feel like a fool after I do this because my humor is sophomoric & juvenile. I am 64 years old, but I oftentimes behave like a young teenager. I can’t seem to control myself.I feel compelled to behave like this. I have not matured properly. I get nervous around people and just start talking. I don’t know how to just talk normally. I was my FOO’s jokster. I think it was the only way I could get any attention in my depressing home. Does anyone else have this problem? I am aware that I do this so I don’t do it as much as I used to. I catch myself & try to stay quiet, but it is difficult. I can only go out sporadically when I am having a fairly good day. This overtalking is ridiculous & embarrassing. Any help would be very appreciated. Thank you for listening & being there. "
181,"Hi Patticake,Welcome to the forum.  I'm glad you felt brave enough to share this information, and I know how tentative I was when I first posted here - it took me a long time to pluck up courage to do so.  I relate to what you've said here - although I do experience anxiety in social situations, I can find that when I do speak to people - it will depend on which part of myself is present - in terms of what I might say or how I might relate to them.  I often feel like a much younger person inside, and I have also served the function in my family of 'being what they required me to be' - if that makes sense - so I've entertained them, fawned to them, and been a bit like a chameleon sometimes.  I'm glad that people respond ok to you - when you talk to them, because I suspect they might appreciate your openness, but at the same time, I know it can feel awkward to not feel in control of how you are.I think I restrict myself sometimes, as I fear how I might be - but in honesty - I am finding that when I'm allowing myself to be more open and authentic, that people seem to appreciate it.  Patticake, I don't know if my ramblings are helpful at all here - but I wanted you to know that I relate to what you're saying, and I'm glad you're here in the forum.Hope  "
182,"Oh my goodness, this is so me! I'm 62 and trying so hard to tone it down some and not feel I have to perform, or be funny, in order to fit in. I'm working on finding out who I truly am under the mask I wear, and communicating from that place instead of putting on my clown hat. Thanks for your post. "
183,"I am just the same, Patticake!Since deciding to divorce me, my husband has said that he found me embarrassing because of this. I was very upset, but when I talked about it to the people who have been supporting me, both professionals and friends, they have said that they don't see this as something to be ashamed of. It has been quite a revelation. I think my recent traumas have led me to calm down a little, much like you talk about. So my feeling is that you are finding a happy medium, and that most people will respond very positively to you.Lovely to meet you here for the first time. Libby "
184,"My friend is worried about me. He knows my history with my husband and it was mostly assumed to be in the past. A couple incidents of abuse happened in the last 6 months though and he told me he genuinely can’t understand why I stay. He’s trying to figure out what he’s missing. I don’t even know what to say. How do you make someone understand you love your abuser? I’m sitting here trying find the words, the right explanation on why it’s not that simple to pack a bag and walk out.Don’t need actual answers, just thought maybe others feel or have felt the same. "
185,I stayed in normal contact and then after a period of low contact I got into normal contact with my parents and other FOO mbrs. Maybe not quite the same but there were people around me who queried that one. So I do understand. It can take time to remove yourself from dysfunction. I suppose you / we don't have to make somebody else understand. We just have to know for ourselves. 
186,"My abusers were my family so I stayed when I was a child b/c I had no choice.  When I became an adult though I stayed in contact  b/c I hoped they would change and would love me as I wanted and deserved.  I loved them and wanted them to love me and I really thought if I just did or said the right thing that would happen.  It didn't and when I finally realized that, I had no choice but to go no/low contact because my health (psychological  and physical) was suffering.  In my case people didn't understand why I left (b/c my family did not appear abusive), so that's different from your situation but perhaps the underlying feelings of why we stay are. "
187,"I answered that question once with the response, ""Well, I guess because it's the only thing I know."" We live what we've learned... It takes time to unlearn patterns of behavior.Be kind to yourself.   "
188,"Three Roses, I loved your response! B1ackbird, I can definitely relate to why you stay with your husband.  Although I have never been in a physically abusive relationship, I was in an emotionally abusive one for 10 years in my youth.  When I left the relationship, even I didn't understand why I had stayed in  such a relationship so long but now I do after learning about C-PTSD."
189,"From my personal report:2019/02/13 around 10:57 AM London timeThe person I saw once with the laptop in the 8th computer area, likely because the other area was full.I must not be interested in the reasons or intentions, but rather in the library rules as those can protect anyone's freedom to use the computer, as much as the library does the job properly.Technically, a booked sessions works with 10 minutes waiting time available to log-in. When I reported the act to the librarian I was shy initially, the person pretended it was alright, then waited for the booking to expire. Unfortunately, it was just 5 minutes before the booking was going to expire.To avoid any similar problem in the future, at the moment I think the best to point to be 2 minutes earlier than the booking start, so if any problem like this arise in the future, the librarian has enough time to handle it properly.I have reason to believe the person may be abusive, and I suggest a firm solution.The reason I use that computer is that is on the corner and I can have some privacy, depending if anyone is using the one close to it. The reason I need a computer is homelessness. The reason of homelessness are geographical, C-PTSD, past abuse, background and luck. However, all this must makes literally 0 difference in the treatment received and perpetuated.I've to add the booking system can have maximum 2 sessions booked in the future, including the current one no matter if logged in or not (a booked session would expire if not logged in 10 minutes after the booked time). A session generally our or less (it depends on opening/closing time and if there are other sessions booked).I've add a booking at 10:47, and another one at 11:47. The one at 10:47 went lost as he managed to wait until the booked expired, then the 11:47 was left.2019/02/13 around 11:53 AM London timeThat person doesn't move, I go to the librarian, who checks the library booking system.I then inform him the person he's still there, then the librarian goes and tells the person to move.The person tells the librarian he needs the plug or something. Likely he wanted the private space.However, that must not interest me. Also, this is a library, and anyone has the right to use the space, that's why there's a booking system.In is time frame it was me who booked it, then I had the right. If multiple people want to use the same area, then they've to organize and the booking system can allocate a time to each one, ideally, depending on the library.The person eventually moves, but as soon as the librarian is away and he pass me while I'm coming to the computer, he says ""*"", I reply ""you"", and that's the end of it.I don't know if that was the best reply, but something is sure, I was in one thread started by Blueberry, it is ALWAYS better to let it out than swallow it!So good job here.The incident is recorded to have a good history of the abuser. Any further abuse must also be recorded.Any single accident must be reported so that I can work well to protect I.C. and prevent any abusers from perpetrating their actions.------------------------I had planned to post this if required, and I thought it was after the last incident.Thank you for reading.   "
190,"Out of this situation I've not managed to enjoy the time as I wished and planned, too.I wanted to spend some time dedicated only to myself, for once. So this time I wanted to watch some anime or TV series.Most of the sites are blocked by the library, but I hoped that at the least for anime there'd be some sites witch haven't been blocked, yet.I couldn't as when I've got hold of the computer it was already late and I had to write like flash on OOTS (I felt I need and wanted to write here), then I didn't have time.Even this post has been written in like the last 3 minutes, the computer even disconnected me for a minute. (The edit has been done onnmy phone in 2  minutes, 3 before the library closed)."
191,"I would say that this has been the most awful month of my life. But then I remind myself that I have had many awful months so it probably just feels like that.I have had to accept that my husband hasn't loved or cared for me for a long time. The root of this is clearly my cptsd, but his own issues must have played a part. I am trying not to take all of the blame, especially as all the things that stressed me, and pushed me over the edge, like having children and moving home, were things we did together. Is that reasonable, I wonder. Actually, I am beginning to see how his disgust at me has been making me worse for a long time. I have to accept, as well, that there is no relationship to be saved between me and my autistic son. I have to tell myself that he just doesn't have it in him, and even though it isn't his fault, I cannot cope with the rejection.On the other hand, I have found that I do  have some people who care and support me. They have stepped up, so to speak, because I have allowed myself to be vulnerable to them. I have been hugged more in the last few weeks, than in my entire childhood. Not difficult, as I was never hugged as a child. To round everything off, I have broken my wrist and feel so vulnerable because every tiny thing is so difficult. Trying to tell myself that if I get through this, I can get through anything. Sometimes I believe it, mostly I don't. Perhaps the balance will shift.  It doesn't help that, atm, I just can't picture a future. Anyway, just thought I would get this out of my system. Thanks for listening. Libby. "
192,"I don't think there's anything I can write that will make things better for you. I'm sending good thoughts and     I'm glad you've been getting real hugs, not just virtual ones. "
193,"Thanks Blueberry.It's the struggle with the shame, guilt and self-loathing that I am finding so difficult. I am taking all of the blame and torturing myself with how I should have been. The problem is that I was brought up to be this way. I feel so confused.Thank you so much for responding. Libby. "
194,"You are dealing with so much, and then to break your wrist... I'm so sorry.       It's good to see you have people who are supporting you in this difficult time.  Nothing good or bad lasts forever..."
195,"Thanks, Lily. I shall try to remind myself that bad things don't last forever. Am feeling a bit better atm. "
196,"Hi Libby,Glad you're feeling a bit better atm - sending you a hug and I hope your wrist mends very soon. Hope  "
197,Thanks Hope. This is going to be one of the most major challenges of my life. Starting it with a broken wrist was not a great idea!Hoping things are going well for you. Libby 
198,"Hi Libby, here is a virtual hug   and thinking of you at this challenging time and wishing you all the best for ahead. "
199,"Thanks for the virtual hug, SharpAndBlunt.  Very much appreciated.I am making a bit of progress, in that, I am staying with my daughter and I have been spending my days killing time in thecity where she lives. I would not have done this in the past as I would have been too anxious and would have thought I should have been doing something useful at home. A small victory, but a victory nonetheless.Sadly, I will have to go home at the weekend. I'll be thrilled to see my dog but terrified to see husband and sons. The shame is so deep. For me, the inner critic is the worst part of CPTSD. Take care. Libby. "

202,"Libby183-I certainly can relate to feelings of shame, and I know that in the past I have acted out of that place and been someone I barely recognize now.  You seem to be allowing yourself to feel some new things, like allowing yourself to have a leisurely time while visiting your daughter.  I think shame teaches us that we are undeserving of good feelings.  Sometimes, for me, it is difficult to notice the good feelings that try to come into my heart.Heres hoping that you can feel the good feelings that may be waiting to be let into your heart.   "
203,"Libby,My heart hurts for you that you are in so much pain. I encourage you to take one moment at a time and keep getting those real and virtual hugs.   You are worthy."
204,"I don't how to put this.Every time I've done or do something good in life or succeeded at something in life my FOO start loading their expectations on me.Why can't life be without any expectations? Expectations of others.I know it's natural for people to hope from a person who does something successfully. Still it becomes a chore to fulfill their expectations.I didn't have a healthy childhood where my personal boundaries were respected and I had an opportunity to develop my self.Any time I go by what others want from me I start to submissively do it as an act of courtesy and then I get dragged in their situation as I become more vulnerable and then become an annoyance for them which in turn creates lots of misunderstanding or I just try to escape the situation making them feel confused. The reason I even accept their requests is because of social norms and I don't have any friends or social circle so any form of meaningful social interaction outside my FOO seems valuable.Well, that was past. I'm developing my self. It's just that I try to test the waters longer than other people before putting myself out to others who come in my life. I study them in my initial interactions. And if I feel they are not worth interacting with or if the interaction could lead to the above mentioned scenario then they're better dealt with masks. There's too much emphasis on norm-al social interaction in today's society. Interaction which is and always will be taxing for me unless I wear masks to handle social situations. I can only be myself when I'm alone without much distractions, outdoors in nature or when I'm with children or with people whose personality I've studied for quite sometime even if they don't know me personally. Otherwise I'm very introverted.Success and failure. Both of them sometimes feel the same when it comes to social interaction. If other people are taken into account failure in some aspects of my life offers me freedom from their expectations yet keeps me trapped in social isolation as I don't have a social circle to begin with and nobody would want to hang out with a failure. While any success creates expectations. I don't crave for having and making new friends like most other people do. I just think social interaction is better for long term health and cognition and I should make active efforts to do it. Is it okay to just fail and keep on failing in life? Or is perseverance and practice a better strategy even if it means at times having to tactfully deal with other people and their expectations and being ready for unasked for challenges in the process?I know these are questions with pretty straightforward answers.I just wanted to know from people here at OOTS. What are your experiences in this regard? How has your successes and failures affected your relationships with people in your life? In your FOO and outside."
205,"QuoteI didn't have a healthy childhood where my personal boundaries were respected and I had an opportunity to develop my self.... The reason I even accept their requests is because of social norms and I don't have any friends or social circle so any form of meaningful social interaction outside my FOO seems valuable.Success and failure are subjective. What is a success to some may be the very definition of failure to another. In my opinion, in order to achieve success, I must first define it for what I think it is, and how that is expressed in my own life. Is service to others what is most important to me? Is a career what I find more fulfilling? As long as you are chasing someone else's ideals, for anything, I don't think you can truly be ""happy"" or fulfilled. Unless living up to others' expectations is your definition of success.I saw this quote recently - ""Failure is not the opposite of success; it's part of it."" "
206,"Your experiences of difficulty in the social realm echoes a lot of my story. But I'm not sure how much of what I can share will provide any definitive help of the sort you want. Following a horrible start to life, I sensed it would be hard for me to follow any other path but my own. It helped immensely that early on I fell into a mini-career of sorts oriented towards creativity combined with service. All of my subsequent employment involved these sorts of endeavours (non-profit as well). These provided some social contact but I built in ways to sustain my need for a good chunk of isolation, mainly in being able to live in a location that by itself is pretty isolated. Another part of this scenario is that I was often the manager or director of the activities I was involved with, so the expectations were largely set by me.Now I find myself retired, which is great except now I don't even have minimal social contacts, for the most part. Being selective in who I feel comfortable around, I have tried reaching out a bit but have found it difficult without that built-in artistic field/connection I once was so good at. I've tried some tentative sorts of reaching out with no lasting results; I get discouraged easily, though, and that's part of the problem, plus I'm so wary of people in general I'm pretty limited to what I feel I might be safe with. I'm not super-courageous in that regard; was burned too often too early.Success? Yeah, the creative artistic stuff was definitely that (mostly), especially in that I was fortunate to have enough independence and generally only my own expectations to deal with. Whenever I did have to adhere to others' expectations, I did alright but it was stressful, as my early years produced so much conflict that it made for this constant stress with regard to meeting other people's expectations. For the most part, I'd go with just being whatever you feel is best for your circumstances, without regard to calling it failure or success. Let's just call it being yourself, above all other considerations. I also concur with your assessment about working to find the means ""to tactfully deal with other people and their expectations and being ready for unasked for challenges in the process?"" It's important, I've found, to be ready for surprises, too. Calling what comes up short a failure doesn't leave enough opening for the surprises, but being yourself and following your own impulses leaves that window open. "
207,"Quote from: woodsgnomeYour experiences of difficulty in the social realm echoes a lot of my story. But I'm not sure how much of what I can share will provide any definitive help of the sort you want. It's okay. I know what I have to do in that regard. I just wanted to know experiences of others here.At times not having a social circle feels like progressing yet being stuck somewhere in life.Sure I've my FOO who are much better than they were in the past. Still most of their tastes are much different than mine so I got no one to share my life and experiences with. We are not even on the same page when it comes to core ideologies, views on life, relationships, faith and political views. Other than blood relation and shared past experiences there isn't much in common between my FOO and I."
208,"I relate to everything you've posted, so I'm going to respond with some of the positive self-talk I engage in when I'm feeling like I'm failing at life.As long as you are still trying, you are not failing.  You are a beautiful work in progress.  So if you are concerned about failing, then keep trying.  You're also not a failure if you reevaluate your goals and determine you'd be happier going in a different direction.  Maybe the goal wasn't worthwhile to begin with.I also relate to the angst over my social interaction.  I am 44, and I've always considered myself to be an introvert, but now after being treated for C-PTSD, I'm not so sure anymore.  I used to view social interactions as a kind of a test, and of course I always gave myself a failing grade.   If you view it that way, then of course you're not going to enjoy being around people.  But now I'm starting to develop boundaries and focus on myself instead of other people's reactions and expectations.  I'm finding social interactions much more enjoyable and I'm slowly coming out of my shell.  I'm still not quite sure whether I'm an introvert or extrovert, but I'm not sure it matters.  The focus should be on what makes you happy.  I will caveat that I do think whether you are an introvert or extrovert, as human beings, we need some degree of social interactions to thrive.  Some need less than others, but we all need it to live our best lives.  I wrote the above before I read everyone else's responses, but I love how we all basically saying the same thing in different ways.  "
209,"Being adopted can be weird. Today, i met for the first time, the only person (other than my son) who shares some of my DNA. And she is lovely, and normal!! So is her husband and their little boy.We found each other through DNA testing.My adoptive parents have always refused to discuss my origins - it is an aspect of the abusive relationship they engender. It is a form of control, and done out of spite and malice.I am happy that I met them. Not sure how I feel and how to process the experience.Slim"
210,"Oh wow Slim, how wonderful for you (although disconcerting too I'm sure).   I think I mentioned in another post in one of your threads way back when that I watch a show ""Lost Family"" (the US one) which is about finding biological family.  One of the feelings most adoptees seem to have is that finally connecting with biological family fills a hole they had in their hearts.   Is she able to shed light on the rest of your biological family?"
211,Congrats on finding more family! And bonus that they're people you can relate to. Awesome! 
212,"Slim :  ) Congratulations on finding blood family!Enjoy getting to know one another (filling in the blanks and making new experiences)  - sometimes not thinking too much about it helps. I was in a similar situation when my brother and I found our father 26yrs. later through family and children services. It’s weird, for sure - hahaha I am SO happy for you - a chance to make a connection and to grow with one another is gift. *milk"
213,"Hi everybody!I know I haven't posted much on here recently. A big part of the reason is that I'm finding it very difficult to communicate (more so than usual). However, I want you to know that I read some of the posts here when I can, and I think about all of you a lot. I wish I had more of the right thing to say. Others here have been a tremendous help when I've needed it the most, and I hope I can be the same at some point.I also want to thank those of you who do post replies here on a regular basis. As far as I can tell, there is no one in my life who understands what I'm going through. Although I wish no one else had similar experiences, some do, and its nice to feel like someone really cares, and understands. I'm really grateful that you help others through their tough times.Hopefully I can get through this, whatever it is, and re-engage more with life. It feels like I'm stuck in the fog right now, isolated from everything. I don't want to burden anyone. Thanks to everyone for being here. Please take a moment to feel proud of yourselves."
214,Sending you love and support Jazzy. I’ve gone through that fog many times.  Sometimes it lasts longer than others.  It’s hard for me to communicate when I’m going through the thick of it.  Kudos to you for posting when you are down.  I hope you can recognize the good in yourself that you so easily see in the other members. Safe   if it feels ok 
215,"Hi, Jazzy   Nice to see you here, despite your recent difficulties, and how hard it is to feel like we ever have anything to say that comes close to a fix for any of this shared misery. But that folks here try speaks strongly to sincerely and honestly dealing with this in ways, as you say, few can truly understand.We probably all go through times like you're experiencing when it feel like we're ""stuck in the fog right now, isolated from everything.""Please take care of yourself and feel free to contribute where and however you wish. It is really nice to know you're still journeying with everyone.   "

217,"I must be at the denial stage of my grieving process over the neglect/abuse I experienced growing up with my FOO, because all of a sudden I can't stop wondering: is unconditional love even real? Am I really missing something that other people have or are we all just walking around feeling like we're missing this thing that doesn't actually exist? If it is real, is it really true that the only way to get that unconditional love in adulthood is from yourself? Can you even give it to yourself, is that enough?"
218,"What a great question! I believe in unconditional love and in fact I believe that anything else isn't really love. The opposite of unconditional is conditional, so if your ""love"" is based on certain conditions being met, is it love at all?We absolutely need certain things from others - respect, intimacy, openness, a sense of safety. But if I base my ""love"" for someone on deriving things from them, that is conditional love. For example, if I require material wealth or 100% of their time, or if I require them to not do something like see their friends or family; or if I demand that they adhere to my beliefs instead of their own; or if I demand that they like the things I like and not the things they like; these are examples of conditional live. Love then becomes a contract based on their behavior and not on the feeling I have for them. I love my dog, unconditionally. I love my children unconditionally, and there is nothing they can do or say, or not do or say, that could make me stop loving them. This doesn't mean I have to like all the things they say or do; it just means that when that happens, the underlying love I feel is unchanged.I love my husband unconditionally. But in order to stay with him I need certain conditions to be met - I need to be safe, I need to be treated with respect, etc. While I would leave if these needs of mine were to be dismissed, I would not stop loving him, although eventually I think the love would not be able to survive being mistreated.I love this question you've asked and I'm looking forward to reading others' responses. "
219,"I feel like I'm in lonely territory whenever I hear the love word, let alone try and determine the standards for defining conditional/unconditional love. Until recently, even the singular word love was enough to make me shiver and feel uncomfortable. I'm sure many here can relate without my spelling it out, but basically where I grew up the word existed but there were no honest living examples around me; the adults were all rank hypocrites in many respects, and love was one of their avoidant specialties. I had no idea what was meant by it, and became utterly afraid of hearing the word due to the fearful associations based on what I saw and experienced.In practice the FOO never uttered the actual word once, while for sure never displaying what I'd call love. Some duty was there--they fed and clothed me--but nothing beyond what they had to do to save face. My religious school abusers were worse, in that they actually used the word but in practice it was cruelly stained by their unsavory actions. So I'm in trouble trying to decipher anything about any form of love, but I've tried to 'catch up' anyway--something inside tells me it does exist in some form; I just never traveled in an honest enough environment to know what it was about. The media depictions mostly focused on various romantic twists and such, interesting but still confusing; more fantasy than reality.Plants and worms did wonder if it ""has to come from inside?"" To me it seems that yes, the inside realization about love were my only clues in trying to figure out what love consisted of. I've decided it's real but also very easily used as a code word to cover abuse of many types. When it's wrapped in religion it makes for a personal danger point, for instance, but it does seem 'spiritual' if one can get past those blocks. Sorry if I've dived into a bit of a rant, but I'll just close by noting there are several authors who've helped me see the promise of finding this inner unconditional love. One of the best at making any sense of love is the Vietnamese refugee Thich Nhat Hanh. Despite experiencing extreme persecution in his native country (he migrated to France where he currently lives), he's written several books focusing on love. He's identified as buddhist, but many of his writings are purely secular and are centered on love and peace as an everyday value and practice all humans deserve. There's many other writers these days, but his notions of love are inspiring and well presented--they make love seem very real. Still very hidden at times, but worth finding. "
220,"I comfess to not reading the posts before me.I came from a not perfect FOO, but certainly a more functional FOO than my other half - and that was what drew him to me.We have been together 25 years, and got married a few months ago on the 25th anniversary of our first date. We have been through an awful lot and his love for me is stronger now than it ever was. And that fact is what allowed me to have my meltdown and let out the terrified and raging little boy that has yet to be loved.But I am still loved, and that wonderfulness allows me to progress in my therapy.And he too recognises that therapy will be good for him.Two broken people loving and caring for each other. Far better than the pretence of romance that the regular press and magazines are full of."

222,"I have been feeling much better, had CBT courtesy of the NHS, joined an ACOA group etc.Thei scenario is triggering me though. My husband managed to get gig tickets for our daughter and her friend, plus me and the other mother. He paid, now he is asking if I have heard from the other mother regarding paying something. I did tell her that he would want the first half asap, which she said she would sort. Now the girls are back in school and he has to pay off the credit card soon he is asking if I have heard anything, he doesn't want to be supplying interest free credit for months.I find it really hard to ask for things, I find it hard to be in the middle between two others in a transaction or task. I find his methods of asking triggering but cannot explain this to him. The first time he asked if I had heard anything was just as I was trying to go to sleep, so that stopped me sleeping for a while. Any advice greatly appreciated.G"
223,"That sounds tough.   However I think it is actually your H who got you into a pickle, you didn't do it yourself. Really, it's his job to chase up on the money, not yours. I'm not sure how you would tell him though because I'm not good at that kind of stuff either. "
224,"Thanks Blueberry, I should have handed him the 'phone to talk to the other mum the day he bought the tickets. He does not have her contact details, nor has he asked for them.I have thought of a way out of my distress, I could pay him and let her pay me when she can as he is the one getting agitated. Not ideal, but you do what you have to do to get through, - something I read in an article on Medium.G"
225,I like your idea of paying him & dealing with the other mom yourself. Takes you out of the middle. 
226,"I have to admit I hate awkward situations like this Gromit, I think most of us here probably do.  What about just being straight with your H, tell him you feel really awkward and ask him to do so? "
227,"I met up with an old friend about a week ago out of nowhere and we had a great time.  He and I get along really well and have very similar senses of humor.  He comes from a foster home and has had to deal with all kinds of abandonment and abuse himself and it is also quite difficult for him to function at the same time, so we get each other in a deep way.  Seeing him though I realized how isolated I have been for the last couple years.  I had to move to North Carolina from Florida a couple years ago because I wasn't able to function down there and ended up in a situation where I was living out of my car and had to move to NC to live with my Mom to get back on my feet, although I'm not sure I've ever actually been on my feet to begin with.  I have a night job as a night auditor in a hotel which is great as far as stress goes, but I see very few people because of it.  I also uber on the side to make up for the low pay at the hotel, and this is actually helpful for me socially as I get to talk to people but not for too long.  But I realized I feel like I've been in a prison of fear for quite some time and I'm tired of it.  Although even if I'm around people as you guys know, it doesn't mean it's going to be easy or even possible for me to really open up and form deep relationships with people.  Not to mention the fact that I tend to attract emotionally unhealthy or dysfunctional people anyway, so I am always even more distrusting with people because of that.  I wish there was a cptsd support group face to face so we could be amongst each other and practice opening up emotionally little by little.  I don't know maybe I'll see about starting something like that in my area.  I am hopeful however because I've started to learn and practice effective communication techniques and assertiveness (why this isn't taught to children in schools I have no idea) and I think this will help me to be able to connect with people more.  "
228,"I know what you mean about unsafe people. I've had CBT which was great because the therapist seemed to totally get where I was coming from and the frustration from dealing with unsafe people. However, validation from someone who agrees with you does not always help deal with the unsafe people. Have you looked for an ACA or ACOA group in your area? It is for adult children of alcoholics or dysfunctional families. Sorry, I am assuming your CPTSD may be from childhood. The people in the group I attend are very welcoming, there is no wrong, people share as much or as little as feels OK and it is face to face. It would be great if assertiveness was taught in schools but I am not sure that all teachers or parents would be comfortable with the results.G"
229,"QuoteI wish there was a cptsd support group face to face so we could be amongst each other and practice opening up emotionally little by little.  I don't know maybe I'll see about starting something like that in my area. I agree ajvander, we do need a place (other than therapy) like a face-to-face group to connect directly with others in a safe environment.  As it happens one of our members Anna Bragga (not her forum name) just started a face-to-face group called the Survivors Hub in Bedford UK and the first meeting is tonight actually. She has a blog article about the group hereif you're interested.  I know Anna would probably be open to talking with you about starting a group of your own if you're interested in going ahead with that.  "
230,"I'm looking for an in person support group for CPTSD and haven't had much success to date. I feel like connecting in person really helps me. I attended a group last year via Meetup for a while but it closed down after a couple of months. Today I went to an AcoA meeting ( Adult Children of Alcoholics/Dysfuntional Families) https://adultchildren.org/ I was physically and emotionally abused by my parents, they weren't alcoholics but I wanted to try it out to see if it would be relevant. I'm not a natural '12 step person' as I'm not religious, but I went a lot to an eating disorder recovery one about 5 years ago which did help. Anyway, I wondered if anyone has any experience of ACA or anything else like it that might be useful?It can feel pretty lonely going through this alone, and I've found that in person groups can be really useful in grounding me. I'm not sure on the ACA group, but will try out a few meetings to see how it goes."
231,"I occasionally went to a 12 Step type support group for adult children of addicts of 'all kinds' - so parents who were workaholics, codependents, alcoholics, eating-disordered, love addicts, severely depressive: the works. I did feel quite well understood and found the Literature described my problems beyond my own addictive behaviour really quite well. Unfortunately there are no even faintly close meetings.Presumably ACoA is similar (I'm not in an English-speaking country, it's called something different here). Ime it's worth trying that kind of group out a few times just to see if it clicks. There's also something called SMART though I've never been and I don't know how trauma-informed it could be (or not). From another part of the forum: ""SMART Recovery (Self-Management And Recovery Training) is not a 12-step group, like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (NA).Our Approach* Teaches self-empowerment and self-reliance.* Encourages individuals to recover and live satisfying lives.* Teaches tools and techniques for self-directed change.* Meetings are educational and include open discussions.* Advocates the appropriate use of prescribed medications and psychological treatments.* Evolves as scientific knowledge of addiction recovery evolves.""Self-empowerment is certainly a good thing to develop when healing from cptsd. I think there is also a UK support group announced here somewhere on the forum, but I can't find it offhand. "

238,"Hi everyone, this is my first post.  I was wondering, what is your best piece of advice for having a good romantic relationship with CPTSD?    I was also wondering....How do you support your partner when they support you through trauma? How do you draw the line between not wearing them down with your pain, but also expressing yourself?How do you manage feelings of fear and mistrust if they trigger you?"
239,"Hi waterbuffalo It's hard work, communication and trust are essential to a good relationship, but these are usually highly problematic to the cptsd sufferer. I've worked out i need to keep showing my partner I love them with deeds, words, touch, etc (the 5 love languages is good at teaching some of this)  when my partner feels loved he is much more patient with me emotionally, and much less insecure. I often feel I shouldn't have to keep reassuring him but I understand my messed up brain gives off mixed messages Having more than one person you can talk too helps spread the load around. I don't know how to manage fear and mistrust I'm still working that out Good luck "
240,"HI and a warm welcome to OOTS WaterBuffalo     Here's a few things I'd suggest: Show your partner you love and respect them them, especially when there's conflict.  Times of conflict tend to be when we get stuck in fight, flight or freeze mode so we need to work at staying present and communicating.  (And it's just as important expect your partner to do the same.)  There's a good handout by Pete Walker called ""Tools for Lovingly Resolving Conflict"" you might find helpful.  Work together to understand what is Complex PTSD and how it affects you as individuals and a family. In other words, become a trauma informed couple/family.  There's an information sheet about that  here.  We all do better when we have multiple sources of support and different perspectives.  Coming here will hopefully be helpful for you and your partner may want to consider a group or counseling as well so he has a place to express himself and support from others who are partners.  You'll see on the handout for families about CPTSD there is an online group for partners run by Heather Tuba that might be something for him to consider.  Hope some of this is helpful    We ask all new members to have a read through our Member Guidelines so please take a moment to do so.  Tks!   "
241,"One of the big issues I am being forced to deal with now (and I do mean forced -- I hate dealing with emotions -- but it's affecting my sleep now) is emotionally trusting/connecting with others. Basically, trusting/believing on an emotional level that other people care about me. I can trust people in other ways. I can trust them to be my friends, to generally treat me well, to listen, etc. I can open up and tell safe people about my childhood issues, for instance. But that's because I view it intellectually: I am sharing data about myself with people that are willing to receive that data in a good way. I can understand on an intellectual, abstract level that my close friends and family do love me. But when it comes to putting my emotions on the line -- believing on an emotional level that someone truly cares about me -- I can't. Even thinking about it sets off lots of alarm bells and I end up in a rage or panic. My therapist has told me to work on calming my body down, figuring out what is tense and consciously telling it to relax, but this hasn't gotten me very far yet. I can relax, but as soon as I start to think about emotional trust I get panicked again.I know it's because of my childhood with my borderline mother. My mother was, depending on her mood, smothering, verbally abusive and critical, dependent on me to comfort her, infantilizing me and wanting me to be dependent on her, etc. The only way I had to protect myself was to shut off my emotions and my emotional attachments to whatever extent I could. I even remember making a conscious decision as a young child to not be emotionally attached to any of my toys. My therapist has asked if I remember what my relationship with my mom was like before I did that, but I can't remember. I suspect I shut down as soon as I possibly could.Has anyone else had a similar issue and made any progress with it?"
242,"Hello Finding My Voice,I’ve read your post quite a few times in the last couple days.  I just wanted to let you know that you are not alone in this.  I don’t really trust that anyone will be there for me on an emotional level either.  Sorry no advice... just sitting with you in this "
243,"I sometimes think I'm making progress with this. But then I find that thinking falls apart. There's an emotional undercurrent that never stops aching. I try mantras like 'you are loved' and such, along with various ways to meditate/contemplate and while I find them soothing, in the end all I am left with is the bald fact that I wasn't wanted, and never ever heard the words 'you are loved' or 'we/I love you' from so-called caregivers. This no longer puzzles me, it just infuriates. I mean we're talking 20+ years of that, mixed in with other abusive behaviours too creepy to relay, but within my own mind they smash in regardless.My only solution is to keep trying to find my own way. But know what? I'm so worn out with that and it seems so cheap, almost reinforcing their message of no one wants me, it's my own fault, etc. I've mountains of evidence of people I've touched in years since then, some rather deeply and some who did sincerely use the word 'love'. It seems nice but it always seems the memory gates swing back to block my emotional acceptance that there is such a thing as love that can be felt or is really a part of my destiny.Which leaves me frustrated and with no solid advice and/or confidence that I could even  suggest any way out of this dilemma. Whatever one tries saying, it all comes off sounding like platitudes and lame efforts to console what's inconsolable. Earlier I mentioned that sometimes I feel like I'm 'progressing' but it's a long haul, and can never fully patch what happened...so I kind of give up and it's odd to say but giving up sort of resets the system. I guess it could also be called surrender. Sorry if that sounds defeatist, though; I just have a hard time finding adequate language. That's how this seems to work--it's all like trying to re-invent life, even if just to make it through another day.Sorry if  "
244,"Yes very similar I also had a borderline mother and have serious emotional and trust issues.I have made a lot of progress but it needs to be very slow or I start dissociating again. if it's too overwhelming step back a bit and think of a smaller step to take that is easier to cope with. Little by little Sorry I can't be more help, "
245,"You know from what I've been reading about in regards to cptsd, toxic inner shame is a corner stone of the affliction.  Shame is a strange one for me because honestly for the longest time I was always sort of hazy on what exactly the word meant in relation to what I was feeling.  You know, like the actual feeling of shame itself, it took me a while to realize that I have been living in intense shame my whole life and didn't even realize it.  So being 'seen' by people and the intense fear of attack, rejection, ridicule etc I now believe was connected directly to having a bunch of shame come up for me or perhaps even an emotional flashback.  Maybe they are one in the same thing.  But recently I've been realizing that as I've avoided many social interactions and opening up over the years, combined with not knowing how to open up intimately with others or to fully express myself due to intense fear of a paralyzing emotional flashback popping up, that I am now over ashamed about being emotionally stunted.  You know, like on the inside I'm emotionally equivalent to a child and I try my hardest not to let anyone see it.  Can anyone relate to this as well?  I guess since we're sort of all in this together in this support forum with cptsd, I'll open up a bit with you all.  As a 31 year old male in relation to females, I find that I am attracted to them but there is also a need in general for the love and attention that I did not get from my mother in relation to them.  So like my interest in relationships with women is in part to try to indirectly get my emotional needs met. I'm realizing this more and becoming more aware of it, and so I hide that part of myself as much as I can too.  Honestly I avoid relationships like the plague because I don't want to be seen/I don't want to hurt anyone due to my emotional unavailability anyway, but a large part of my shame is feeling like I'm not really a 'man'.  In other words and to sum it all up, I guess you could say that I really feel like a big child emotionally.  I do desire that intimacy and connection with others, but there is also a neediness that is hard to stop if I open up those flood gates you know what I mean.  I know it's the fact that I never received any love or adoration from my mother at all, and while I'm working on getting my emotional needs met in healthy ways, how long is it going to take for me to age emotionally to catch up to what my actual age is?Honestly I really hate this cptsd garbage.  I don't know, maybe it happened for a reason.  Any thoughts on this particular subject would be appreciated, thanks everyone."
246,"Your post really resonated with me.I have adult onset cptsd which is slightly different.BUTI have a dear friend who has childhood cptsd due to the death of her mother and lack of nurturing from then on.She is probably my best friend in the world, but we don't see each other often.Neither of us knew we both had cptsd when we met many years ago. We support each other when we can.Childhood cptsd in my limited experience is exactly as you describe, there is a need to fill a nurture deficit void.I saw it in her as having a hole in your cup, no amount of kindness could fill the cup satisfactorily, and the perceived deficit causes distrust, pushing people away, passive aggressive behaviours.My friend has relationships with people who are bad for her, people who don't bother to try to nurture her or give kindness. Low self esteem allows her to accept mistreatment. But when people try to give her kindness it isn't sufficient anyway. She seems to reject it or not recognise it.I am not judging, she is one of the few people in real life who understands me, she is flawed but magnificent to me.Its the hole in the cup that needs repair. I just don't know how it can be done."
247,"I think the therapeutic term for this is 'arrested development'; where one's emotional roadmap was cut off at a certain point.I've known it well. Relationships? Needed 'em, sought 'em. At least I used to; my fear levels are so high now I tend not to even bother trying. But even when I sought them, I'd try not feel too needy or eager and show more of the side that indicated 'well, I don't want to seem too needy'; in fact, my neediness was almost desperate, but I was also scared to fully show it. So I'd defeat my own purpose, leave others wondering where I stood or if I truly cared, and hit the road back to the familiar place of abject loneliness. Awful in one sense, but it's how I'd learned to survive.It's almost worse to understand this, but at least it dampens false expectations. Meanwhile the only true fix I can relate to is re-orienting one's entire life. It's like having a brain injury and having to re-learn from the inside out, bottom up. It's like dropping a vase and either throwing it out or patching it together somehow; hoping for the best but highly unsure it'll work out.Disappointing? Sure. But it's what we have to deal with sometimes; and in some cases more than others. I guess the saying 'hang in there' applies. "
248,"how long will it take, aj?  hard saying.i think that the fact that you recognize it and are working on it is in your favor.  are you working with a therapist?  if so, and it's someone who understands such emotional stunting, i would guess that you'll get there sooner rather than later.best to you with this.    if you want it,"
249,"@woodsgnomeYeah it does feel like everything is broken and has to be rebuilt from the ground up, from scratch.  Not only that, but with little to no help from others, and many times trying to do it blind folded or in the dark.  I've rebuilt a lot of myself and in doing so it gave me a very intricate and in depth understanding of my self and 'the' self at the same time, for which I am grateful.   But if I had a choice to go through all of this over again I wouldn't do it.  "
250,"@sanmagic7You know I've worked with many therapists of varying degrees in the past, but none of them were worth a damn, and I mean it.  The truth is at this stage in the game and in both having cptsd and learning methods of coping/healing from it I have gone way beyond what the vast majority of therapists are capable of or even taught in schools.  It's a shame, it shouldn't be that way.  Maybe it's time for a psycho/emotional revolution in the mental health field.  So I'm currently not seeing a therapist but after reading Pete Walkers work about finding a 'good enough' therapist specifically for relational healing and one who understands trauma and cptsd, I am interested in ultimately finding a good enough relational therapist.  At the moment I have very little money and no insurance and no time to go traipsing around creation hunting for a therapist who actually knows what they're doing lol.  But I'll get there eventually I imagine.  Maybe I'll share some of the things that have been a great help to me in healing and managing my cptsd here at some point."
251,"@ajvander86 Actually what you describe sounds like familiar behaviour, in that, as a female, I have experienced this in men. For me it is promising that you recognise it & are sharing that. Men I have been involved with tend to hide their neediness, it comes out as anger when I do something they don't want me to, showing I am independent. Whereas, it would be gratifying to know that someone needed you, without that aggression, playing 'hard to get' as if you are not needy gives the impression you do not care. G"
252,"I remember reading a psychology article in regards to childhood and teenage abuse; usually, your emotional maturity will become stunted during the time when you've experienced the most trauma in your younger life.For me, this time was during my teens. I was sexually abused when I was much younger, but I suffered prolonged, sexual, emotional, and verbal abuse during my junior high and high school years through a step parent and eventually my own mother. Therefore, I struggle a lot with my emotional regulation--which can sometimes be very reminiscent of how a teenage girl would process reality around her.These things have gotten better with lots of diligence and labor on my part; we're talking years of never giving up and forcing myself past some towering, old barriers that I never thought I'd be able to overcome.Emotional regulation is a dimension of cPTSD that many sufferers battle; and depending on when your traumas happened, I imagine regulating certain emotions can be especially difficult and many people might not fully grasp why. I've been judged by people for being immature in my emotions and talked down to for them. However, this is just an example of them having little sympathy; they don't understand, even though their distress over my past episodes is very understandable. You just don't speak to people that way. It's unhelpful and harmful.One other thing that I think happens with this dilemma, and whether it's a residual effect or what causes the emotional regulation issues I think is moot, is this aspect: a lack of sense of self. From what I can tell you from my own experience, OP, figuring out my emotions had to be supplemented with building up my identity that I had been robbed of by my abusers. After my mother died back in 2014, I realized I didn't know who I was after I lost her. I had been so deeply enmeshed into who she was and her own life that on my own, I felt like no one. I didn't feel like I had any value without her. That's what abuse, narcissism, and enmeshment can do to a victim.So it's been a process, and I hope that you will give yourself the time, patience, compassion, and consideration as you go through your journey. Best wishes."

254,"I'm back again. Yesterday was strange, and I realized something about myself.Yesterday evening, I was outside and was stung by a wasp. I am not allergic to wasps, and I am medically trained, so I treated the sting, took a Benadryl and followed my protocol for my being alone. I wrote on the calendar the date and time and that I was stung by a wasp. I left the Benadryl on the counter and I left a friend I trusted a message of what I had done and that I was fine. I then sat down to watch the news, and I had my land line telephone by my side.I dozed off a bit, as I was tired, and then all of a sudden I heard yelling outside my house and pounding on one of my doors. I got up wondering what was going on. It was my sister, and she came around to my deck. She yelled that she had been called and told I was stung by a bee. Then suddenly, all the aggression that has been held up within me boiled to the surface. Despite she is my sister, and my brother died a bit over a week ago, I told her that I was okay and told her to go home. Of all people in the world I would not wish to be around me if I needed help, that person is my sister. I do not trust her in any way, shape or form. And I wondered how she would know I got stung. I was actually angry, and the adrenaline was flowing through me. So I checked messages, then my cell phone started ringing so much it nearly fell off the nightstand. The people started showing up. I could not get my computer to respond to send a message I was okay. And my cell phone battery lost its charge before I could check who called.I did let my cousin, who was called by a friend, come in to talk. I shook my head in disbelief about all that transpired. I was to blame. I trusted someone, and they panicked. Normally, I would have laughed it off, but seeing my sister, having her walk to come into my house. That set me off, because now with my brother having died, I had no one to protect by telling my sister what I thought. She had a stunned look on her face, but I did not want her in my house. I do not trust my sister at all.People were worried, and I spent hours telling people I was okay. My cousin only lives a few miles away, and she thought it was funny. She realizes and understands about my sister. So that was not a problem. And I still can't figure out how my sister found out. She gave a name of someone who called her, but I have not a clue as to who that may be. I am wondering if my sister has somehow figured out how to access my email and messaging.I explained to the friend I had told that to call me, use my land line. I'm in the phone book. But she got so worried. So now I wonder if she will ever talk to me again. I wish no one ever goes through what I have experienced as the result of having a sister like I have. And I hope that one day people will understand why I act like I do with my sister. My Mom told me flat out that my sister is a Narcissist. Both parents and my brother told me to never trust my sister. And it is difficult for me to understand why other people cannot see that.So I am reviewing my protocols in the event something happens to me. I live alone on a very big place. Yet I have always been on the alert in regard to my sister. I often am outside, and catch her staring at me across the road while she is hiding behind a bush. I am very cautious where I live. What bother's me though is my aggression came out last night towards my sister. I figured that my sister cannot harm my brother anymore and use that against me if I fight her and don't follow her commands. And I have been No Contact with her for years, and have let her know and let her kids know. My sister tells her kids that I want to be left alone by everyone. That is not true, I only do not want to see my sister. My Mom said it many times, she said to me that my sister is pure evil. I didn't accept it until my Mom got injured. Then I understood clearly.I don't know if my friend will ever talk to me again. I told her to never call my sister and to use my land line. And that I do take precautions in the event of something like that happening to me. I didn't tell anyone that my concern would be that if I was down and out, I would not put it past my sister for finishing me off. That is my own concern from what I have witnessed my sister and her actions over the years.AncientSoul"
255,"Hi AncientSoul,I am glad you are ok, and that the wasp sting didn't cause you any allergic reaction - you handled that situation so well - but it was a pity that it all got a bit out of hand, with someone phoning your sister.  I can imagine how upsetting that must have been for you to see her - and for her to try to come into your home.  You handled it well.  Having anger within you - that's understandable too.  You mentioned how your parents told you to be careful of your sister, as she was 'pure evil' - I also have a sister (but have had minimal contact with her) but one thing she did say to me consistently was that she perceives my FOO (parents) are 'pure evil' - and my M is probably a narcissist - and the thing is that hearing that - it can be hard sometimes to 'take it in', but it's actually fairly solid warnings - for someone to feel that way.  to you AncientSoul, and I hope you're able to work out something to help you to feel safer in your home.When you described your sister hiding behind a bush - near your property - being so close, that's not good.  I don't know what to suggest, except that I hope you are able to find out something that will help to keep boundaries and keep you safe.Hope  "
256,"With my brother dying last week, then hearing my friend and almost adopted brother has about one good year left before he can't do anything. This has been a tough week and weekend.Now my sister and her kids are starting in on me. Since my sister no longer has my brother (and his retirement checks), more attention seems to be placed upon me by my sister and her kids. I expect that, but I fear it will not stop. I realize I will have to have some contact with my sister, but have learned in the past to be vary careful and to expect anything.Then a former girlfriend from the 90's got in touch with me. She broke up with me when my mother got sick and I became caregiver. Then when my mother died, that former girlfriend told me ""Since your Mom is dead, we can be together again."" Sorry, but if tough times hit and someone bails, they will do that again. I would rather be alone.My sister always seems to offer things that are not hers. She's done that for as long as I can remember. She see's something and will claim it is hers. Or she will see something and ask, ""Can I have that?"" or ""Will you buy that for me?"" I turn the other way and run. But for years now, I won't even speak with her. It is pointless. I'm never right and I get accused of many things that I know nothing about.Today, I'm thinking its all me, that I'm the cause. I stay out of peoples way and try to help. The stress to me if very real. Then more stress when my sister tries to communicate with me. If I respond in any way to my sister, then more and more things will follow. It will escalate until she has total control. I will not allow that to happen ever again.  I keep hearing from professionals. ""Sell and run.""I will need to be available for my friend for another year or two. That's about all the time he may have. AncientSoul"
257,"  I am unsure as to if I could have such as the worst experience I have had in my almost 45 years was work related, I would like to know if it is possible I could have this?.  I started working at a popular, well known university at 23, just before I left the military (reserve), I had throughout my time there had many friendly acquaintances, even a few close friends in my 21 years there  (or so I thought) and only 10 people within that time did I ever have a serious problem with.  About 5 years ago I lost my supervisor to a major heart attack and a newer guy within the group became our acting supervisor and during which time the group functioned with only 4 of 6 persons and we were over-worked but happy due to the acting's leadership, I personally felt He was the better of the supervisors....    After a few months we all as a group voted Him to become our primary supervisor which did happen and I thought things could not get any better.  After 8 months however, He began calling me a liar about things I would answer Him with like location, which I was always where I said I was and always doing as I said I was, but He refused to believe this, then He began putting me on unfair, unreasonable disciplines to single me out which began to not only anger me but causing me to become paranoid and distrustful of Him first then the rest of the group, next I learn after nearly 2 years of this treatment the manager of the dept., the h.r. liaison supervisor, and His chosen lackey were trying to get me to quit.  With my time at this university I could not just 'quit' so I chose to stick it out and hope that it would soon end, to no avail....  I began recording this person and His followers only to luck out and get Him saying : ...I wanted you moved since day 1...., 3 years now after day 1, plus other co-workers were being verbally punished for assisting me in situations I needed help, yet never for aiding others within this group.  I began the grievance policy with my recordings and write-ups that made absolutely no sense other than severe bullying usage to get me to quit which again, failed for me.   I was now experiencing numbness in my body consistantly, along with light-headedness/dizzynes, consistantly having unusual pain all over, near blackouts sometimes at the most inopportune times, extreme depression and severe anxiety (learned this almost a year later), my paranoia became so bad I feared leaving the house for anything, consistently being angry, morbid, or even infuriated when near these person/s and/or heading into or preparing to leave the jobsite, and all I could think about were those persons and situations I was dealing with and what I could do to somehow get away from them, legal and sometimes even illegal thoughts that I refused to give into no matter the temptation, and even thought I was having a heart attack once, but after 6 hours in the e.r. there were no signs or reasons to believe that was the case.  After neary 2 more  years of even worse treatment from these ignorant yet diabolical and deranged persons with only 7 years left to retire they found a suspicious way of firing me without giving me the reason, then fighting me with unemployment and losing the first time with their so-called reason, then changing from not doing my job which unemployment investigated and found there was no facts leading to such, to insubordination which could not be proved yet as big company's go, they won that time.  I fought through all the red tape and suffered through their grievance policy and reached stage three, their highest, very few get that far, but then they changed the rules at stage 3 and discounted my 1-2 form and stated I could only talk about the reason for being fired which I still did not know even to this day, and the vp of equality was requested by me to speak to 2 women who overheard a discussion/degrading chat my supervisor gave to me and their statment being: the way He spoke to you made us really uncomfortable.  After the investigation She claimed She could not look into this as it did not fall under Her job, yet after my situation with Her She quickly 'retired', again I went to h.r. and they declined to look further into this matter, and finally after 8 1/2 months of fighting these 'people', I had to admit defeat for my family and me.  I currently am still hypersensitive of any situations that are remotely close to those 5 years I dealt with this, my family and friends suffers from my mentality and vivid recollection of the things I was dealing with along with the years of anger and hatred of being consistently set up for failure by those I aformentioned earlier and I have lost interest in almost everything I once was, wanted to be, and even could be or do, I feel I am now an indifferent, argumentative, and extremely paranoid individual that feels little happiness and fear trying to make friendships with anyone as they will always find a way to backstab me in the end, I tend to stay miserable, edgy, and even infuriated at the smallest things that never used to bother me, my focus on anything suffers greatly, very little memory capability and even less capability to learn new things and is terribly difficult to function in a job, although I am apparently surviving it for the moment but has only been almost 3 months since I started and already am becoming somewhat like I was before.  Could this be CPTSD?  "
258,"Hello everyone,  I've wanted to make this post for a little while now. I'm gaining more awareness of the fact that I feel quite physically vulnerable and like a bit of a sitting duck.  For a while now I've tried telling myself the same things that Pete Walker suggests in his Flashback Management Steps, that I'm in an adult body now and can better protect myself... but no matter how much I tried to tell myself that, I can't believe I'm physically safer now than I was then.*Slight TW, for physical abuse*Actually, as I'm writing this I realise that when I was a child I was powerless to stop myself from being dragged about, but as an adult I'm not guaranteed to be physically helpless in the same way.  So that's good, if I can hold onto it - struggling with dissociation/flight/critic a lot at the moment, makes that difficult. But if I've got it written here then I can come back to it.  Though it's not enough.Anyway, I'm a mostly freeze/dissocation type, and assertiveness seems to be a common and particular issue for people like me.  I have wanted to learn self-defense since I was very young, to protect myself and my family, and I keep wondering if that would help me learn to be assertive (in a healthy way) and further my recovery. I've heard people saying that it has brought up strong emotions that were difficult to deal with for some people, so it might be a bit tough.I'm interested in hearing what other people here have experienced regarding assertiveness, what your journeys with it are like, what you've learned about it, and what has or hasn't helped you. Thank you!  "
259,"I think that's a great thing to be aware of and good insight on your part to choose assertiveness as something you'd like to develop.I'm also coming to realize that I tend to freeze/dissociate, and assertiveness has always been tough for me. I was raised in an environment where advocating for my needs led to being hurt in a variety of ways...somewhere along the line, I convinced myself I don't have needs. It helped me get through childhood, but all that continued self-denial in adulthood has been damaging.The first thing that's helped me develop assertiveness is shrinking the inner critic and cultivating compassion through meditation. It's helped me see that under all my defenses and issues, there is a person worth saving and protecting. From a place of self-love, I've been working on identifying what my needs are because sometimes I'm not even aware of what i want or need. Then, if i can manage, I try to express what i want or need...i'm still not great at it, but theres a DBT skill called DEAR MAN which helps me a lot. Its basically an assertiveness script that you can use in any occasion. I recommend you google it if you're interested!Best of luck in your journey, may we both grow to be more assertive "
260,"Thanks saturnine, interesting to hear how you've started with developing assertiveness. I think I can recall reading that shrinking the inner critic and somehow angering are both important to gaining our self-protectiveness. I've had a little look at the DBT DEAR MAN thing, seems helpful! Thanks for the tip.  And yes, here's to being more assertive."
261,"Assertiveness has been huge for me. I have viewed it as an ongoing project for over 4 years and refer to it as assertiveness training. It is a process, for sure. My biggest tools have been the following:- Learning by heart and stating to myself “my feelings are important too”.- Taking the time I need to check in with how I feel, and using phrases such as “hmm I’m not sure right now. Can I get back to you about that later?” And “I need a minute to think”.- Noticing that there are some people who can hear my little voice of assertiveness (I don’t want to shout or have conflict to have my voice heard) and some who can’t. Removing myself where possible from those who just can’t hear it.- If I am forced to W have with someone who has a big voice and can’t hear my little voice, I have to get  v e r y  c l e a r  about what I am saying and make sure I check in with myself and make my voice heard. - being prepared for a backlash as a result of asserting myself, for instance people who are not used to me having a voice being rude or minimising about my thoughts and feelings. - having a plan of action in the face of a backlash, for instance “no, I am not being [insert insult] and it is out of line of you to call me that. These are my feelings and they still stand.”- Having resources to fall on when I struggle to hear my own voice or feel uncertain. These include journaling, listing, speaking to objective ‘listeners’ (blahtherapy.com is good) and certain friends who are helpful at reflecting, reading to help me understand more about my feelings, taking time, allowing uncomfortable feelings to present and trying to adjust to these (anger is very uncomfortable for me, as it was repressed for a long time when I had no control as a child, but with practice I can feel it or access it more quickly now).I wonder - what does the assertiveness you seek look like to you? If you visualise the assertive person you want to step into being, what do they look like? How do they behave? What measures do they take? What do they say and how do they say it?  "
262,"I like your way of viewing it as an ongoing project and referring to it as training, Sasha.  Sounds like it makes it okay when things the critic would view as 'mistakes/errors' happen.  Congrats for tackling it! Quote from: Sasha on July 20, 2018, 11:35:39 PM- Learning by heart and stating to myself “my feelings are important too”.- Taking the time I need to check in with how I feel, and using phrases such as “hmm I’m not sure right now. Can I get back to you about that later?” And “I need a minute to think”.I think I could definitely take baby steps at practicing those two tools.  The first one, that our feelings are important too, is easy to forget with CPTSD, but I'm getting a bit better at listening to myself!  And those ways of giving yourself permission to step back from something and take your time are great tools to have on hand, too.  Quote from: Sasha on July 20, 2018, 11:35:39 PMI wonder - what does the assertiveness you seek look like to you? If you visualise the assertive person you want to step into being, what do they look like? How do they behave? What measures do they take? What do they say and how do they say it?  That's an excellent question that makes me realise I'm not sure I know what my assertiveness would look like... although I think, interestingly, that in the past my imagined assertive me was reminiscent of my F, the only (and most) assertive person I knew.  A lot of food for thought with those questions, thank you Sasha.  They present a different way of thinking that's helpful to take my concept of assertiveness from a vague notion of being able to stand up for myself, to a fleshed out goal of where I want to head in interpersonal dealings."
263,"I am not quite sure under which board I should place this. It fits here, in my journal, in ""just a difficult day"", progress, set back... The lot! But mainly, it has to do with my relationship with others. Primarily my parents, or rather - my mother. (This is a bit long, I'm sorry. But it was just alot, and trying to avoid writing many threads)It was the opening of the gallery show today. I've been waiting quite a long time for it, and for a time I forgot it was happening because it always seemed to happen in the next few months. But it was today. It isn't my first art exhibition where I participate, it's the 6th. But it is the first one which is not affiliated with a school or course work. This was all on my own. I sent it in to be judged, and the jury accepted both my entrees. I had invited my dad to come, and he had by definition invited my mom to come too. They both were excited. I invited a few others too, but they had declined - they couldn't make it today - when I invited them. Half an hour before the opening I call my mom, asking if what their plan was. She said she didn't have any plan. So I asked if she wasn't coming. To which she replied she'd forgotten. She didn't realize it was today. Eventhough I reminded her just a few days ago. I felt dissapointed, and I felt I shouldn't be. This is unusual for her, to dismiss me like this. She did sound earnest while expressing regret. I suppose it's why it hurt more. My father was stuck at work away from the city - the transport had been delayed a day. He was supposed to return yesterday ( it was out of his control).  While I was talking on the phone I got a text message from my roommate, he'd lost track of time and wasn't able to make it either. I felt alone. Unimportant. Like I wasn't important enough to write it down in their schedule or put on alarm. I'm not in alot of contact with my emotions these days, so the hurt was muted. But it activated my anxiety. I had to go face these people alone. These unknown people, other artists, go into a room... What did I have to say? Nothing. What if no one came? The last one wasn't a problem at all. I was standing a few doors down from the gallery door, collecting myself before daring to walk over. I was a few minutes late, but figured the speech would be a few minutes after opening too. I was wrong, but mainly because the gallery was PACKED. I couldn't get in the door before after the speech. So I didn't get to listen in to the speech. I got social anxiety, and being in a small room full of people I have no knowledge of, with only one exit.. It's nightmareish for me. But I did it. I walked in, I had told them I'd be there - so I felt obligated. I couldn't walk back on my word. And who do I see there? A former/current/unknwon status friend. The one who I wrote about in another thread (the tent-stealing friend - for those who read about that). She saw me and rescued me in my bewliderment for a brief moment. I am apprechiative of that. I talked to a few of the staff, because they approached me. I was so full of anxiety I wasn't able to ask them good or interessting questions, or come with things to say at all. It was alot. I only stayed for 30 minutes. I couldn't last longer. I just, it was too much. And I was too alone. I was too anxious. I did actually pat myself on the shoulder for walking in the door. But I feel no accomplishment. None. I feel nothing. Just weariness. My dad called me two hours later, saying he was sorry he missed it, but he couldn't do anything about the transportation. He would like to see it though, before it's gone. Thank you all for reading through all of this. I know it's long. "

265,"Hey,I remember your tent stealing friend, she is a self proclaimed narcissist?She didn't rescue you, you are a catch, an exhibiting artist, good to be around.You got your art accepted, you turned up and it was rammed with people viewing your work.Be proud of your work, be proud that you attended alone and did something difficult.Just be proud of yourself and your work."
266,I know how hard the pressure of wanting to impress is and how hard it is to trust people sometimes.   
267,"Thank you blueberry, for the hugs!   They mean alot. @Rainagain, She has called herself a narcissist - though I am uncertain still whether she was jesting or not. She's been through alot, and she might have said it because she felt selfish by taking up so much more space than she is used to. But it might also be true. I can't know with certainty.  But it felt nice seeing her again. And thank you for your warm words, they mean alot. they really do. I will try to be proud, but it is a difficult thing to do. @Rocket, It can be an overwhelming pressure, and such a deep hurt when I don't live up to the expectations. Thank you for the hugs!  "
268,"I'd advise being very cautious of your 'friend' - had one similar who called themselves an undiagnosed PD, turned out they weren't joking and enjoyed flaunting the truth of who they were right in peoples faces without anyone believing them.I really wanted to say WELL DONE!!     To walk into a room like that, feeling the way you did, that's a big deal!   Good job you. Things like that are scary.Not having people you care about show up to view your work is disheartening, even if they have understandable reasons. <3 I've been a smaller version of that boat."
269,"I haven't talked to my ""friend"" since the opening. And you're right, I will be very careful if she reaches out again. I'll keep an emotional distance from her. And also, thank you, Erebor! It means alot to be validated that it was a big thing to walk in when feeling as I did. I still feel a little sad when thinking about the absence of my family. "
270,"If it's acceptable, I shall send you a hug!   "

272,"I wasn't brought up religious.  My mother had had brain cancer when she was 19 and decided at that time that she didn't believe in God because God would not have allowed her to become so ill.  Her father was a Jehovah's Witness for a while.  During his last years of life he was a member of the World Wide Church of God, which was later deemed a cult, from what I understand.  My father's side of the family was not religious either, as far as I know.  I do remember one of his sisters would occasionally take my cousins to church, but usually only on Easter or at Christmas.  I took a course on world religions in college.  My mother was upset about it and asked angrily if it meant I was going to be a ""Holy Roller"" from then on.  I also took a Bible as literature course, but didn't learn much from it.  As I've gotten older, I've started to believe more and more that there is something larger out there.  I have a number of friends who are Christians, so I'm able to talk to them some about spirituality.  I took what's called an Alpha Course at a local church.  The course was supposed to be an introduction to the Christian church for outsiders with questions.  Most of the people in the course were church members who were maybe trying to reaffirm their beliefs.  The course was taught with an assumption of belief in God. For instance, a question for discussion was, ""How do you exhibit your Christianity at work?""  Um...slow down there...  It was tough to fit in there.And that's where I'm going with this.  I feel like I want more, but I'm not sure how to fit in or even gain access so that I may someday fit in.  I've told my friends it feels like there's this secret club and everyone in it uses special language and knows all the inside stories and I'm on the outside feeling lost.  I feel like the wallflower at the dance who would like to join in, but doesn't even know how to get herself onto the dance floor.I'm not sure what I'm looking for.  I think I'd like to be in a small group of people who read through the bible and learn together, but I don't know when those classes start, etc.  When and how do I jump on board?Anyhow, last night I was thinking about emailing the pastor at a church near my house just to ask these things and introduce myself because just showing up at church on Sunday morning never did much to help orient me.  As I was thinking about this and what I might say, I heard my name being shouted sharply inside my head.  I couldn't tell if it was my mother's or my father's voice shouting at me.  Wow.  Talk about an introject.  It was clear ""they"" didn't want me to go down this path.  Interesting.  What else are they keeping me away from that could be enriching my life?"
273,"Hello Kat, I too am quite confused about God and religion. When I was with my M and step F we would occasionally go to church for F's family. It never meant anything to them. The same old same old always happened. They just kind of faked their belief. Outsiders thought they were good church goers, ignoring anything off about us. Now here with my real F it's a lot different. He and his parents, well my whole family, is very religious and I feel as if I kind of get frowned upon for not believing. And its not like I don't believe, I just don't know what I believe. So there are others out there with you. MR"
274,"Thanks for sharing your confusion.  That might sound silly, but I mean it in the best way.  It helps to know I'm not the only one."
275,"I was brought up by an atheist and a Christian of a standard protestant denomination, who didn't/doesn't believe in some important parts of the religion e.g. forgiveness. I personally have a lot of troubling with forgiving, and I don't mean just FOO here, but I'm not opposed to it. But my Christian upbringer is. One set of grandparents also Christian and one atheist. Religion seemed to be a reason for them to 'have a go' at each other about their beliefs/non-belief via the grandchildren especially via me.  I went to church sometimes as a child but don't feel I learned much of what it was about. Especially all that weird language nobody ever explained: ""for I am a jealous god"" (thought jealousy was a sin), ""to judge the quick and the dead"" (what on earth is quick?? - how are you meant to understand antiquated language as an 8 year old?)   I was meant to go to keep my M company.   I go alone all the time as an adult and have no problem with that. I've come to some form of belief as an adult. I started going to church when I was physically unwell for a number of months. I don't believe everything that is said or meant to be believed but going does me good. It's as simple as that. I don't go every week but have phases where I go very regularly. I've had a few experiences with various forms of prayer, not just Christian, which came to me out of the blue when I was in a really bad way. Sometimes I talk about things I don't understand with friends who are practising Christians, i read the prayer book when sitting in church waiting for the service to begin, which is sometimes quite illuminating, and the priest uses the sermons to explain rather than exhort or harangue. That's enough for me, I let my belief develop as it develops. I'm not into attempting to rush that. "
276,"Speaking only for me, personally, i feel like a relationship with a creative, loving deity is the only reason I'm still alive. I was quite self destructive until I formed this relationship at age 25. I like the phrase in AA/12 step literature, ""...God as you understand him."" (Or, her.) If God is an infinite being, then we who are finite cannot fully understand all that he is. I'm okay with that. I do admit tho on bad days i can't relate to him as a father figure or a brother. On those days i like to think of God as a spirit only, or I choose to relate to a more female interpretation of God. It makes me livid that humans have perverted the name of pure love to suit their own twisted agenda. "
277,"Thank you for your responses.  It's nice to hear from others and to know that there are various ways to go about this.  I sent that email.  It felt like a rather strange thing to be doing, but I also know that I need some guidance from somewhere.  As I said, just showing up on a Sunday or a few Sundays did little to help me gain access.  I haven't gotten a response yet.  We'll see what happens.I once told my T that I wished there was a place I could go at the end of the work week where I could sit down with friends and share a meal, sing some songs, hear stories told, give support to others and gain support, and form plans to make things better in others' lives and in the community.  She's a devout Christian and nodded through what I said.  And then I said that I realized what I was describing is church, but that my few experiences of church weren't much like what I was yearning for.  She agreed.  "
278,"Uh-oh. This topic is a virtual mine field that touches my core being, involves my entire life story  and is very triggering, but I'll try and ferret out something.My cptsd revolved around religion; I started life surrounded by abuse shrouded within a religious milieu. The FOO was bad enough; teachers at religious schools reinforced the pain and took it to new heights. I now can recognize them as extreme hypocrites whose behaviours  didn't match their supposed message, which was mostly just a socially acceptable cover for their abysmal abuses. They were crafty, though; hiding themselves within a sub-group of a major denomination.Bad as they were, I still retained some sense that there's more to religion/spirituality than their horrid example was.. My reference to them became a sort of role model reverse--I knew from them how NOT to live life hiding behind hypocrisy (and using kids as a foil for their spiritual b****).Where am I now? Probably more spiritual than I would have thought, given that start. Spiritual to me means all of life--how it's lived, not just an intellectual doctrine or creed/theology, but a heartfelt expression of values. It's taken a long time, but I now have a better handle on the meaning of love and peace than 12 years of religious schools ever taught. It's like I've bent their perverted use of religion back to its essence.Trying to find the original messages is like trying to remove layers of canvas painted over the first panel. Language especially becomes rusty, and at some point it's like using a product beyond its due date; it goes sour. And...means nothing.The only sure guide is one's own heart. Do the actions match the messages? Do they acknowledge imperfection? Are their scriptures, if any, used as guidelines or inspiration; or are they forced on people, contradictions included? Seems like many just accept their words as if they do have some secret, but if it involves throwing one's own life away, the secret is pretty lame.As I feared, I'm stretching up against my intent to be brief. Suffice to say that after decades of independent study, I've gone through several phases (see spiritual bypass discussion in religious abuse section of this forum) and have cleared out a comfort zone which is based on several wisdom traditions--think inter-spiritual instead of inter-religion; as the spiritual, for me, acts more as a pointer to what feels right regardless of specific doctrines or belief systems.What it comes down to, for me--everything in life is spiritual no matter the doctrines that may or may not feel comfortable. How I 'be' my life is more important than how I 'do' it...values like love and peace, sure; but they better mean something, not just be nice words. Who decides? My heart.When it comes to how to find a good fit, the idea of talking directly to clergy people might work, but it's like finding a good therapist--be careful if they venture into rote doctrinal talk in lieu of the values they express by whatever religious rites they may espouse. It's more about the feel than the doctrine; beware of secret ways and all that chummy clubbiness so many seem to hide behind (my abusers were masters at that disguise). This probably makes me sound like some rank atheist, and I thought so myself for long periods. But I 've found it's a matter of finding someone with heart language I can relate to, whether it's 'churchy' or not. Then if they have a God message it may or might not make sense to what my heart longs for. Religion is another of those nice-seeming options for a way to live, but has its limitations especially if the wrong people seize its original tone. It's kind of like anything else--certain religions should come with an expiration date stamped on its carton.Sorry for this post's length--it's a topic that hits me square on. A fair read some might be interested in is Alain de Botton's Religion for Atheists: A Non-Believers Guide to the Uses of Religion; it takes an approach that religion has value, but it takes a bit of probing to find it; hidden, as I tried to discuss above."

280,"i was raised christian, various religions, but as i got older i realized i never felt a spiritual connection.  i, too, found it at an AA meeting, and it was nothing like what i'd been taught in church. as the years went by, i tried on several different approaches to spirituality.  none of them quite fit for me, mainly because i wasn't of that ethnic background.  then i remembered a plaque on my wall growing up.  it was a picture of a kitten and read 'god is love'.that stuck with me.  i could understand love, and connect it to a spirit.  to me, then, god became intangible, neither male nor female,but pure spirit.  and i'm able to see that spirit everywhere i go, so it doesn't have to be housed in a building for me.it's been a trial and error pursuit of a 'higher power' for me, and it sounds like that's what you're doing as well, kat.  i think the concept of god is so very individual and personal that we can only come by it when we're ready.  then, it will be there.   taking a look around, trying to find your place re: the spirituality that you seek will continue to be a learning experience for you until you feel comfortable at last.good for you for reaching out.   you'll find your fit eventually, of that i have no doubt.  big hug."
281,"The God-factor: Been down that road too, got to a point I felt it was a stressed belief got reassured when the Branch Davidians' did their little revolt in Waco and set the place on fire. I thought am I in a cult? Had to step back and look at me again. I was exposed to religion off and on throughout my early life, and thought that I was going to burn in * if I did not do the right thing, so guilt and shame was in great abundance. It felt like I could never live up the that so called goodness that others had or at least they made me think they have. Seen a lot of double standards, shallowness, twisted points of view and a sense of their righteous conviction of my life and what I was supposed to be. I had one person say to me that I had the gift of giving and they had the gift of receiving, how convenient that I am that persons new go to guy for what he needs or wants. If someone needs a favor just ask, but learn to accept if I say no. Many of other things happened to support my feelings of doubt and so I slipped away and have not been back since, I did take with me some of the values that I thought were of helpful to my life and still use them today. If someone seeks out, they may find that there is something that they can use to improve their life and I do not want to be a nay sayer because of my situation, questions are good even if we do not like the answer we get.

287,"I used to think losing hope and losing faith in people would be crushing, that nothing would lie beyond it. I'd be like a dead scorched desert. But some terrible things have happened to me in the past few months that were worse than previous experiences, and I gave up. I'm not well to put it mildly, but I survived. It's not a good thing to survive this sort of thing I guess, but my opinion wasn't required. And it doesn't matter. It wasn't earth shattering for me personally either, it was banal. I guess I realized I was naive and eventually stopped wishing, hoping, dreaming, fantasizing, asking, imagining. It strengthened a sort of split in me, where there's a part of me that responds the second it recognizes someone else's pain, that cares deeply about others' pain. But that's where it ends. I guess I'm not sure I think much of it, which is ironically the point too. So I don't see any point in trying hard to change my emotions. But I wanted to ask what others thought. (It's the old split again... I don't see why my situation matters, but I see why yours does, and why your thoughts do.)"
288,"For me that split is seeing myself as an object and others as subject.  An inversion of narcissism and no less crazy.  It's about not experiencing life, the world, other people as through my self*, which exaggerates others' importance in my mind and minimises my own.I don't know if anyone else can identify with this.  It took experiencing differently to even see what the problem was.I feel the solution for me is trauma body work of different kinds - putting myself back in my body, at the centre of experience, as per the reality of all experience, imo.I was also badly hurt by other people and a magnet for toxic people of all kinds.  it makes sense.  I was pre-objectified, that's like being signed sealed and delivered for exploiters.  It would have stood out a mile.You do matter Ah.  I have found it necessary to do everything I can to teach myself to matter deeply to myself.*precognitive self, not 'identity'.edit to add - for me ""giving up"" was an important first step in finding solutions - I no longer had a scrap of hope that this way of being led to anywhere other than *."
289,"Ah wrote: ""I don't see any point in trying hard to change my emotions.""Maybe if there was this point, it would only satisfy the old nagging egoic voice, encouraged by the snarly inner critic, that there's something wrong with your outlook. It's not that you lack compassion for yourself or lack what you feel for others, but as you've repeatedly learned there are many abusers incapable of receiving the compassion you bring. Any hope and/or faith placed in them has already been betrayed. It was there, your gift for them to claim, but they've turned it back. In that way turning from their falseness was only natural on your part. They haven't demonstrated that they understand this, and sadly have crossed into pleasing their egos and losing you.Even without hope, there's still this candle we each carry within. We wanted to share it, and sometimes our compassion can't help but show our caring. This isn't anything to be regarded as hopeful, it's just there. But if others can't see it, there's also nothing you can do to counter them, but just live as best you can, without an artificial prop called hope.   I guess maybe this is what's meant by surrender; which isn't a negative but may be the only true refuge we'll ever know. Referencing your other post about vulnerability, yours is a gentler and more steady flame than that over-heated ultra sadistic fire shown by the abusers. May your steady candle stay the course; it may not be of benefit to the abusers, but it's very empowering for many (myself, for starters) here to see and be reminded of the values nestled in our hearts.  "
290,"Dear Ah. I never feel that I have much to offer on this forum,  but I just wanted to say that I very much relate to all of your posts, and in this one,  to the feelings of hopelessness.  I think that is what consumes me most of the time.I think that Radical's description is spot on. I wonder if it resonates with you too, Ah?Years into no contact with my parents,  and at the age of fifty plus, I still do something,  however mundane, but my initial thought about the action is always with regards to my parents.  Radical is so right,  I think. Our cruel and insensitive treatment didn't allow us to become people who mattered,  to ourselves or to others. No wonder we feel hopeless. At least here, we are accepted as ""real people""  with ""real emotions"". I am standing by you, Ah.Libby "
291,"Am with someone who is more supportive than any previous partner by a huge margin. He is reading with me, supporting me, doesn’t “chuck me away” when I am spinning out/lashing out and going through very difficult emotions and days. He has helped me to feel safe to talk about my experiences, my triggers and my feelings. However, I keep getting intensely triggered as he is naturally a very sarcastic person. I feel that this is not an insidious NPD type of mocking, and I feel that when we get to the heart of things, after I have triggered, he is sad and apologetic that he has upset me. I have relayed this to him and asked him where his use of language comes from in him, as sometimes I wonder if he struggles to express himself in a straight way - perhaps due to his own experiences with people who speak with twisted tongues. He has acknowledged this and expressed that he feels grateful that I have reflected this as he has felt it has gotten people upset in the past, however it’s not what he wants or intends. I believe him, but I keep getting triggered as it is not simple to stop straight away, and what makes things more complex is that my trigger is to do with FOO sarcasm, mocking and ridicule. I am aware that when I am slightly up/high/bouncy I am quite dry and witty, and when together in this place it feels like I slip with him into a sarcastic banter that I sometimes have to stop, as it can become quite scary for me. In my FOO this would just intensify to the point of real anger and violence. So is sarcasm something to be avoided overall? I’m not sure it feels good to me at all. I’m not sure it’s funny. It feels so ‘one upmanship’ and even when I am bouncy and partake in this, I feel a great sense of inner and outer critic flare up. I find sarcasm and conversational jokes incredibly difficult to process when I am not bouncy, and when I am: down, ‘purple’ (my way of describing waking up like there is a huge traffic jam in my brain), depressed, dissociative, flighty, sensitive, hypervigilant or in anyway struggling with other symptoms (this can be quite a lot of the time, as I can hide a lot, or be quietly harbouring feelings/moods that I haven’t managed to articulate). In these states sarcasm is a massive amygdala hijacking trigger. It feels like these sorts of comments force me to do loops in my head, working out what someone means, and really becoming incredibly worried that I don’t get it, and that I genuinely do not understand why they said it and if they are trying to hurt me. As a result my inner critic berates that I am ruining the conversation, and should ‘just lighten the * up!’, as well as feeling that I am not worthy of clear straight conversation. I usually freeze to a degree, as I start to process, and often consider just shutting up completely. However, this usually doesn’t last long as I feel comfortable enough with my partner to challenge when this happens, and my outer critic quickly engages into a panicky fight mode (“why on earth would you say that to me? You are being sarcastic! I don’t understand what you mean. What did you mean?”), often accompanied by intense micromanagement. I can start to raise my voice and monologue. I wish my brain wouldn’t derail - and I would love to gain a bit more control over this trigger so that I can communicate more healthily and effectively. Right now I am struggling to stay present when this trigger appears, and feel like I am being thrown backwards in a painful and confusing way, mid conversation. Does anyone have any suggestions, advice or a similar story? "
292,"This is a long post (mine often are too) and I'm not sure if I can do it justice. First of all, I'm really happy for you that you have a partner who is not only supportive but willing to look at some of his own issues too. My FOO is very sarcastic too, I grew up with that and also endured a lot of mockery and ridicule. But I also know I resort to sarcasm when things are hard. In earlier posts on here, I couldn't list what FOO did to me in the way of emotional abuse, I could only say ""Thanks FOO for doing xyz"". Anger, sadness, hurt would all be appropriate emotions but I couldn't reach them at that time. I can now. It was good to list all FOO did to me anyway, even if it was all sarcastic. I was starting to write a real email to a FOO member today, then I realised that I was using some sarcasm and I also realised that this sarcasm won't help me. Not that anybody else in FOO is likely to really notice the sarcasm as such or find it inappropriate, but they'll still use it to get back at me somehow. Or it would end up being a sarcasm ping-pong game. With FOO it wouldn't be good for me at all to say how I really feel (hurt and a bit angry in this case) because they're quite OK with me being hurt... So thanks for your post here, helped me along with that realisation (cuz I'd been thinking about your post). Is sarcasm to be avoided overall? Maybe it would help if you and your partner attempt to 'fast' from it for a while? Doing that can help to reveal what's beneath a behaviour. It's easier to fast when you're in inpatient therapy, which is where I first learnt about fasting in this way, but it can be done on your own too. And then be mindful. Take time to see what's coming up, or what else might be going on internally, or maybe what other impulses you have. But if you notice the fasting process is about to derail you, then please take it easy. Do you know who your ICr (inner critic) is impersonating? Often the ICr is telling us something that a real person in the past often told us. You probably aren't 'ruining the conversation' especially since you're part of that conversation, you're maybe sensing that the conversation isn't good for you the way it's going. As a person involved in the conversation, you have just as much right as anybody else to object to the way it's going.  As for ""Lighten the * up"" that sounds like the usual ""You're just too sensitive"", something most of us on here have heard ad nauseam. It's a way for somebody else to place blame on us for their own behaviour, so instead of wondering if there might be something a bit off in their general behaviour or even just in a comment, they turn that all around and blame us. It sounds as if you're really pretty aware and as if you're doing a lot of healing work on your own.     for that. It isn't easy. And it takes time to heal from this Beast and all the ensuing behaviours we've been practising for years just in order to survive. Just staying present when triggered is huge. As is stopping the banter with your partner before you're derailed.  "
293,"Hi I couldn't get to the end of either of the above posts as I'm a bit all over the place but wanted to mention that sarcasm is a bad thing in general. It sometimes comes from a deflective low self esteem type personality but whatever the origin it is bad for people with cptsd.Just try to nip it in the bud somehow, call it out maybe, point out how negative it is? Just a thought. Sarcasm is aggressive, not a good thing at all."
294,"You're right Rainagain, it's not a good thing. When I address FOO in a sarcastic way in my head or on here, that's a whole different ball game from directly in contact with them. It's not the end either, I'm working on better ways to deal. It can be difficult to simply end that kind of behaviour, though. It might depend what's lurking beneath it - untold amounts of pain with nowhere to go? "
295,"I'm a new member here. I posted a brief post in the introductions section.I have no real support system. As I've gone through my healing process, I've had to face truths about how emotionally isolated I have been my whole life. I feel like I have gone through so many varieties of loneliness, each of them just as horrible and internally devastating as the other. I have no intimate connections - no friends, no family, no children and no partner with whom I can be myself, with whom I feel embraced for human being that I am. This hurts me deeply. Because I feel like my whole life I've wanted, no needed, to be seen. And I have been slowly I realising the depth of the wounds I carry from never been seen, never been appreciated or cared for for just as I am. I've identified myself as a freeze/fawn cptsd type, so I survived my traumas from a mix of having to shrink my true self and adopting the roles that were expected of me. My empathetic side was exploited to the advantage of others, without much, if any, empathy returned.The sense of lonliness I feel drives me into episodes of deep depression and anxiety, making me wonder what might be wrong with me that I have no-one in my life to offer me a hug, or a shoulder to cry on. But I am working on this and trying to be gentle with myself, trying not redirect my pain into feelings of self loathing. This is hard.I push myself to go to social actiivities that I find online, turning up at events on my own where I don't know anybody. I tell myself if I provide myself opportunities to meet new people through exposure, then eventually I might click with like minded individuals or people who might want to know me. But it's not easy and even when a new connection is made, it seems to be a whole other ball game as to whether that connection will turn into an actual caring and long term friendship.I think I am quite an introspective and a deeply feeling person, I very much gravitate towards deep and meaningful types of conversations. But often it feels like that's not what others are interested in. I also think that when you've been through trauma and engage in self healing, you become alot more mature and wise in a way compared to the average person who has had a 'good enough' life. This is the case for me and because of this if feels like most new people that I meet are from a different world than me.Another thing is that most new people I meet have solid support systems, they have family and/or friends who love them, so they're not necessarily looking for more. And most people I meet in my age group especially (mid 30's) are pretty well setup it seems when it comes to social support. Whereas I come from a place of it's just me and my beloved cat. This is another thing that makes me feel very internally alienated when I meet new people, even if I share a positive interaction with them. I can see/feel their sense of calm and contentment due to their social bonds. I know that at the end of the day they go home and will have someone there who cares about them or friends who they'll talk to over the phone. At the end of my day I come home to my cat, who I love more than any other being in this world and am so grateful for (he's saved my life). Though there is something to be said about not having another human bond there for you.So often I read that trauma and ctpsd healing requires some element of social support, love, and care from people who are your support system. And I feel the gravity of this in my heart. I feel like I know that despite the fact that I have very little in my life right now, if I had just one person, one friend who I knew was there for me, someone who genuinely cared for me who I didn't feel like I have to wear a socially acceptable face with, I would feel better about my life. I would just feel better.I have read some other posts on this forum where people have expressed having no support system. I would really like to know if anyone relates to some of the feelings I've expressed here. And I would like to know if anyone who has been in a place where they had no loving support has eventually found people (in person) who became that support?Thank you for reading this."
296,"Welcome to our forum, madebynature!I hear the deep pain you are expressing, the feelings of loneliness, the perception that others have a social support network that you are not experiencing at this time.  I have been through times very much like that, and it is isolating, to be sure.As you heal, remember that all emotions are transient and are leading us to new places.  It will not always be like this.  I am nearly 60 now, and do recall my 30s as having been raw and difficult.  But it changes, and good things will appear for you. Also, consider volunteering in some capacity.  Perhaps helping someone elderly who needs assistance in some aspect of life, or even working with animals at the local shelter.  In addition to making some connections, you may come away with new appreciation for what you do have in your life and gratitude is a powerful healing tool as well.Best wishes to you, and again, welcome. "
297,"Hi Madebynature,I'm so sorry you're so alone. I am too. It's a really heavy burden, that. Always leaves me feeling flawed and inadequate and it just feeds my self hatred perfectly. It's a loop that's hard to break.Age is definitely part of it. I'm not in my 20's anymore so looking for new friends isn't what people do anymore. Other circumstances play into it as well. Things I can't control, or change at all. Totally out of my hands. Yeah, self loathing is always difficult for me too... we're social animals and I desperately need to be seen, but I'm never seen. Everyone I know is either an accomplice or an abuser. It's crazy making. Trying to escape it leaves me exhausted. I'm looking for ways to stop trying to escape the inescapable. I know it isn't quite the same as being able to see and hear a person face to face, but you sound like someone I'd befriend in a split second. Introspected, gravitate toward serious conversations, yep. I would invite you for tea and we'd be talking for 4 hours before either of us noticed it, I bet. In my experience, a life full of trauma has been so much worse than just the trauma itself. It left me like a bit of an alien, with knowledge about the dangerous aspects of life that I shouldn't have learned at such a young age. It left me cynical but also very naive at the same time, willing to submit to every abuser and accomplice who came my way in hopes of being seen. So now in the past few years I've been intentionally changing myself, by myself, talking less to people and reading more, learning about trauma and personality disordered people, and watching my own habits. I still have self loathing to work on, it's a lifelong habit... but it's not as all-powerful as it was before. I still can't change circumstances, but I now am better at picking and choosing the sort of people I really do like and relate to. I'm getting better at saying No. At not being seen, and feeling the pain of it, but being able to bear it and learning to be alone with myself and almost like myself, or be able to imagine one day liking myself. Well, sometimes.  I find it easier with people who've gone through hardship, any sort of hardship. I agree with Jdog, when I'm able I work on projects for people who do suffer. Social housing projects and volunteering with people who know pain, like me, whether it's loneliness or also physical pain or poverty or all of it together. Being their friend reconnects me to what I know. It lets me be empathic to others not because my empathy was exploited non stop in the past, but because I consider my empathy an asset and I use it to help someone else a bit. And vicariously, it helps me a bit too.Just between you and me (and the entire web  ) I find the happy people really dull. They have nothing to talk about. No insights. No personal growth. People who have ""met"" real life, harsh life, are more interesting to me. They don't leave me feeling empty and alien. All other things aside, you've got a friend here.  "
298,"Everything written here, the original post and the followups, resonates 100% with my experience. Lonely to the point of despair, unsure of finding it at all anymore. But I too, speak from an older time frame, and there have been some cracks in the armor.One of these was almost accidentally finding myself in a creative vocation involving other people (acting). This sounds wonderful, but it was only a glimpse out of my bubble/iceberg in which I hid most of the rest of me (also a freeze sort). For several years, this kept me afloat but it (and some other factors) kept me distant once the acting part was over.I did, however, acquire 4 dear friends in the process. They, especially 1, became dear friends who had my back. Good stuff, then they all died within short order a couple of years ago, and I'm left once more without any support network whatsoever. Added to this is I live in a pretty remote region, where social outlets can dwindle to bars and/or churches, neither of which I gravitate to.I agree strongly with the idea of finding a volunteer niche in the social service sphere. For several years--when I was more mobile than I am now--I was a hospice volunteer and it was wonderful to be there with people who had no agenda other than ending their days peacefully. But an eye disease (glaucoma) and dwindling resources to travel cut off that possibility. I also did a stint a few years ago for a pre-school program. It was great, but I had to end it as well. For quite a few years, I wrote a very creative column for a local newspaper and while that mostly didn't involve social contacts (albeit some), it was well received and it kept the mind sharp. Now that too has slid off the table, and while I have no expectations of the next step, if there is one it might find me, but I've dampened any wild expectations of finding it. Having to know and then find the perfect way are two sides of the same illusion, though common in cptsd people.I'm still lonely, but another way to regard this is to call it solitary. Going solo isn't an indication that you're a pariah, but for legit reasons you know (and others don't have to unless it seems they might be understanding) your solo life outpaces the social. Again, there's not a zilch wrong with you for being sensitive; in many ways it's a positive, and you seem to know that. While it's disheartening sometimes, it's also not a life sentence.There's more, but it's probably enough said. I'm to the point where full-time intimate social interaction might/might not be in the cards for me. Still, I know how desperate it can feel. Something that's key (and that I too often forget) is to be open to surprise. I was surprised to find a 'healing memories' workshop not far from here; while I have some notion that there might indeed be like-minded people there, I'm not counting on it...just will show up as me.I hope some of this makes sense.  "
299,"Hi, I feel the same to a degree, Im quite a sociable person but can be in a large crowd of friends and feel incredibly lonely like I dont connect with anyone or people just dont understand me, I was talking to my therapist about this and she said one of the traits of cptsd is feeling incredibly alone, it has all to do with the trauma that we have been through and how weve felt as a child - very alone, no one to turn to, no one to share this with and no one who will understand us, we grow up feeling alone and different from other people due to our different life experiences. You to me sound like just the sort of person I would like to get to know, I too like deep conversations and am very empathetic and compassionate, there I dont think are that many people like that out there or certainly not many Ive come across, loneliness is a horrible thing to deal with and I have days where I see no one and just have my own depressing company which can be really depressing at times, Im slowly trying to find new directions in my life and think of me and what I want now rather then worrying about what other people will think of me etc, Im sure a lot of people will admire your qualities which sounds like you have a lot to me. Think about the fact that you have been through a lot of rubbish, you have come out the other side, you are still alive etc, I give myself affirmations every day to make me feel better, I am my support!"
300,"Made by nature,I hope you feel that there is support for you here, great people who have plenty of wisdom.Personally I don't do social groups very well, but I get a lot out of small interactions with people I meet briefly, had a nice chat with a person in a gift shop today where we were both laughing, can't even remember why but it was lovely.I save my existential questions for the good people on here, in real life I just talk about the inconsequential or ridiculous, it works OK for me.Those people you meet every day? They wont understand what we know to be true but they themselves are only one or two earth shattering traumas away from being right here with us. They just don't realise it.I envy them that."
301,"Wow, I am overwhelemed by all the reponses. Thank you.. I will respond to each person, for I'm thankful for each response:--Jdog: It is heartening read your words about emotions leading to new places and that things change and that good things will appear. Thank you for this and the warm welcome. I agree with you that gratitude is very powerful. Being able to feel gratitude for something, anything, has helped me pull through many difficult times. This past week I have started doing a daily gratitude list and it helps.ah: Your post made me teary. Thank you for being kind and saying that you would invite me for tea  and for sharing your insights and feelings. I relate to so much of what you've said. ""a life full of trauma has been so much worse than just the trauma itself"" >> this is so true. So much to be said about this. I also find it easier to interact and emotionally relate with people who have known hardship. What what you said about picking and choosing the people you like - this is something I am getting my head around. Throughout my life I have allowed people to use me through non-reciprocal, boundary breaking relationships and part of that I think stemmed from being so isolated inside and badly needing social contact. As I have been developing boundaries, I am slowly learning to turn down opportunities for social contact with individuals who show boundary breaking behavior. It's a hard thing to do when I'm craving social contact, but learning to say no despite the lonliness I feel is a neccessary step for me. No more sacrifice myself in exchange for a non-reciprocal 'friendships' as that just leaves me feeling more hollow and more alone. What you said about happy people who have not been through hardship being dull - haha, that's so interesting to hear and a refreshing perspective. Sometimes when I am somewhere public and there are pairs of people around conversing and I can hear what they're saying, I actually try to listen to their conversation because I wonder what do 'normal' people talk about. It is amazing how little substance many of the conversations seem to have.woodsgnome: Thank you for relating and for sharing some of your story. Yes, you post did make sense to me  I am sorry to hear that your friends passed away and that you are alone again. I hope the memories of your friends and the connection you had brings some comfort to you. What you said about being sensitive being a good thing, thank you for saying that, it is something I have at times tried to tell myself. I think I do believe it is a good thing, just find it hard to maintain that view when trying to from healing trauma has taken the center stage in my life now. But some part of me does believe that more sensitive people are needed in this world.Eyessoblue: Thank you for sharing your thoughts and for relating to my post. I too have read feeling alone as a child is a significant trait of ctpsd and childhood trauma. And thank you for expressing that you would like to get to know me - I rarely get to express myself to other as I have here and so not being rejected for such expressions and actually recieving something of the opposite is a different experience for me. I also agree about affirmations, I use them too and they really help.Rainagain: Thank you. Yes, from the responses so far it appears that there is supportive and knowledgable people here. I am quite overwhelemed by that right now. What you said here ""They wont understand what we know to be true but they themselves are only one or two earth shattering traumas away from being right here with us. They just don't realise it."" >> wow, that is such an insightful perspective. It has me really thinking. Thank you for that.---Given that so many responses have suggested doing volunteer work, I am going to really consider that and look into what options are locally available to me.I feel very appreciative of all you responses. I have been very scared or unsure about joining an online forum for a long time so it's actually confronting in some way for me to consider that this forum might actually be a genuinely supportive place. I think when a person has been hurt by people, especially the people who were supposed to care about you, it is challenging to understand when you receive the opposite of what you've come to expect from people. I am probably going to read your posts again tomorrow to let it all sink in. Thank you again for reading and providing such welcoming responses."
302,"Made by nature,I'm glad you feel welcomed and heard, this forum has great people.The opposite of what I said is also probably true, but for the trauma we would be sitting on a bench talking about the mundane and inconsequential just like everyone else."
303,"Chiming in a bit late hear, but felt I had some experience to share with meeting people.You described my social experience throughout my life perfectly- inability to fully connect with people, intense loneliness, depression and longing for some type of intimacy. I've looked back through my life recently to find the same pattern over and over- failed attempts to join social circles, getting rejected and ostracized, and wearing another layer of shame and self-deprecation decade after decade. During one recent therapeutic healing session, it was revealed to me that my fundamental development arrest was my insecure attachment to my mother and it's detrimental effects on my ability to relate to others in a manner that considers their needs and emotions in proper proportion to my own. My mother, due to her own traumatic background, recoiled at the sound of my crying as an infant. She was unable to sooth and comfort me in my distress, and that only caused me to cry louder. The resulting punishment and neglect forced me to learn to suppress my emotions in order to get my nominal survival needs met. But my emotional needs went unmet, and thus kicked off that lifelong search for someone who would meet my emotional needs while handicapped with the inability to meet theirs. No wonder every friendship and romance throughout my life was fleeting and fraught with anxiety and suspicion. I was always trying to come up with a new gimmick to meet women and ingratiate myself into social circles and cliques always with failure.It wasn't until I became ""cPTSD informed"" that I became aware of my self-defeating relationship patterns including unrealistic expectations of where I fit in. This allowed me to gain a toe hold with my left brain when, through sheer luck, I met a fellow misfit at a singles trivia Meetup group. What was lucky was that despite her shortcomings and traumatic background, she had a secure attachment with her mother, and thus helped provide me with some emotional regulation. More than anything this past year, I've been in a running battle with my outer critic who wants to do everything possible to break up our relationship. My OC produces endless reasons why I should get out of the relationship- her looks, her nerdiness, etc. But becoming cPTSD informed has taught me that the real underlying reason is my fear of loss, and my fear of my own reaction to a potential loss. The relationship won out because at the end of the day I realized that she was able to love me unconditionally, and that was foundational to the recent cathartic healing sessions I experienced. Now at 51 I'm working to nail down a wedding date with my new fiancee for mid-June.Another precursor to my recent therapeutic success was locating a therapist who I grew to trust, not because of this therapist's knowledge of cPTSD, but because this therapist trusted my knowledge of myself and what I'd learned about cPTSD in a way that empowered us to experiment with modalities until finding one that worked. Contrast this to most therapists who attempt to shoe-horn your particular situation into their preferred modality whether CBT or some novel, patented somatic therapy. Most therapists will sublimely disempower and belittle you in this manner. My current therapist would not even have to know about cPTSD in order to still fit my definition of a ""good enough therapist"".To summarize, a best friend and a ""good enough"" therapist were the allies I acquired and that were *made possible* first and foremost by becoming thoroughly knowledgable on how cPTSD resulted in my shortcomings, relational deficits, and applying that mindfully to ""right-size"" my approach to meeting people. Put another way, becoming cPTSD informed, opened up a whole new world of potential social support not available to me previously when all I was searching for was the perfect savior who could meet all my emotional needs."
304,"Slackjaw99 wow, sorry to interrupt someone else's post but that reply is wonderful, it probably explains why my mother was the way she was with me. Made by nature, I feel for you, I do. Somehow I do have a spouse, children etc, and my children probably know me best of all. But I still feel alone and isolated. Having a dog has helped me meet people but not support as such. It is something T's ask about, and show concern for, I don't really tell anyone what is in my head, except people like the ones here."
305,Such a good post made by nature thank you ... your words could so be my words ... Im trying to figure out at the moment how to motivate myself to keep moving 
306,"i don't know if anyone remembers, but I was dealing with a nightmare situation last year.It was an ethical problem and personal crisis rolled into one.  I got caught in the middle of something that I didn't know how to deal with and didn't feel I could manage.I still can't say what it was without potentially identifying myself and causing myself and many others, problems.  But over many meetings, mini-crises, newspaper articles, legal briefings, intimidation and harrassment, angst and pain, the situation is almost over and has turned out better than I could have imagined - for everyone concerned.  Best of all, despite huge triggers, I coped, and acquitted myelf well, imo.  Luckily, as with everything in life, perfection was not required, but it was hard to perservere.I had an issue which, because of the circumstances, became a part of opening a big can of worms.  I had fantastic support, most of all from my outstanding T, but it has been tough.I thought I would wait until the ' final act' this coming week, afraid I might jinx things by writing that it is finally over, but I feel it really is and this week will just be the icing on the cake.It was hard to not be able to share my tribulations here, but it meant a lot to me that OOTS was here and you were all your wonderful, supportive selves.  This community was still a sanctuary and support for me throughout.Thank you all for being here!"
307,"Yes I do remember, and what positive news! I'm glad that this weight has been lifted and with a good outcome.Well done! Time to finally breathe again yeah? "
308,"This is brilliant news, well done you.Achievement, success, overcoming difficulty, these are all parts of recovery and you have them in the bag."
309,"I remember and I am glad it is almost over.  You did a wonderful job coping.  I know at times it felt like the end of the world, but you hung in there.  I am also glad that you had an excellent T to help you. "
310,"Many thanks Contessa, Rainagain and Dee,The final stage went great.  I still can't believe it is really resolved, it feels surreal.  I feel like I have a big vacancy for a big worry left in my mind, but the truth is that space is for getting on with my life and feeling positive.One thing CPTSD does give us is resourcefulness.  It usually doesn't feel like we have it, but all of us here have overcome a lot.  More than we may realise."
311,I wondered if anyone has watched this as well. The end triggered me. Or at least made me temporarily angry. Do you know what I'm getting at? 
312,"OK,I have a hyper vigilant thing, I am alert for threat and sort of prepared to react.But the hyper vigilance seems to be a very fine mesh net with me, it picks up on small betrayals or unkindness directed toward me just as much as larger more important threat.I am pretty sure someone I have helped a lot put blame on me today for something they themselves had done. They did it to save face and to avoid criticism. It eased a social situation for them at the time, under the bus I went without a second thought.Now, its not a big deal really, their face saving small betrayal helped them out of a situation they were embarrassed about and hasn't caused me much real harm.But I am worked up and furious inside because part of me takes a zero tolerance approach to threats like this whatever their nature.I don't have much energy and have put quite a bit of it into helping this person, I feel this small injustice very keenly.And I will be back helping them tomorrow.A healthy mind would not be bothered, but mine isn't healthy."
313,"I'm not sure of the accuracy about a healthy mind not being bothered. Healthy people get their feelings hurt, too, and feel the disrespect of a reaction like this - IMO, the difference is their boundaries. Where I will want to bury the hurt and pretend it doesn't bother me, I think a healthy person feeling disrespected like this wouldn't  avoid having an honest conversation. Maybe they'd lose a friend, or maybe they'd deepen the friendship. Who knows?   "
314,Maybe that's the fundamental point 3R.Boundaries.What is acceptable and what is not.Its so exhausting to try to stop getting done over by thoughtless people.
315,"I'm sorry that happened Rainagain. Have you learned for sure that you were thrown under?I'm not sure of what the context is, perhaps it might be worth clarifying with the thrower? Acknowledge that you can see why it was beneficial to diffuse a situation, however you're not keen on receiving consequences for errors made by other people?Could be opportune to nip this in case throwing you under becomes a habit.This might be an over the top suggestion or way off the mark."
316,"Sound advice people.I went back to help but also told my truth.It wasn't pretty, the other person is difficult for anyone to deal with, but I stood up to the usual tactics of denial, prevarication, lies, subject changes, retaliatory accusations, everything but the kitchen sink.This person got more and more frantic as I did not accept the lies and distortions and eventually became tearful, a tactic of last resort I'm afraid.I realise now it is the only way to be heard, to stand firm and argue each rubbish point as it is thrown down.Previously I've said my piece but not engaged with the nonsense.I can't do this every day with this person, it was upsetting and exhausting even though the result was good. Need to reduce contact.Excellent advice, thank you."
317,That sounds full on RA. Too much emotional drama for something you did not instigate.Reducing contact seems like the best response.
318,"Exactly Contessa,Some people seem to always cause upset, but that is their stuff, I can't be doing with it."
319,"I surprised my T this week. I popped to the car part shop on the way to the session to get a new wiper blade & asked the man working there if he could fit it for me as I am not usually strong enough to fit the new blade. (Yes, sometimes I use my feminine wiles to get help.) he actually did fit the new blade for me. Not sure I dare go back for the other blade as I have now noticed that needs doing too. The fact that I could ask for help in this way, & get it from someone who didn't have to help me astounded my T. Because, I cannot ask for help from anyone I am close to, or it is very difficult. I find it very hard to ask for things from people in any kind of authority, I hated having to ask for a new spray or cleaning cloth in my old job as a lunchtime supervisor. Mind you, I wasn't the only person to have problems with the staff there, & lunchtime supervisors were very low in the pecking order. I think it is down to transference. You know, people who remind me of negative figures from my past. If I need whatever help I am asking for too much, I become too desperate, too scared of rejection. But, give me, builders, men in garages, yes, I can ask. The flip side is that I cannot tell men who flirt too much to *off, I am very bad at that. I struggle with being rude. So, I can understand why some social interactions are too much, & others are a breeze but it seemed hard to get my T to understand, surely every time you ask for help it is the same? I suppose, for someone who was naturally assertive getting their needs met is easy & is the same in every circumstance. In my experience I didn't get some needs met growing up, no matter how I asked, & my parents did not model assertiveness. Also, my parents were rubbish at direct communication, my mother is unable to say 'no', even when she will never give what you are asking for. I learnt not to bother asking, to be self-sufficient.I am curious about other people's experiences, are some things easy whilst the same thing, in a different place, with a different person feels impossible?G"
320,"I probably have little encouragement in this, since I'm pretty much the same way about asking. It can get pretty ugly--e.g. I'm afraid to talk to someone on the phone, sight unseen, about store hours or something innocuous. My fear of rejection is sky high in that regard. I know it's hurt me many times, but I haven't been able to change the pattern; I can tense up at the merest human contact concerning almost anything.With one exception--when I was able to control a situation. I got involved in what's known as improv/non-scripted acting, and was hugely talented at it. Why? Easy--I controlled the situation. Before and after I was the same hesitant poor soul unable to ask, but in performance mode I'd blow people over. And while I was also good at service-oriented jobs like working in hospice, the direct asking mode never factored in my comfort zone.So I guess the crux is the fear of rejection that rides so deep. If only--those two words remain as troublesome as ever. The easy and not-so-easy, in my case, is tilted to all social interaction being difficult, period."
321,I have so many issues being assertive.  Any step is a huge achievement for me.  My therapist gave me a handout on assertiveness rights and it has helped.  Your post reminded me that I am suppose to bring them with me next time as I have struggled more lately.She says it is because of the way I was groomed as a child.  I think grooming can come from many different forms for many different reasons.
322,"@woodsgnome I completely understand being able to 'perform' I kind of do that for work, in that situation, I am in control.@Dee I think I have those rights too. Easier said than done. I also have a book on non-violent communication. Which, in theory, seems so simple. Equanimity would help, being able to see every encounter as the same, without attaching too much importance to the outcome. Of course, I was groomed to be submissive, not to rock the boat, although it seems to have more of an impact in life away from FOO. In my FOO I was the only one to rock the boat, & want to know the reasons why? G"
323,"Quote from: woodsgnome on February 16, 2018, 05:39:57 PMWith one exception--when I was able to control a situation.It's the same for me. I used to work in very high stress jobs years ago, and I thrived. The protocol was very clear and complex, which probably gave me a sense of control I really needed. When I felt scared of people I could find relief in What Needed To be Done, in a concrete list of stuff to think about and achieve (relieving me of the need to get close to people / stay away and confuse them by it), and I tolerated the stress much better than most because, well... I was so used to it anyhow.  Also, strangers are easier in a way. Maybe because the rules of engagement are clearer and require less trust. Less chances of betrayal and less expectations / hope from our side. Maybe?"
324,"gromit, i agree with you that not all asking situations feel the same.  i have a harder time asking those closest to me because the chance of a 'no' reinforces what i learned a long time ago with my folks - that i have to figure out a way to do it myself since they're unwilling or incapable of helping me.this has shown itself many times after that in relationships, marriages, and even with my own children.  it becomes personal when it's someone i know, someone i think i should be able to rely on, and they turn me down flat with no explanation, or, even worse, a humiliating explanation/excuse.i am more ready to ask someone with whom i have no personal ties to.  if they say 'no', it doesn't hurt my heart.  that's a big difference. big hug to you filled with congratulations on asking.  feminine wiles aside, i would've asked for him to put that blade on just cuz i'm not familiar with how to do it.  same goes for the other one.  it's just not in my skill set, and that has nothing to do with being a girl.  guys can't do a lot of things i can do."
325,"A thought.We post on here about our dark difficult stuff. Intensely personal.We might get a few replies from people we have come to know virtually.Yet our personal pain is here for anyone to poke about in, it could be a field day for prurient vicarious horror show devotees for all I know.I like it! Here is my truth, you are welcome, world, enjoy!"
326,standing right beside you.  those people are not my problem.  let 'er rip!
327,"I have nothing to hide, and no one to hide it from. The shame is not mine. And if people don't believe me, * 'em. My comments are here for my own healing, a far distant second is that I hope I might point others in the general direction of healing. "
328,"Hi, my name is Justin and I'm relatively new here to the forum.  I'm honestly really happy to have learned about cptsd and that there are SOME places at least for support and community.  I developed cptsd in childhood and honestly all the therapists doctors healers and gurus I went to looking for help never mentioned anything like cptsd to me, or even that perhaps I had been severely traumatized and abused as a child.  Anyway, as happy as I am to learn about cptsd, and as eager as I am to recover, after reading Peter Walkers book I feel rather overwhelmed and a little bit hopeless.  Because I am primarily a freeze type with cptsd, I have spent most of my life in avoidance, hiding and isolation to the point where my social skills aren't so hot.  I mean I can do it, I can talk to people and so forth but it's always sort of a mask and the whole experience is very draining for me and I find myself counting the minutes before I can make my escape.  Also because of my constant state of shock fear and confusion growing up I isolated in my room and didn't learn a lot of things so my reservoir of things to talk about isn't so hot either.  Believe it or not as a male I avoided things like sports music and cars because the loud noises and tons of people were extremely triggering for me.  Honestly after learning about cptsd everything makes so much sense now.  I know I need to connect with others, and learning about emotional flashbacks and how to manage them is very helpful, but it's so incredibly difficult that I find I don't want to lol.  I'm also very interested in spirituality and meditation, so when it comes to things like seclusion I can take that to the next level.  I've had a few girlfriends in my life but nothing serious, and I can never 'do it' you know?  Connecting with others in a real and intimate way is something I've never been able to to do, and I always end up pushing the girl away.  I have had to go no contact with my abusive family and so I am alone and have no support system.  Honestly it really sucks and it's hard to go on like this.  I get so angry that I have to deal with cptsd and now I have to go through all this recovery just to get to a somewhat 'normal' place that I just say screw it sometimes.  Anyway, at least I know now what I'm struggling with and how to get through it.  Having cptsd is hard enough but the freeze element of it makes it even tougher to get through the inner emotional ice wall that I have developed.  I wanted to know if anyone here has trouble connecting with others and or in having intimate relationships with others.  I feel so invisible like I'm alive and part of a community but not really.  I work at night as well to give my nerves a break, so it's a very lonely world (although I do like to be alone for the most part).  I'm also underemployed as I was never able to complete a four year university due to intense emotional flashbacks in school settings and panic attacks I'd have and that has made my life extremely limited and narrow.  I honestly hate this and frankly wish I was never born if I was just going to end up with something like this and with no family support or love.  My Mom and sister live 15 minutes away from me but because of how abusive they are and the fact that they don't respect my boundaries, I spent Christmas alone in a cafe with a chicken salad sandwich and some coffee.  In fact I spent all the holidays alone.  And I can do it you know I'm used to it, but it's hard and I'm honestly sad.  I'm looking to go to some coda meetings in the area to at least start to open up and have some intimate and vulnerable conversations with people, and some other spiritual groups in the area.  Can anyone relate to this type of thing with connecting with others?"
329,"  I can relate to almost every word of what you've shared here. I'm definitely a freeze, but found fortune in various creative vocational situations which at least put me in touch with enough people to sustain the notion that there were people outside the bubble I usually feel trapped inside of.There's so many similarities in what you present to my own life that I hardly know where to start. One thing I'd like to make sure and note is to suggest you read Walker's book again, and take notice of the many positives he attributes to the freeze sort of person (awareness, mindfulness, peace, sense of presence, etc). Then try and further develop those as best you can. Sounds like you're doing a bit of this with the coda and spiritual activities you hinted at. At the very least, accept these attributes and pour self-compassion into your life for having them.You are who you are. There's plenty of bad vibes and being lonely doesn't appease the situation much; but the reverse is that because of who you are, it's not like you can run out and become a social gadfly, either--that would be even more intolerable. As stated, I was lucky to find a way to find enough creativity to weave at least some social activity into the solitary. And yes, I especially related to what you said about the constant urge to run--same here, big-time. Not saying this can be totally overcome, but I've developed personal mantras and the like that have helped (and sometimes not   ).Your story also reminded me of Walker's observation that freezers are among the most difficult types to treat, and how we often bail out of therapy. I did that, but found an outstanding T a couple of years back who's been an enormous help at working with me on my issues. So that would be a hope for you--do you have access to therapy now? You did mention the 'healing' professionals who didn't have a clue about cptsd.Avoidance can be as big of a trap as over-trying the social gambit. You're wise to stick to your boundaries, even though the m and sis aren't far off. I accomplished that decades ago when I moved to an isolated area. Something I learned in the process, though, is that no amount of distance totally eliminates the triggers and EFs that seem to follow wherever you are or however far away you think you've gotten. The mind/ego/inner critic is gruesome and tends to find one wherever they try to hide.And dampen expectations for how this trip called recovery will turn out--what it will look like, etc. Step 1 is you've acknowledged the hard row; step #2 is you've at least considered further steps. There's likely to be twists and turns, but as in any trip be aware of the hazards. I'm hardly a shining example of recovery (in my own lexicon I call it 'wholeness'), but I feel like I've found further peace (which can change in about 5 minutes and I'll wonder how I ever said that). My steps included loads of self-study, live therapy, living life as its own meditation, music, and a backwoods lifestyle that suits my extreme need for isolation.  The kicker still is how to relate to people, though. Still trying (but also giving up), which leads me to the final point--no amount of self-compassion is ever too much. That, and loads of patience, starting with acceptance. Oh, and the realization that while the old story was bad, the new one starts...now... Sounds easy. NOT!!!  "
330,
331,"I can relate very much, and I too agree with every word woodsgnome said.Finding out I have cptsd has been a lifesaver for me, but also a source of a lot of grieving. I didn't know I was so deeply wounded... till I found out about cptsd, I had no idea about so much. I was fast asleep. In some ways, waking up is a sobering experience, not always a happy one. I think your decision to have no contact with your family is brave beyond words. I know how painful it is to reach that point and to keep your promise to yourself.One other book I keep returning to, that helps me a lot in understanding cptsd, is ""The body keeps the score"" - about trauma.In my personal experience there's also good, healthy freeze like woodsgnome says. I guess I'll never feel fully comfortable around people who walk around life feeling like they belong... their comfort triggers me, and I feel invisible around them. Being around people is very draining for me too. People who are introverted are much better, but society nowadays is so extremely extroverted, and even if I weren't abused I'm sure I'd grow up very introverted because I'm not just hypervigilant because of cptsd, I'm also introspective. But there's also a lot of good in the things we find comforting. Meditation can be very valuable, it's what many trauma therapists advise their clients to learn. So maybe we have a head start on getting some measure of control over our cptsd  Like you, I know there's a lot I just didn't learn because I wasn't taught to socialize. A lot of the rules of socialization I learned as an adult by observing other people, and trying to keep my self hatred from attacking me when I got things wrong. I notice literally every time I talk to people I end up triggered but the more I understand about cptsd, the level of how much I get triggered varies; when I'm stronger it's much lighter. I'm alone with no support system either, I can deeply relate to your situation and how hard it is. Nothing about all of this is normal in the slightest. The things we had to go through, all the things we still have to go through now... you didn't deserve it, you didn't cause it. Your surroundings weren't normal. I'm so sorry you have to navigate the mine field of cptsd now as a result but you're not alone. I'm glad you're here."
332,"Thanks so much for your response, I really appreciate it.  It's really interesting to meet other people who struggle with cptsd, I feel as though no one could ever understand me, and although many places tell you you're not alone, I truly feel it here.  I am eager to find a 'good enough therapist' as Pete Walker calls them, one who can help me specifically with relational healing, but at the moment I don't have insurance and don't have enough extra money for it.  I have many tools I'm using to help me heal though, which are working well.  The relational part is key though. I like what you said about accepting myself.  I'm learning more and more that yes we can heal and overcome certain things, but this cptsd thing is not something that is going to vanish ever and to one extent or another we are sort of stuck with it.  I am introverted as well so maybe I should just allow myself to be how I am and not beat myself so much (cognitive healing anyone???)Anyway, thanks again, and you said you live in an isolated area somewhere?  That sounds fantastic lol.  "
333,"@ah Thank you for your kind words as well.  You know it'd be really nice if there were groups specifically for people with cptsd to get together at.  I think we could really be a great help to each other, and be able to socialize amongst ourselves at the same time.  Discovering emotional healing in and of itself was a life savor for me, and the more I know what my emotional needs are and how to meet them, the better I feel and the less I miss any outside source of wellbeing such as my family.  It's really just nice knowing that I am not alone in dealing with this stuff.  "
334,"Hi Justin,I can relate all too well to the difficulty of finding connection, as well as what Id call the mixed blessing of learning there is a name for what Ive struggled with for as long as I can remember. I dont know if youre like me, but there are also chunks that I cant remember and I think they frighten me the most because something so incredibly trivial can so easily end up being a trigger and the result is an emotional flashback thats so vague that I cant find any event to link it to. I  sometimes wonder if I tried so hard to forget all of the bad times that I lost the good ones along the way.Im so glad to know that youve established a solid spiritual connection and that youre involved in meditation. As for me, to be honest my connection to my higher power tends to wax and wane. But I can say without a doubt that it is during those times when I can truly embrace my faith that things seem at least more manageable. And I want to give you a huge Thank You! for mentioning that you are looking into CODA meetings. Because of your post, Ive finally gathered the information for the ACOA/ACA meetings here in the area where Ive recently moved. Ive gone to these meetings in the past and theyve helped. I dont know when or even if Ill go again but I took a step and it was your post that nudged me into a more positive direction. Thank you again!When I came to read the description of the freeze type, it felt almost as if Pete Walker was talking about me in particular. As for me, as a child I put much of my energy into trying to be invisible. I figured out early on that if they couldnt see me then there was less of a chance that they could hurt me. Sometimes it actually worked but, like you, being invisible takes a toll on learning much needed social skills. And I SO get the mask you describe. Im going on sixty years old now and I am disabled. But there was a long time when I was able to work. Without that mask I would have starved. Thankfully (in an odd kind of way) as I look back I can see that because I also had a few of the fawn tendencies in my earlier adult life, my resulting perfectionism meant that I kept getting unexpectedly promoted. And each promotion put me on a path to being more and more in the spotlight. I ultimately honed that mask to the point that my last promotion actually put me in a position that required public speaking yeah, seriously! And sometimes Id be in front of a hundred people or more. There were days when I just didnt think I could even make it to work, much less if I had to do a presentation that day. But once I somehow made it there, it was as if I had an on switch and I could fool the whole crowd into thinking I was in my element. I often wonder if I found a way to put myself out there by virtue of dissociating. Thats just a guess because, when I think back on even the smallest of those public speaking gigs, it feels like that was a whole other person who was living a whole other life. (Actually thats pretty on the mark given that Im now agoraphobic but thats another story.) But if Im right, that means that by using what I refer to as my bubble that I developed in childhood, I actually found a way to make it useful to me... just in a very different way. Probably not the healthiest of ways, but hey, we gotta take what we can and leave the rest! LolI agree with the others and I and commend you for your courage in setting - and maintaining - your boundaries with family members. My trick was to move a thousand miles away at 25 thinking I could outrun not only my family, but all of my history as well. Unfortunately I discovered that not only did my history come along for the ride, I had a bunch more stuff to come that would be thrown at me by those same people that I tried to escape from to add to the pile. Being long distance did help somewhat but, without going into details, they served up some more of that stuff that falls into the you just cant make that * up category.I would like to offer you one little trick that I learned along the way that often helps me with interacting with normal people. I think part of why its so hard for us (well for me anyway) to have conversations is because we dont have simple, easy answers to even the most mundane questions from even the nicest of people. I wonder if a part of me also gets stuck with opening up because I want to protect that person from the demons in my past that they couldnt even begin to comprehend so why ruin their day. (Much less come off as a psycho!) At any rate, what Ive learned to do is to turn the conversation back to the other person. Ive discovered that people - even strangers - like nothing more than to talk about themselves okay, maybe its about being heard like wed really appreciate as well but you catch my drift. Lol Instead of feeling obligated to give someone an answer, Ive given myself permission to just say something rather vague (honest, but just the basics) in response and then turn the questioning back to the other person. With each answer, Ill pick up on a tidbit that will give me another question so I can very often get through an entire conversation without giving away a single thing about myself. That may sound sort of deceitful, but youd be surprised. I find that a lot of times Im actually interested in what they have to say. And by the end of our somewhat-shallow interaction, I can sometimes walk away feeling pretty good as if maybe Ive actually made a positive difference in that persons day.   I really didnt mean to go on so long, but I guess what I most want to say is that it sounds as if youre still young at least much younger that me. Im not saying that to discount your experience because this is not an easy road at any age or at any point in our individual journeys. But even though its incredibly hard to connect, you ARE trying and I hope youll give yourself some MAJOR credit for that. Even though youve discovered that you have an issue, at least you now have a name for it now and youve still got time to find solutions. That may not mean much when things can look so dark and, like everyone here, I know that resources for C-PTSD are so few and far between. But there are many more now than when I was around (what Im guessing to be)  your age so that says to me that more are coming. And with each new resource or avenue for answers that comes along, hopefully youll benefit from them you before you find, as I have, that the years ahead of you are far fewer than the ones youve put behind you.Much Love, Many BlessingsPatianne"
335,"Feels like a sea of humanity and still there is no one there that sums it up for me too. I have spent most holidays alone made many dinners for myself and spent most birthdays alone as well. I have been in this world for many years and been dealing with life a lot like you have been avoiding and ducking my head. I have had relationships but they were not there and into themselves more. I would rather be on an deserted island at least I know where I stand, but here I am in a world full of others and I felt like it didn't matter anyway. You have to find your niche and run with it find something that works for you I did, I started my own business and I work for me, keeps me busy and out of my pity for myself, nothing comes easy no matter what walk of life you choose. "
336,"Justin, thank you so much for expressing what Ive been feeling but unable to put into words. Im new to this website and your post just made my night. Ive also been struggling with complex ptsd related to childhood trauma and was never able to feel like anyone understood my challenges until I came across Pete Walkers book. Ive been misdiagnosed with ptsd, bipolar, and anxiety disorders for years and was never able to get anything out of therapy. The social impact that cptsd has had on my life has been the most devastating. I know a lot of people but Im close to no one really. Ive never been able to connect sufficiently with someone to get passed the acquaintance stage. I had a boyfriend in high school who loved me but I couldnt reciprocate because I didnt feel like I wanted to get close to him so I ended up pushing him away. Never been in an intimate relationship because I dont know how to. Whether it is friendship or beyond that. I feel like I lack skills that come so easily to others. But I dont know what Im missing except for the obvious. I get angry at me for not being able to make it happen for myself now that Im an adult, have a job and make a good living. For what? If its without family or other meaningful relationships in my life. The irony is that everyone I know sees me as this very normal, strong person, and even social. Thats why I always feel like there is a glass between me and people. They dont know and I cant relate. Youre not alone. So dont quit. Cause I wont quit and this website has given me hope that there are some people who get it. Thank you!

337,"(Welcome, perstirpes!)"
338,"I agree with all of you.For me part of the picture is realising that cptsd has an impact on so much of who I am, its so profound that just spotting what it is doing is a big job, never mind dealing with it all.What interests me is that so much on here resonates with me. Different causes produce such similar effects.Its like we are all in the x-ray waiting room nursing the exact same injury but have very different causes of the injury."
339,(Welcome perstripes! I'm glad the website has given you hope.)
340,"I have been told by psychiatrist that they feel concern about me. Like they look me and they see I'm suffering (or something like that) and they feel concern. I don't get it. They have told me that people that I know from what, 5 days? They don't know me, why would they feel concern about me?Everytime, when I was... too dissociated... and too alienated, so much that I didn't want to go to the meeting because I knew I could not make a good impression, and when I'm dissociated this is so ""important"" to me, because it feels like people (apart from their personality and personal history) they treat you one way or another depending on how they look at you, what image have you send them, how they feel when they think about you. OBVIOUSLY. That's so obvious. Nobody wants to be with someone that gives him/her bad impression or bad feelings. And you are gonna feel (and by extension behave) differently depending on that. And I ""need"" to have good relationships with people.So it goes like this:I behave ""normal"" -> they treat me okI behave ""strange"" -> they feel ""concern"" about meThey don't feel ""concern"" about me because they know me, but because... idk. As I say that's what they have told me. They see I2m ""suffering"" and they take measurements. Like giving me medication even though they don't know me, or delivering me to another department. Or not thinking that I can make decisions for myself, that they know better than me.I knew this would happen. Why did I go to the meetings then? They parents coerced (obligaron) me to do it. I can't even blame them. Because I don't feel anything. And if I could I would feel so.. shamed, betrayed, afraid, hurt, angry, sad... that I wouldn't even care or think about it.Why do they say they feel ""concerned"" about me? I don't get it."
341,"I think we can feel concern for others, even if we don't know them. I can't see you and I'm concerned, and I hope you can find some answers here.  "
342,"Thanks Three Roses. But I don't understand how they can use that ""concern"" to justify actions that ended up hurting me and justify too the denial of that actions' consecuences. Like: what you do, even though it had good intentions it ended up hurting me so now I feel like I need, idk, to be kept in mind. To acknowledge that it harmed me and that has value.And them: I don't think the same way. It had good intentions, plus you are dissociated, you can't see right now what harms you and what not. It didn't harm you it's just your perception.Seriously, I had this conversation yesterday."
343,"My fear when I was younger was to be alone and tried to hard to fill that gap just to be let down and hurt, I gave it my all and failed. I have been told that people in my life were concerned for me but I believe that they were not, they were going through the motions of words with no actions to back it up. I have been called many things by people and it made me feel like I am nothing without their guidance, well guess what, I am everything without that kind of advice. I have been to counselors and I got the feeling that they wanted a quick fix to get me to be a part of the herd (society). I see that the herd is not always going well for itself, its a lot of drama and hype for what it values and I do not get it, over the years I gave a value of what is important to me and do not want to be moved from that stance. I still want that so called connection to some degree but I do not want to be controlled and trained if I do not believe it what they are doing. I have been in a journey for a peace and it continues everyday, even when I am not going to be what someone wants from me. "
344,"So true. I was so much more when I wasn't with them. I was myself, I was connected.That's something they tell me everyday: ""we only want you to be happy and have a normal life: go to the university, get a job...""I don't care about university or about any job, I want to be myself again. And it hurts so much to think that I was in the right path until they decided they had to do something.The last year, when I was stressed... I would take refuge in the present moment. I would connect with the present and the stress would go away, dissapear... Now I can't do that. The present has become even worse, it doesn't calm or comfort me anymore, neither is a place where I can take refuge."

346,"I am an old solider of this life and world, I had no to little goals, I did not want to do anything but in the same token I had to and forced myself to. When I worked for the ""man"" I felt oppressed, when I started my own business I felt liberated. When I had no education/skills I taught myself if I wanted to know something, today I am a sponge of knowledge and have many skills to my credit. I had nothing to seek out to start, but in my forced attitude I have gained my life by keeping busy, and wanting something better. "
347,Thank you.Wish you hope
348,"Hardest issue in my life is relationships with others, if I have acquaintances that's no worry, they do not know me and so they do not now how to push my buttons. Now friends and family are a different I get the overwhelming feeling that they are simply trying to manipulate me to get something from me and the longer they are around the more they want. I can trace this feeling back to a time when I had very little in my life and set out to earn my way, working hard minding my own business saving for my future and pursuing my happiness (so called). Back then I was forced to man up to get going and so I did, and after a period of time the roaches (friends and family) came out of the woodwork and put pressure on me to give my time energy and money. I thought it was just a feeling that would pass, but it grew much larger than I could imagine and feel like a target for the wolves ( friends and family). I know it has a lot to do with the hyper-sensitivity that I tune into maybe too much, but I believe that I do not want others around me just because they want something, the gift not the giver.  "
349,"There's a lot in your post.Its hard to deal with relationships for so many reasons.Keeping boundaries up, not getting re traumatised, not getting ripped off, not getting triggered and acting out fight/flight, not getting let down by those who should support.Its the thing that causes me the most heartache, the most emotional wear and tear, the most uncertainty, the most anger.Its hard to remain open when hypervigilance means you can spot a negative action from miles away and can't easily forgive or ignore.You have shown determination to improve your situation in the past, sadly its an ongoing battle to hang on to the achievements you have earned.And then there is keeping your recovery in sight through it all, making progress for yourself.I believe it can be done, you can keep on track and overcome all of the above.Thinking of you."
350,My much older brother and sister have always been pretty much in denial of our abusive childhoods which has caused me a lot of added difficulties in working on my c-ptsd. My abusive father died recently and my brother is in insisting on celebrating a wonderful man despite the fact that I often saw him beating my brother. I am finding this really hard to cope with.
351,"Welcome,I have had the same issue with my sister.  Sometimes she has moments of clarity, most of the time she is in strict denial.  My dad died earlier this year.  It was easier for me, he was a person with no family and no friends.The one thing that helped me is I wrote a letter to him.  It was a structured grief letter.  What I like about you, what I didn't like, what I wish was different.  There was a section for what I forgive, but I skipped that.  It helped me deal with his funeral a little more because I had the truth in my hand.  I ended up giving mine to the funeral director to be cremated with him.  I let my sister have her day of denial."
352,"Welcome Nonetheless!I'm sorry about what you're going through atm. It's common unfortunately for family members, including those who were abused too, to be in denial. All the best with it.  "
353,"Same issues here with my father, he is still alive and will pass soon, older brother has been a aggressive little __________ to say were are a family. I chose to walk away from my father over 20 years ago and not to go too far out of my way for him since and he could not put the pieces together of why I did that, I thought it was very clear. My brother was there to fill the slot to have him think he is the greatest son in the world and tries to bully me into doing the same, I will not. My father was rarely ever there for me growing up and most of that time was drunk and violent. My siblings live in denial too and we all have different ways of dealing with our lives, I wanted to try to have a  relationship years ago and  to have decent and civil adult behavior between us,  but too many differences that made it not to be. "
354,"Don't know how to start this with so many different parts of what I want to say swirling around.A while ago, things were going great and I believed that despite the fallout from calling out abuse and being mobbed, in a pretty small, gossipy place, I could repair some relationships and ride out the worst of the fallout.  I felt positive and I was taking bold and positive action.  Then something awful happened.I couldn't discuss it here then or now, because there was no way I could do so without potentially identifying myself, and outing a very tricky ethical situation, which would have had a negative impact on some people who didn't deserve that kind of grief, (including me).  I stuck it out trying to find a solution in a horrible situation.  It took a big toll on me and my confidence. Again, I was trapped and being bullied.  I couldn't have believed the * I was subjected to.  I find it hard to believe that this could have happened just as I was getting back on my feet.  It has been hard to not see it as being about some fatal flaw, in me and evidence that things will never get better.I walked away because there was no solution that didn't involve lawyers and the potential for even greater harm.  Also, that route would cost me dearly, not just financially but in time I can't afford.It was unfair and that's hard to swallow.  I had the misfortune to have gotten caught in the middle of something.  But now I know I have to leave my home in order to be able to start again.  I love where I live, and have a strong sense of place and of home.  And I can't seem to take the actions I need too take.  A horrible paralysis has set in.  I know it is because I'm afraid and I don't want to go, and equally, I know I need to go.I feel hurt and alone and so afraid of letting go of the place I love and the security this place gives me.  I don't feel the confidence to take this leap into the unknown.  All of this has settled into a kind of paralysed depression."
355,"Oh goodness Rad. I know how horrible this has been for you, and am sad that you have to leave a place you love to find safety.Can you take a breather for a bit? Just be in your safe place for a while before making any decisions?"
356,   and otherwise I echo Contessa. 
357,You are a strong person.  You can do what you have to do.  Whatever that may turn out to be. 
358,"Thanks for your support, Contessa, Blueberry,and Dee.This isn't an impulse.  I decided a few months ago.  There isn't any way of looking at this that doesn't say this is the best decision for my future.  If there was another option that was viable, I'd be staying.Wish it wasn't so."
359,"Dear radical, I'm so sorry that you must leave that place. But, I know you know exactly what you must do and so I offer no advice - only that I've had to leave (for different reasons) a place I loved but now live somewhere I love even better.   "
360,"Okay then. I echo the same sentiment as Three Roses. No matter where you go, we'll be there with you."
361,"So you know, you are not alone in this.  We will be here for the entire way!"
362,"Transitions, especially following other transitions that seemed so safe and logical, scare me as well. Even transitioning from reading a post like yours to responding to it. I want to stretch to reach the perfect way to express this and forget one detail--I'm far from perfect; but retain the old fear that only by being perfect will it mean anything.Your transition is a rattling fear of mine, too--I found a safe spot, but found out that's an illusion...at least in that frustrating sense of yes, it's felt safe but far from the perfect safe I though. Still this place I've landed in speaks to me, I'm used to it, and having to upend it like you're doing would be an extreme challenge.So my perfect sharing comes down to trusting you're going to be fine with your transition. We always want fine to be easy--that seems to happen but usually only after discarding expectations about how or why things should go a certain way.I like reading tales of exploration. After the fact, the bold explorers who seemed so brave were anything but. They only barely survived; usually not resembling their bold expectations. No perfection there; only in the stories told of them afterwards by others. Deep down their bravery turned out to more chutzpah than boldness. Fear played its role at every turn, and rarely per expectations and/or the best intentions or planning.So I hope you find that inner light of yours which seems apparent to those of us you've shared your story with. It's too easy for us to be spectators now; I know this sounds trite, but we're with your every step as you undertake this transition. "
363,HiMy response can't be as thoughtful as woodsgnome but I wanted to say that I moved country to escape my stress and it has helped despite all the difficulties and upheaval.Could you take a break away from it for at least a few days to see the situation from the outside? I did that and it helped to firm up my resolve.I am wishing you the strength to do what you need to do.
364,"Hello all-I am new to this website.  So glad you all are here!  A little bit about me, I am an adult child of a narcisisst/borderline mom.  My father passed more than 30 years ago, but when he was alive they fought ALL THE TIME.  Now that I am an adult I understand that he was reacting to the stress and strain of living with my mom.  There was a constant battle for control between the two of them. I never felt safe at home.  This was back in the 70's and my mom's family and just about everyone else knew that there was something wrong with her but nobody knew what.  Her family was always trying to figure out how to fix/help her.  Everyone was always so fixated on her and her drama and control than no one gave any thought to the actual children in her home (me and my sister).   There was emotional and sexual abuse.  As an adult I am now a workaholic/codependent/compulsive overeater.  As a kid I was isolated with her alot.  I skipped over stages of childhood development.  She would force us to wear her homemade clothes.  While other kids were wearing jeans, sneakers, and t-shirts, we were dressed like ""Holly Hobbie dolls"".  This lead to a shame, humiliation, and social ostracism.  It was almost like she was intentionally sabotaging me so that I would never leave.  She would never buy fruits and vegetables.  She was more involved in my school than I was.  She would volunteer with my band to get attention.  Meanwhile I was totally miserable. I don't think she actually needed human children.  American girl dolls would have sufficed or even a puppy would have sufficed.  She needed something she could have ultimate control over.  I was just there to take care of her and to live her unlived life. As an adult I continue to struggle with anxiety, fear of people, and social isolation.  I often spend birthdays and Christmases alone.  I have a sister, but she is in denial about everything she went through an won't seek help.  As a result I often find her behavior in adulthood becoming similar to my mom's.  I go to CODA and sometimes ACA.  I don't really have any emotional support from anyone as there are several narcissists in my family and my long term ""friend"" from childhood I am starting to understand also has some narcissistic traits and probably could benefit from some recovery as well.My sister and her family are the closest thing I have to a family, even though they are narcissistic.  We often spend Christmas together and exchange gifts.  They went out of town this year and I was ok with that.  I asked if we could exchange gifts this weekend.  I didn't really expect anything like a meal or anything, just want to swap gifts and be done with Christmas.  We were supposed to get together today and they cancelled on me.  This isn't the first time they have blown me off at Christmas.  I woke up trying to brace for being blown off and that is exactly what happened.  They said they were sick but I don't believe them.  It's really hard when you have no family to spend Christmas with and no one wants to exchange gifts.   She said her husband would stop by after work tomorrow and drop mine off.  This is not really any fun.  I think I am going to put their gifts to me in the closet and not open them.I have to understand that this is a reflection on them and not on me but it is still hard.  Trying to get healthy behavior from them is like trying to get blood from a stone.   This is triggering alot of the loss and rejection from my childhood so it is a little hard to deal with.  My big goal for 2018 is to find healthy friends, so that I will be less disturbed by my family.When I get upset I rarely vent to anyone, but instead just hold it inside.  Posting like this is new behavior me.  Anyhow, thank you for letting me share. Survivor302000"
365,"Welcome, Survivor302000!  Wow, your story is eerily similar to mine in many ways.  The ""Holly Hobbie"" thing being one of them.  My mom (who suffers from Borderline PD) sewed clothes for me and my sisters as well.  She also always cut my hair short so I grew up being mistaken for a boy quite a lot.  If you haven't read ""Understanding the Borderline Mother"" by Christine Ann Lawson, you may want to.  But be aware that it can be very triggering, and so you'll want to go slow.My sisters and I relied on each other to get through childhood with my mother.  We were each other's best friends for a long time.  Then I went into therapy and things changed.  It's really, really tough when you're the only one who will see just how dysfunctional and abusive your childhood was.  I'm the only one who has gone no contact with my mother.  It's been really painful letting go of these unhealthy relationships.  As you pointed out, it ends up feeling like rejection.  I miss my sisters and the way we used to be, but there's no going back.  I'm so much healthier now.  I love your big goal for 2018.  I have a few friends, but no one I see on a regular basis.  I think I'll work on that this year as well.Be well."
366,Welcome on here Survivor!  You'll find friends on here who'll understand you and validate what you're going through. Not IRL friends but sometimes even better   Looking for some IRL is a good goal too of course. 
367,Welcome! I'm glad you're here.   
368,"Welcome, I wish you the best in 2018!"
369,"Welcome. Sorry to hear your story.I guess it's hard, when we feel alone and small we relie in what we have: like a narc sister. But it's no good. Try to stay away from her. I can see she makes no good to you, even if you feel you need someone..."
370,"For  those who don't know, the Knowledge Argument is a mental experiment in which is said that if a person was locked in a room, with no other colours except from white black and grey and no posibility of seeing other colours, even though the person knows everything about the Electromagnetic spectrum, the wavelengths... does s/he really know or understand what the colours are?Here you have a link to the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argumentThe same happens with things like dissociation, deppression, trauma...People may have never experienced that, but they know exactly what the symptoms are because they have studied them, but, do they really know what they mean? Of course not, they don't know how it feels, they have never experienced that, they have never lived that, so, are they really capable of treating it?Or maybe the other way around, maybe they have lived all their lives dissociated and now they are told they ARE actually dissociated, and maybe they know what's the difference between being and not being dissociated because people have told them it, but, do they really know it? They have always been this way so, they actually can't imagine, even less remember, how it FEELS, what it MEANS to not be like that. So, how do they know what are they looking for exactly?The answer is no, the person doesn't know the real meaning of the words s/he thinks s/he knows.*I don't know where to put this post so move it where you want.*"
371,"Hi,A lot of the people I know who work in the mental health field are drawn to it because they have direct experience of some aspect of mental health.Not sure about psychology, people could be academically interested without direct experience.I think the issue for me is that some counsellors/therapists are pretty terrible whilst others are good.Whatever the reason is for that, I think its an important issue."
372,"I really think I need to repair myself somehow before going out. I don't know how to express this, so I'm going to use a metaphor.*Spoilers for TLOK*For those who don't know, The Legend of Korra is a show that takes place in a world where people can control the elements, but only one person can control all four, that is the avatar. TLOK tells the story of the avatar Korra and how she faces one by one all the villains and grows as a person.At the end of season 3 we can see Korra in a wheelchair aftee her battle, and we know that everything is not ok. In season 4 is when we learn that Korra is not only in a wheelchair, but also showing symptoms of PTSD.Korra had to learn how to walk and fight again before going out there to the world. For her, it was something basic.I'm not saying people in wheelchair can't live their live by their own, but it makes everything very difficult, and fighting even impossible.So my metaphor is, like Korra needed to learn how to move her muscles again to go out, I need to learn or ""gain"" some level of lucidity before going out there, because it's the basic thing you need to have to properly ""interact"" with others, because life is basically that: interaction.Live is a struggle, a battle, and we need to be prepared before going out there.When Korra was in the wheelchair she couldn't live by herself, she couldn't go out of her house, she needed to be protected. The same happens with me: I need to be protected until I'm able to go outside, until I'm able to fight again. It's not something I would like, it's something I need.It's true that even she was able to walk again, she still had PTSD. I'm not saying I need to heal my C-PTSD before going outside, I'm saying I need lucidity before going outside. I know the only place where I will finally heal is outside, but not now, not like this."
373,"i hope you find the lucidity you seek, blanca.  clarity, balance, stabilization, and understanding can all be helpful, too, i think.  i agree that fixing the parts of ourselves we need to function well 'outside' is do-able.  best to you with this.     "

375,"I know I'm socially inappropriate. And I know why.I always seem to stare at people for too long, I smile with an obviously fake smile, my voice, my facial expressions... what I say, the way I say it, the moment I say it, the context, which words I use to say it...I have my mind foggy, I'm numb, everything seems unreal and I can't quite understand what's going on.The last year I was convinced (and still am), that the only way to make things right is to wait until my mind is not foggy, or is ok, to interact with other people. It's just that... when I interact when I'm ok, everything is ok. But when I interact when I'm not ok, nothing goes right."
376,"I was unsure of where to post this so I figured the general discussion session might be wise. If I am wrong, please feel free to move it or let me know. I found myself really excited to get the news that my S is having a girl. This is going to be my first niece (abbreviation for this?). However, after this excited was a wave of concern and realization. That little girl will grow up in the same world that I did. She will live only about 15 miles from where I grew up. Her parents will be different, but I know mine will be very involved. My M has changed some but not fully. I realize that I am scared for her to grow up in this world. I am scared to let her be so close to that place, it always bothered me with my cousins but not to this extent. I live far away from my FOO and that gap will only grow larger in the coming years. This realization hit because I won’t be there to protect her. I will visit and be the cool aunt from afar... but I will never get to protect my niece. It isn’t my job, but some of the old feelings that I had attached to my S come out. Matter of fact that is a realization in itself... I am attaching old feelings from having to protect my S onto my future niece. They told me her name today, and somehow it makes it more real, and scary. Anyone ever experience this? "
377,"I don't have experience here but wanted you to know I hear you. If I found out I was going to be an aunt, I can see where it may trigger me a little.  Hugs to you, you most def will be the very cool aunt!  "
378,"Hi Elphanigh. I have a neice in her late teens, daughter of my GC sister.  When she was younger,  I didn't worry about her, but as I got to grips with all the dysfunction in my foo,  I did start to worry. As my sister was enmeshed GC, she decided that her daughter was ""granny's girl"".  My parents drove about 100 miles each week to care for her while her own parents were working.  Nm started saying things like "" she is just like me, so worried about what she wears.""  This little girl wasn't worried and knew exactly what she liked to wear. In itself,  this doesn't seem of much concern. However, nm always said to, and about me, how much I was like her etc.  Even as a young child,  I felt uncomfortable with this, as if I didn't want to be like her, and just wanted to be like myself! I truly believe, now I have more understanding,  that she was grooming my niece for her own needs, just like she had done with me.Fortunately,  GC sister and family moved abroad when neice was just a toddler.  I think this saved her from my nm.  Interestingly, despite it always being said that she would study law like both her parents,  she is actually doing a degree in psychology.   Both my dd and I did psychology degrees and it was very frowned upon by my foo.  I so wonder what made her choose this and how my foo reacted.My neice is in contact with my dd on social media.  I am pleased about this and like to hear that she is doing well. Hope you can enjoy being an aunt. Libby "
379,Thank you both for the replies. It is helping validate this but also helps me worry a bit less  
380,"Hi everyone. My boyfriend has been diagnosed with PTSD.He often says he feels numb, emotionless, deattached, no purpose, feels bored of life, is flat in emotions. He went through something extremely traumatic some time ago..He has told me that he struggles to feel love for me (although previously in our 6 yr relationship he used to love me and always express this).I have a some questions and I would love to get some insight in to this. This is affecting me a lot and I have spent so many days being upset.1.Has anyone else (diagnosed with PTSD) experienced that they struggle to feel love for their partner? 2. He sometimes tries to look for faults in our relationship, for him to be able to say ""okay I am not feeling love because of this"". And mostly these are very petty faults (that he never brought up before). Is this something common? Why is he trying to look for excuses?He has on many occasions told me he feels ""dead inside"", he has no emotions what so ever.I love him dearly and I feel broken hearted, I just want to understand whats happening.."
381,"HiI was treated for PTSD in the past, things got worse for me and I now have cptsd.I recognise what you describe very well.Unresolved trauma can lead to numbing, emotions which are overwhelming are 'stuffed' inside as a coping mechanism.Emotional numbing is a way to try to hold things together.As well as the anxiety, depression is pretty common which adds to the lack of interest in life.Its not about your relationship, its the trauma which is the problem.You don't say if he has had treatment, if not he should try to get help, it is treatable and things can get much better for you both.The picking at minor faults is also common, if you have experienced trauma its hard to know what is dangerous and what is not so small things become magnified.There is lots more I could say, best for you to get one of the books recommended by others on here, I don't read books much but there are lots of books and websites around."
382,"Hi I can totally understand what hes saying because I feel exactly the same, I dont know what love is therefore unable to express something that I dont know what it feels to feel. My life just feels like its on a constant flat and even if something really amazing is going to happen I feel expressionless and numb, I think through therapy its helping tho for me to start to feel something, but trauma has a huge impact on every day life unfortunately."
383,"I really feel treatment helps with this.  It helps with the numbness.  Still, therapy is work and a person has got to work to feel."
384,"Thank you all for your responses and giving me insight in to this. I am still very new to PTSD, I want to understand and support him the best I can. I take what he says extremely personally, and it does not have the best effect. For example; after his PTSD diagnoses and when he has his bad days, he claims that we don't connect/don't have much to talk about/there is no excitement left. Before his trauma, he never complained about this and we had been together for 5 yrs. The more he finds faults, the more I start to think that I AM THE PROBLEM. I just don't understand why he has to ""look"" for ""faults"" in our relationship, when we were perfectly happy before.I can't begin to describe how awful I feel. I feel like my ""old boyfriend"" has died, and Im now having to bury the the memories of us happy together. Yes, some days are great between us, like before..but most days now he is not himself. He also had a previous diagnoses of GAD (diagnosed 10 years ago), which definitely does not help the PTSD. He is a shadow of himself and I feel broken hearted. He gets so angry over the smallest things (he NEVER used to have a temper), he is so numb, emotionless, unhappy..I miss his big laughter and smile. He wakes up in the middle of the night due to flashbacks, nightmares. He struggles with extremely intrusive thoughts. He is constantly super tired. He wakes me up in the middle of the night crying because he is so anxious. He constantly stated that he feels ""dead inside"". He says that he always has to keep busy so he does not think, and he can't ever relax. Is this relatable to people who have PTSD, I don't know many people with PTSD. I want to learn more. I want to be supportive and I feel extremely guilty of my reactions sometime. Sometimes I think I do add to his stress, but I am so new to this. Thanks all again, and if there is any other advice, wise words that you guys can contribute with...Id love to hear it"
385,"Your poor boyfriend is really suffering.If you think about all of his symptoms you should see that you are not the problem at all.These are all anxiety and trauma symptoms, I have all of the things you describe.The best support is patience and calm, if he is exhausted and forgetful he probably hates how he is, I know I do.If he has a diagnosis I assume he is getting therapy and/or medication, they are the normal treatments and tend to work, at least a little."
386,"Wow, I'm really moved by your wanting to understand and be supportive as much as you can. That's really great of you!I may not be the best one to talk about depression. I have infrequent extreme bouts of it, and not the more common long lasting variety. I hope I can shed some light on other things though.The first thing I want to point out is that this has an effect on you too! I haven't seen it mentioned here, but you're a secondary survivor. It's very important to both of you that you accept that, and handle it appropriately.Another big thing (bear with me here!), is that some of the details in your story seem contradictory. I point this out to say that it looks like a very complicated situation. I don't want to discourage you, but my hope is that you have realistic expectations. From what you've said so far, it's going to be a lot more like smoothing out a very large tangled knot, as opposed to slipping a bow undone. It will likely take a lot of therapy and treatment of different amounts at different times to get to where he wants to be.Please also do your best to be understanding of his situation. I'm sure he wishes he could get better rest, that he was happier and was able to give those big smiles and laugh. Imagine having the worst day ever, every single day with no end in sight. I understand it looks like he is ""finding"" faults in the relationship, but I expect it's him missing how things were, like you are. He's not who he used to be, and that's difficult to understand on top of the difficulty of everything else he deals with, and with your confusion (being very new to PTSD), it's rough. With everything he's going through, I expect all of this is amplified in his mind drastically. That's one thing I've told repeatedly told people over the years. Imagine what you're feeling (in this case about your relationship) x1000, and that's what he's dealing with on top of all his other symptoms.I can relate to a lot of the things you've mentioned, even the seeming contradictions. In my case, it had doctors prescribing me medication from every category there is, it turned in to quite a mess for a few years.The most important thing I can tell you, is that he's on a journey to find healing, and he's often stuck in survival mode, against his own will, and possibly without his knowledge. You can help guide him, but he must ultimately make his own way through.Again, it's really great how you're looking in to this with him. Please feel free to ask about anything else. It would also be great for him to get involved with a community/support group and ask his own questions.All the best to both of you!"
387,"Thank you all for your responses.Its an awful situation. I do think I need to see a counselor as this is actually affecting me a lot. Hes become very distant in the past week, an event triggered his trauma and its been worse. He says he isnt capable of having a relationship right now as it stresses him out.I feel helpless and heartbroken to be honest. I feel like my old partner has passed away and Im here burying him. Its awful. I cant begin to explain my pain. Jazzy, thanks for your reply. You mentioned contradictions. Can you please explain these so I could clarify? Theres so much to the situation. Again, Im just here trying to understand. Its hard because I do take his doubts very personal. I need to learn not to. The best advice I got was from cornerned spouse, supporting happily from a distance. I think that would be very useful in my situation. Xxx"
388,"have you looked up ptsd, its symptoms, its effects on relationships?  one thing i've found is that the more information i could get my hands on, the better i could understand what was going on and, more importantly, why.i'm with the others who mentioned treatment.  it sounds like therapy would be good for both of you, both separately and together, if it's at all possible.  any traumatic stress wounding can be helped by someone who has professional experience with it.  you are being wounded now as well.  i would think you could both benefit from some professional help.if he isn't willing to go, you could still go on your own for yourself.  unfortunately, ptsd can wound the ones we love - it starts within one person and spreads its tentacles to ensnare others who are closest to us.  i totally understand how it can feel like you're burying your old boyfriend - this is someone new, created by the trauma that happened to him.it's not his fault, it's not your fault.  it sounds as if he's attempting to simply survive at this point.  has he talked about suicide?  if so, it may be a warning sign that he's very close to the edge, and a phone call to a helpline would definitely be in order to help keep him safe.i've heard of this happening with other couples, by the by.   it is heartbreaking in the extreme, and my heart goes out to you, too.   hopefully, this trauma can be dealt with and resolved and the two of you can find a way to pick up the pieces and resume what you once had.  wishing you both the best with all this.  sending a hug full of compassion and care."
389,"Quote from: boyfriendhasptsd on December 08, 2017, 09:42:24 AMI do think I need to see a counselor as this is actually affecting me a lot. That sounds like a very good idea to me.

390,"There's a lot of very good points here. I agree completely that educating yourself and seeking out your own counselor are great ideas. I think your feelings are perfectly natural, and I don't think ill of you at all for having them.QuoteHe says he isnt capable of having a relationship right now as it stresses him out.I'm very sorry. There's really no words to do justice for how that feels. I can relate somewhat, I was told that about a month ago.  QuoteJazzy, thanks for your reply. You mentioned contradictions. Can you please explain these so I could clarify? Theres so much to the situation. I'm afraid I shouldn't have said anything about this. I really didn't mean to be judgmental at all, I just wanted to encourage you (both) to try to gain a better understanding of things, especially if medication is going to come in to play. What I meant is that you have used words to describe his mental state like ""numb"", ""emotionless"", ""dead inside"". At the same time, you mention actions which suggest the opposite ""he gets so angry"", ""he wakes in the night with flashbacks/nightmares/anxiety"". Please don't feel you owe me an explanation, or that you've said anything wrong. My only intention in saying this is to help. It's really difficult for someone on the outside to understand the thoughts and feelings on the inside. It seems really unfair, but the closer it can be explained to someone outside trying to help (counselor, therapists, doctor etc.), the smoother the process will be.I'm sorry if I've caused any trouble."
391,"I got into work today and received an email that this week is ""Disability Awareness Week"" so I was reading it and was surprised to discover that there is an ""invisible disability"" section.  This is what it said:“To define invisible disability in simple terms is a physical, mental or neurological condition that limits a person’s movements, senses, or activities that is invisible to the onlooker.  Whether it be mental illness, a learning disorder, a chronic condition like rheumatoid arthritis, or even an addiction. ""Just food for thought on this snowy Tuesday morning.  I went and saw my psychiatrist yesterday and he ""officially"" diagnosed me with CPTSD, and wrote me a letter that i can give to work. So that made me extremely happy."
392,"I would love an official diagnosis. Does this also mean you will be receiving trauma-based therapy? I hope so! Seems to me that awareness is spreading for us, good news!"
393,"yes!! my work does offer an employee family assistance program where they cover a certain amount of sessions with a therapist.  With this letter, I am hoping my work will extend my sessions considering my therapy is long term   i also got my GP to write a letter that she recommends long term therapy for me as well.  Fingers crossed!  Its very different in this province than it is back home.  Back home psychiatrists offer psychotherapy as well as perscribing medication, diagnosing, etc etc.  So if I saw a psychiatrist back home, it would be completely covered under the health care plan, here, psychiatrists ONLY prescribe medication and do diagnoses, so I am on my own to find and pay for therapy that my work wont cover under my insurance. smh"

Can’t really share too much about my condition in the group setting due to the fact that I feel nobody really gets it and I feel so isolated. As you know but the general population doesn’t, complex PTSD is a whole other ball of wax. I just recently discovered the paper on this forum  about the inner and outer critic. So grateful for some direction. I feel so grateful to have found a place where I can be heard!!!!"
395,"paintedcloud, so very glad you got your diagnosis and will be offered professional help.  that is absolutely great to hear.strive2b, i've also been involved with 12-step groups in the past and felt very much the same as you.  not only couldn't they relate to me, but i couldn't relate very much to them because my addictions were only symptoms of the big picture of my life.  i'm not surprised your sponsor doesn't understand.have you seen a therapist for the c-ptsd wounding?  i doubt that you'll get relief or even acknowledgement in a 12-step group.  c-ptsd calls for help particular to its own beast.  just wanted to let you know you're not alone in that struggle.hugs all around."
396,"strive2B, I've had similar experience with 12 step groups as sanmagic. Before it was evident that CPTSD is my problem, the groups helped me keep my addictions somewhat under control, but eventually I started going ballistic in groups, which I mostly kept under lock and key so to speak. Occasionally I flipped out and eventually stopped going. I agree it would be good to see a trauma informed T. I love your puppy, so cute!"
397,"I wanted to share that I spent Thanksgiving with my Mom and we got along great! She has learned to not bait me implying and assuming I am not capable of living life with my goals and guidelines, while I have learned not to overreact thinking she is implying that. We found a happy medium and I truly enjoyed the time I spent with her. We have forgiven each other and learned to be better together and I am thankful to God for helping me to restore my relationship with her, I love her dearly.Thank you."

402,"Disclosure:  Brand new to the forum and am unsure if this question fits here...I was hoping to get some insight with respect to Social Media. In 2015, I deactivated my Social Media accounts - they were just too triggering for me.  The challenging opportunity is that almost every resource for healing and support can only be attained by having active Social Media accounts.How do I best reap the benefits of joining a Social Media Support group without causing further CPTSD emotional flashbacks?"
403,"Hey there Lost, welcome to the forum. ^^Not sure if I can give you the best answer on this but I can try.  I stepped away from social media as I found it all too triggering as well. But I've found forums like this one, that focus on CPTSD or PTSD is very helpful. We let others know if a post we write may be triggering, adding a""trigger warning"" so you can just read around it if you wish!"
404,"Hello and welcome! In Facebook (or as I like to call it, fail book  ), there are options where you can customize your preferences, and I've done that ... But things still squeak through. But, if you have an account there, you can use Messenger to stay in touch without having to even look at fb. Thanks for joining! I hope you get as much support out of this form as I and lots of others have! "
405,Thanks A...A... and Three Roses for the responses and the welcome!  I appreciate you both.
406,Welcome to the forum  I can't give you an answer because I've never been on social media. Joining this forum was my first venture into posting things about myself into the ether. This forum has become a life-saver to me. I hope you can get lots of support here too.  
407,"Thank you, Blueberry."
408,I don't have a FB account as find it way too triggering and intrusive.  My FOO have NDP and are very enmeshed with each other so privacy became a real issue for me over time.   I don't know if a Twitter account is what you're looking for but I created one for OOTS and you don't have to use your real name and no-one see's your email address.  I intend to create a personal one once I get the hang of tweeting so I can follow other people and orgs that aren't relevant to OOTS.   FB though - never    
409,"Hi everybody,I am new to this forum and I am glad to join here.I do not want to make the introduction part to long, so I just tell youwhat my ruminating thoughts and triggers are:- topics like sex, pick- up, party and youth- Masculinity- Mixed Martial Arts, Soldiers, Warriors- People who live theis life like they want to be- old ageI am 40 years old and male. Even though I had some erotiv interactions with a few women before, I had sex just at the age of 29.I had panic attacks, anxiety and felt most of the time pretty down all of my life.I felt I have not lived like I should have. My father was a pretty ""manly"" man and he bragged about his way of being when younger: lots of women, bar-fights, after this he still mannaged to become a doctor.I had a lot of trouble with racism when I was younger: skinhead, schoolteacher, and bullies.If something like the above mentioned gets triggered, I feel lost and alone, I feel pain, sad and somehow really not safe.I feel like a total looser, in these moments.I have the feeling to counterballance all of the above through- having more sex with women, which does not happen- fighting some kind of full-contact sport- and being succesful in life, means going my own way.Sometime I just want to relax and a part of me tells me everything is actually okay, have compassion for yourself,but immediatly a part comes up and destroy it.It feels I have to do all the things above, to heal the cptsd, which I think will not work.I would love to hear your opinion about cptsd and masculinity etc.?Thank you so far!Best,Logan"
410,"Welcome, Logan, I hope you find your stay here informative and educational. I have some things to say to you which I hope you will read, and know that I sincerely want them to be a growing, healing experience for you (which you may not see at first, but I hope you come to understand).Healing comes from the inside, and expresses itself outwardly. It's an ""inside job"", so to speak. The things you believe about yourself are what causes you pain, not the way the rest of humanity sees you. If people say to me that I'm worthless, at some level I have to believe that in order for it to hurt me. If I don't believe it, hearing that someone sees me in a negative way would be as hurtful as someone calling me a loaf of bread. It would just bounce right off of me.Dysfunctional ways of coping with our pain include outward behaviors, such as:sexual dysfunction, i.e., being promiscuous or viewing pornographydenying ourselves foodharming ourselves, cutting etcdrug and alcohol abuseanger issues...and the list goes on. Healing from CPTSD will include learning to treat ourselves and our bodies with respect, treating others with respect, the healthy expression of our thoughts and feelings, identifying and shrinking the inner and outer critical thoughts that we all seem to have, relational and emotional healing, and so on. As a woman, I felt invalidated, objectified and dehumanized by your post. Having sex with women is not a way to heal yourself; a sexual relationship with a woman (or a man) is a relationship with a living, feeling, human with her/his own likes, dislikes, opinions, and way of being. I'm sorry for you if you've never experienced a deep, intimate relationship with a lover before. There is nothing wrong with MMA as a physical outlet and expression of health and well-being. But just engaging in physical activity like this without going thru the more difficult inner emotional healing will get you no where. It's just a band-aid for the pain that you're in.I hope you stick around here, and do some research into the origins of your pain. We're here to answer any questions you may have about our own personal growth and development and the ways we've found to heal ourselves. Good luck in your journey, I sincerely mean that.  "
411,"QuoteI had a lot of trouble with racism when I was younger: skinhead, schoolteacher, and bullies.Logan, you felt the sting of racism so you know how it feels when others devalue, objectify or degrade you. Here you have an opportunity to recover from CPTSD and lead a deeper,  more authentic and connected life than your father.  I'd encourage you to take a first step towards that by challenging his sexist, manly version of masculinity perhaps, seems good place to start.     "
412,"Seems like your father was a toxic person... which kind of person talks about fighting in bars like it is something you have to be proud of? Having lots of sex with women? Being more successful? It seems like you have a list with which you think that if you ""complete it"" people will finally love you, but I think you already know that. If you really wanna be happy, you have to let go of that, but I know you don't want to (otherwise it would be easy to let go), because your father raised you that way (which is horrible, no man or woman should be proud of being aggresive and violent, because it doesn't make you more of a man, it makes you more stupid). Why don't you check videos about toxic masculinity and the alternatives? Here, check this one: https://youtu.be/Gha3kEECqUk"
413,"If you had a traumatic bond with an abusive individual, how did you break it?  Even after years of no contact, the trauma bond still exists for me, and is why I unfortunately restarted contact.  I'm now working on cutting off this person forever, and I'd like to be free of the trauma bond as well."
414,I unfortunately do not have an answer for you. All of my bonds were forceably closed. My father came into the picture again and so did the court system and then my mother disowned me and sent me boxes full of junk papers of me telling her how I would never leave her...to represent the 10 years of my life I lived with her. So I never really had a choice. None of her family even contacts me. Probably believing the lies she's told. So I hope that some clarity comes to you on how to best address your situation. Melodie
415,"that trauma bond, as you put it, can be nasty.  i fight against it regularly with people with whom i've gone nc.  it's an ongoing battle, over years and with more than one individual.  i just keep telling myself to remember how bad it was and how there's nothing i can do to make it better.  it's a little easier over time.  i don't know if i can get over it completely.  still a work in progress.  thanks for sharing.  big hug."
416,The article (link below) really helped me understand trauma bonding in a new way. It explains why it is so hard to let go of toxic relationships. I have been out of said toxic relationship for almost 20 years and have been no contact with my ex from this relationship for about half of that. I was still struggling with intrusive thoughts about him and our relationship. This article helped me a ton. It explains why it is harder to let go of these kinds of relationships as opposed to healthy relationships.https://tealswan.com/resources/articles/why-you-cant-leave-the-relationship-intermittent-reinforcement-r210/
417,"Welcome Kim and thank you for sharing.I too have trouble letting go of those relationships.  I too have restarted contact with a person who has abused me., my mother.  I was younger then and desperately wanted a mom.  Now, I'm struggling to let go of something that could never be."
418,"Thank you for your replies.  Kim, thank you for the article on intermittent reinforcement.  For me, the cycle would go like this: an explosion of abuse, then a silent treatment, then I'd beg him to talk to me, and then we would ""make up"" - always sexual.  And I knew he would abuse me again, but I kept hoping that *this time* it would be different.  It never was.  I kept looking to him to heal the wounds he himself chose to inflict.  He knew I wanted his affection and kindness, so he withheld them more and more until there was nothing left.  There was no rhyme or reason to his outbursts of rage.  Sometimes he'd be in a generous mood and treat me nice(r), but most of the time he was cruel, and I never knew what I'd get.  The intermittent reinforcement had me hooked.I'm doing my best to keep enforcing no contact now.  I recognize this all for what it is.  But it's still difficult, and I'm ashamed of that, of the attachment.  "
419,"The Spartan Life Coach (Richard Grannon) just posted a video (on Youtube) that touches on this topic. He argues, and I am afraid he is correct, that part of the holding on process is due not just to the repetition pattern - the idea that we enter romantic relationships and even friendships with people that resemble our abusive caregiver in order to try and 'fix' the relationships we had with the caregiver (and we never can succeed) - it is also due to the fact that to stop the hanging on we are forced to admit that our caregiver did not love us in the first place, so the relationship (in real or in replica) cannot be fixed in the second place. I am finding from personal experience that that has been true for me. Also, while I have been NC with my NM and much of my FOO for years, I do still sometimes want to 'reconnect' with my NM (recognizing that no true connection is possible). Here, it is not a matter of finding a proxy to help 'fix' the relationship but wanting the real-thing (or ironically my illusion of the real thing). That bond is so hard to break. I am finding, however, that the more willing and able I am (and those to conditions do not always coincide) to admit that I was never loved by my NM (and likely not my enabling father either), to feel those horrible feelings of abandonment, anger, loneliness, anger, etc., and to mourn my loss, the more I am able to separate from the abusive people in my life, real or proxies. Grannon apologizes for being so blunt on the topic, and I apologize too, but really, I think that might be the only key to getting out of trauma bonds.  "
420,"Vanilla,I resonated with your post. Facing the reality and the emotions of not being loved by, in my case, uNPD mum/family system. All that comes from that one reality. It was not a family, I was not loved and on top of that, the abuse fed their parasitic nature. I had to sit with all that, cry, scream, mope, trudge, punch pillows, everything. For years. NC, for me, is essential for healing the trauma bond and all that comes with having been raised in a NPD/Sociopathic family system. I don't know if this helps. I hope so. "

422,"Hi people.  I don't know if I'm in the right place, but here goes, perhaps you can show me where to go if I need to be somewhere else.My partner has CPTSD, due to neglect and abuse from her mother during her childhood.  I have supported her journey of recovery since we got together two years ago, although it has been a rocky road, and its only in the last three months that my partner has become aware and comfortable with self identifying as CPTSD.My problem is my boundaries - i feel like I don't have any, that they are walked over continuously.  I arrange my life to make sure she feels safe and in control, which means not going out on my own, not developing relationships with work colleagues, and most significantly dealing with her rages and being 'frozen out' when she's in fight/flight (reliving her trauma).  I recognise that I have my own issues of people pleasing and avoiding conflict, so we are a perfect match (sarcasm!).It's just reached the point where I am thinking of moving out as I don't know how to protect myself any more.  But I have become really close with her two children, and I don't want to see them hurt or abandoned by me.  We are in therapy, and I want to continue this, but how do I step in and say 'I need boundaries' without her feeling out of control/shame, and pushing me even further away?If there's a 'partners of those with CPTSD' forum, please direct me, because I really need help.Thanks,Dave x"
423,"Hey Dave! People pleasing is a hard habit to break, and I think it requires alot of awareness in situations. Being aware of your own reactions to situations, aware of what you really want to get out of the situation, be aware of how you can get your own needs met - and of course room to explore these different aspects. There's a few skills that I've learned in DBT (dilectic behavioral therapy) that might be helpful to you. I'll just list them down below here. First there's a script you can use, it takes a lot of practice (I'm still practicing) to be able to do it. But it's a script that allows you to ask for something, or voice your opinion. I think this one would be quite helpful in relations to your partner and voicing your concerns that you too do need boundaries. Or you need to be allowed to go out and be with friends and similar: - Describe what the problem is you want to bring up. And use it with clear language. ""I want to talk to you about my need to go out bowling every second saturday""  - Express how this is important to you, tell her your feelings. ""This is important to me, because I feel that it would help me relieve my stress."" - Assert. Don't beat around the bush, be clear about what it is that you feel and think.  - Reinforce : Explain how this will benefit the both of you. Focus on the positive aspects if possible.  - Mindful: Don't get distracted and allow the conversation to change focus. Stay firm on the topic, repeat if nesseccery the original problem and how it makes you feel without accusing her of anything.  - Appear Confident: Be sure of what it is you want. Try to avoid saying sentences like ""maybe it's not a good idea..."" which will make it possible for them to convince you that you don't need it. Use your body language relaxed but persuasive - don't crouch away. Keep eye contact.  - Negotiate: Be willing to compromise, the most important part is to find a sollution that works for both sides. Don't put the entire responsibility of the problem onto yourself, but ask for alternative sollutions ""If you feel Saturday is a bad day, maybe Tuesday after work is better, what do you think?"" or ""How do you think we should solve this problem?"" I'm suggesting this one in particular because it can help you set boundaries with people as well. To say no, or inform that the situation isn't working out for you, and together you'll have to find a different sollution. It's hard, I don't manage to do all the steps. But the first two ones are my favourite. Another skill is the skill called STOP. It has 4 steps. And is handy in the middle of a confrontation or a fight, where you feel you're losing control over what you're actually saying. 1. Stop. Don't react, don't move. You're emotions are attempting to control you. 2. Take a step backwards: Take a break from the argument, breathe. You could say ""I just need a moment."" ""Give me a moment to think on this""3. Observe: Notice what's happening around you and inside of you. What is the situation? What is your thoughts and emotions? What's the other person really saying? What's the facts here?4. Plan with mindfulness: Decide what to do, what you can bear in mind both to your own thoughts and emotions and others. What is your goal in this situation? What can you do to improve the situation? And the last tip is simply to ask for more time when considering something rather than saying yes straight away. I also struggle with setting boundaries. It's really hard to practice saying no. And finding out when I actually can say No without damaging the relationship I have to others, and when Yes is okay. And when I can say yes, but need to change the timetable. I'm suggesting this because it does seem like a part of you want to keep being in a relationship with your partner, and maybe talking it over with her before you make any desicion might be smart. Just remember to have these conversations when both of you aren't highly emotional. When activated and highly emotional it is difficult to think straight. Other than that, I just want to say welcome to the forum. And I hope you can find some help and guidance here!"

425,"Thank you so much, there's a lot of really helpful stuff there.  And thanks for welcoming me, that means a lot.  It's good to be here.  Dave"
426,"It's so strange to be in the position of the ""listener"" or ""witness"" to an other's pain.  It is especially difficult when you're unsure how much of your own experience to share.  In my job, I came to meet a young gal whose family is completely dysfunctional.  She was in inpatient treatment and is now in outpatient treatment--all while trying to finish high school.  On the one hand, it's so cool to see a young person with so much insight and understanding in regard to the dysfunctional system she's imprisoned by.  As awful as it is, I can see how she's used it to empower herself.  On the other hand, it's so very painful not to be able to affect change.  It's so difficult to witness the pain of an other who simply wants to experience the unconditional love of a parent, but gets nothing but criticism, lack of support, and false accusations.   My heart hurts for this girl.  Yet, I can't help but be impressed by the fierceness of her Spirit.  She amazes me.  But I worry that I will not be able to show HER that fierceness within her and let her really, deeply know her own power.  I so desire to somehow let her see that energy, that power that will take her so very far beyond from where she came."
427,"kat, i think just by working  with her you're showing her a lot.  if a situation presents itself as a lead-in to some personal revealing that you feel comfortable with, i think you'll know it.  the fact that you're concerned about it tells me that you're a wonderful role model for her - your own compassion, determination, grit, and caring will shine through.it's the best to see young people make their way out, and what a wonderful feeling to be able to help them do so.  big hug!!!"
428,"Don't underestemate the power of support.  Just being there is a huge validation of a person's worth.  It is wonderful that she is in an outpatient program with professionals that can help her learn the only person she can change is herself.  When I was in high school, I was removed from my home.  I had one teacher who was super supportive.  She didn't try to fix anything, she never claimed to be able to change the situation, but she was there for me.  To this day I am filled with love when I think of her.  She would listen to me, give me hugs, and validate me.  That was irreplaceable."
429,"It almost sounds like you want so much to validate her, but are yourself afraid you might be misunderstood. So it feels like a stretch. Maybe you could still reach out, though? The chances are both of you would benefit from sharing what is so hard to come by in this world--human compassion.She may indeed be as strong as you indicate, but strength needs a boost now and then, too; or it weakens entirely and hope goes out the window. I'm not implying your expressing support more directly would be the precise boost she needs, but on the other hand if you didn't and it was obvious she needed help 'after the fact' it might have a boomerang effect on your own feelings. I've been on both sides of this--desperately needing someone to help in even the smallest way and also regretting not having done what I could for someone else (partly due to my fear that what I could offer was never good enough).I don't know; I'm not in the situation, or know what steps you can take to get to her. But strong as she appears, she could be craving that someone like yourself can be there for and with her, and in turn she might be able to help you."
430,"Listening, paraphrasing and validating make a huge difference, Kat.  Good for you!"
431,"I feel so alone. I can't stand it! I'm estranged from my parents and sister because of family violence and my mother not protecting me but staying with my father. I had a longterm psychologist who I adored and she was the first person I began to trust and then she hurt me emotionally, really badly. I have a big wall up all the time and trust terrifies me. I feel SO alone and have so much fear, grief and anger inside me but I have been so hurt by people that I'm terrified of them and at the same time I need them so much. Its a catch 22. I need help! I'm not working cos of the CPTSD. I worked my * off through my twenties and thirties. Now everything has fallen apart. I'm in financial hardship with no safety net, no one to help me. The world is a really frightening and mean place."
432,"I can relate. The world can indeed be frightening. You say you worked your * off thru your twenties and thirties, so I take it your CPTSD symptoms didn't get crippling until after your thirties. Is there some way you can get back to the emotional condition you were in back then? Please forgive me for being so blunt, but it seems to me you are really stuck and unless you can reach out for more help and accept it, you will remain stuck. If you're too afraid of people, can you read a book, for example anything by Pete Walker?  http://pete-walker.comPlease believe that I care about you."
433,"Three Roses, I've just been incredibly hurt by the one person I was learning to trust and who I reached out to for help. So unfortunately its not as simple as 'reach out for more help and accept it'. Also as is well known with CPTSD, being able to accept help and feel supported by people can be impossible for some people. When I was working so hard in my 20's and 30's I was surviving and very disconnected from my emotions. That is not a place I want to return to. I'm trying to avoid being disconnected to my feelings and returning to work too soon would only add to my issues. Thanks for noticing I am stuck. Indeed I am, but just telling me to reach out and accept help.....is not helpful. I have been reaching out so much over the last 2 years and continue to do so. I reach out on here and accept the support I'm offered. What does help, is compassion, understanding, kindness and encouragement, not judgement."
434,"Please forgive my inability to adequately express what I mean. I usually have a rough time with language, being a visual thinker. Hard to translate at times. I know all about being stuck. I am there currently. A friend finally convinced me to find a new therapist. All the others had hurt or been less than unhelpful. One told me all my problems were because I wasn't agreeable enough. Another one didn't believe me about the severity of abuse I'd been thru. One thought if my husband and I spent time hugging every day in a non sexual manner, that would cure me. This therapist is about my 9th one. I do have trouble opening up to him but I find that when I do, when I work on looking at things the way he suggests, it is helping. "
435," What is it that you feel you need right now, right here?  How can we help?  I've been working with the same therapist for over a decade now.  If she did the same thing to me that you psychologist did to you, I don't know how I would cope.  I would be devastated for sure.  I can't even imagine what it's like for you.  I have to believe, though, that it will somehow get better for  you.  I can't accept that this would somehow be it and that you'd be left to suffer alone.  Right now you're not ready to try a new therapist which is completely understandable, but could you at least leave a space open in your heart and mind for that possibility at some time in the future?  The world is a really frightening and mean place, and it is also a beautiful, merciful place.  I understand if you can't believe that right now.  I truly hope you find some relief from the pain and that the connections you are making here are helpful and ease the loneliness a bit.  I'd love to give you a big hug if you'd like it..."
436,"Hi Kat, thanks for your post. I dreamt about her last night. It hurts more than I can feel on my own. Its like my heart is being crushed and I can't breathe. Its too painful. I honestly don't know what to do. I've tried so many other psychologists here and either they reject me or theres something really off about them and they are not safe. I need my psychologist back but she's behaving so badly. I can't force her to talk to me. We became really close, under her guidance and then when I started to disagree with her about things and assert my own ideas she didn't like that at all. She gave me the love I never had from my mum but have desperately craved my whole life. I need HER. It was an unsafe termination of therapy and I am absolutely devastated and I need help! I am alone and I don't know what to do!!!"
437,"Hi Deb - I am so sorry for what you went through with your T.  I may have already mentioned this in another thread in response to one of your other posts about this, but just in case I didn't there is an organization called ""Surviving Therapist Abuse"" that you could contact and perhaps find out what if anything can/should be done (e.g., report the T, find help for yourself). Here's the link - http://www.survivingtherapistabuse.com/.Kizzie"
438,"Hi Kizzie,Thanks for that link, I appreciate it. I don't think you'd mentioned it before. I'll have a look. At the moment, I am not ready to do that, I need more support and stability within myself first before I face what would be a very painful and distressing process.Deb"

441,I never had one.  It sounds like a beautiful thing.
442,"At the direction of another book i read many years ago (Adult Children of Abusive Parents by Stephen Farmer), I created an internal mother. you can choose any one to make into an internal mother or father, but for the image I chose my actual mother, and how she would have been if she'd not had any damage in her own life. The book is from 1990 but it's still relevant and useful. https://www.amazon.com/Adult-Children-Abusive-Parents-Emotionally/dp/0345363884  There are used copies for as little as just over $1. "
443,"I think my M might have been BPD, Witch type rather than NPD. But pretty messed up and not able to parent well anyway. There were other women in my life when I was growing up who were willing/able to give me some of what I was missing. But they weren't always that healthy either. That's the downside. e.g. maternal GM might even have been NPD herself, but I didn't suffer under her the way my M did. The whole family dynamic did though. My other GM tried to help me a lot e.g. to believe in myself, but I was too far gone by the time she tried for it to help much. Also both she and a great-aunt who helped me later when I was a young adult were both of the opinion that they knew when my problems were over and that I was to forget about them, get over them, 'throw them out' and get on with life. Well, they were just plain wrong. But it took me a long time to really believe that my own opinion held more sway in that regard. So I went from over-dependence on parents to over-dependence on other family members without learning about my own opinions and learning to trust them. If that makes sense. Maybe I wouldn't have survived at all without these three women in my life, but it wasn't exactly perfect either. I feel as if I'm babbling a bit or not writing quite on topic. "
444,"Quote from: Sunrise on August 17, 2017, 06:41:05 AMIf you had/have a nm, did you find a nurturing, warm figure elsewhere? As an adult I spontaneously found three. They were all very different women.At 23 I found number one.  I still had LC with my mother.  Number one was a deeply spiritual person -- she'd had a NDE before we met -- AND I once showed up to her place to find her naked on the floor with a whisky bottle at her side, headphones on and singing dreadfully.  What can I say? She was brilliant.  Why?  Because she loved me.  She told it like it was, brilliant feedback, but the hardest things didn't feel like criticism.  Lots of hugs.  She was my mother's age. She told me she considered me her daughter.At 30 I moved in next door to number two.  I'd moved as far from FOO as I could without actually leaving the country but still had phone and mail contacts, and visited their town in my holidays.  Number two had a blind spot about me.  I could do no wrong.  She was my biggest fan.   What can I say? She was brilliant.  Why?  Because she loved me. Hugs whenever something went wrong for me. She had about a full decade on my mother. She told me she considered me her daughter.At 41 I met number three.  Technically I was NC with mother as well as on the other side of the world.  She stopped me on the street because I was carrying a box, to enquire whether I knew anything about her missing tortoises.  In the box I had a tortoise I'd just bought -- from a pet shop, not some rogue in a pub.  Her tortoises had been stolen and she knew it.  I was editor of the local paper so the story + photo of said tortoises made the front page.   They were never recovered, but number three and I remained friends due to common interest.  She had no children and wasn't the hugging type.  She was so earnest she was funny. Neither she nor I would ever have said ""I love you"", but it was there anyway.  She too was older than my mother.Two and three are both dead but still loved and talked to, in my head.  Regrettably, number one and I lost contact when I was 58, ie. 35 years after we met.   We were both in bad shape at the time and we both changed addresses.  Because of the way she was, I believe she would have found me if she was still alive.  As it is, I expect her to appear to me when the time is right.Thank you, Sunrise, for this question.  "
445,"This post has been moved from Blueberry's Loyalty thread. I set out to demonstrate that I understood her situation -- and discovered I had a lot to get off my chest. How come I have no FOO and precious few extended family members? Here's why:Mother and one sister smear-campaign pre-emptively, ie. telling whoppers to anyone they think I might talk to about them. As one hideous example out of many, I reconnected with an aunt (Mother's sister) when I returned to my birthplace from Australia. Blow me, almost the first thing out of Aunt's mouth was: ""[Mother] doesn't know why you're not talking to them. She thinks it's because they took you out of [the school I attended in England until we migrated].""I was floored. Speechless. Flabbergasted.I had gone NC with Mother (and by extension, my dad) right after The Most Horrible Event -- the so-called 'mediation' that turned my hair white in a matter of weeks. There'd been no mention that day of our migration 22 years earlier, much less of my old school. Migration was indeed a traumatic time for me, losing familiar town, extended family, friends, pets... but even at 13 I knew it was what my father considered best for the family. Desperately homesick as I was, I never made a murmur about something my parents, my elder sister and I were all going through at the same time. In order to preserve her reputation, Mother had chosen to make me look like a petty, grudge-holding, spoiled brat. I was over 40 and had a good career when, having heard I was going back to the town where Aunt lived, she came up with this 'theory'. The Most Horrible Event had occurred when I was 35. I can still get steamed up   knowing this kind of thing has been spread around the extended family -- and that they believe it. Of course they do. Mother started letting them know I was ""difficult"" before I could speak. Poor Mother, she's had so much to contend with, and all of it came from me.I've never once talked smack about any family member. I've never defended myself. After Aunt's bombshell I said: ""Mother knows exactly what she did"" and left it at that. It was a miracle I could say anything at all.I'm convinced nothing I can say or do will redeem this caricature of me in the minds of extended family members.  The mircale is I no longer care. Fawning is horrible, makes matters worse. I no longer approach them, but if they approach me they get the current version: largely healed since NC with all FOO. It wouldn't have been my choice, but that's how it is -- and I now see it was a good thing. All three of my siblings came to me when they hit a crisis Elder Sis was first, and I can see I was the only person she could have come to. As teenagers we were best friends as well as sisters, and I know there's still a lot of love between us. She abandoned me for her own mental health when I was at my lowest ebb.Younger Sis was next. She cost me time off work and money I couldn't afford, then dumped me as soon as her trouble was sorted out. Her subsequent collaboration with Mother led to my first psych hospital admission.  (She managed the second on her own, and via the internet.)GCbro came last. He was still living with our parents and I was at the other end of Australia. I'd flown to their city for his 21st party, after which he told me he was gay. For about a year afterwards I put two letters (no email back then) in each envelope to him: one he could show Mother (because he had to ) and one acknowledging his excitement over each new potential mate he was meeting. ""The two clever ones"" had a great relationship until my last contact with him, which hurt and saddened me. I had the gall to say so in writing, and he promptly dropped me as well,Where I am todayIt's taken me a very long time to deal with this, squirming when new contacts want to know about family. I know how to handle that now. I know where all FOO members are and, broadly speaking, what they're doing. Most people stop at that. If it goes further, I'm happy to say I haven't seen Whoever for years. The final line, if necessary, is ""I'm not comfortable talking about this"" -- and I can sit through the silence that follows. Anyone who pushed the point would be crossing the line into the red zone; hasn't happened yet and seems unlikely, but would definitely and the friendship.Sticking to the facts is the key.I've always loved all my FOO members and I always will.  Dad is gone. He was more of a support to me than the others knew. Mother and Younger Sis ... I can genuinely wish them well now with the hideous problems they have.  No longer any anger whatsoever towards ElderSis and GCbro. I was homeless, jobless and entirely on my own when they stopped contacting me, and I went into the too-hard basket. After all, they grew up in the same dysfunctional family as I did.This sounds sad, but isn't. I can love from a distance and it feels so much better than the grief and rage I carried for so long. I still get sad and angry, but I can self-soothe out of it. Distance is another major key. I needed a lot of geographical distance, was always on the run and made a mess of people's address books (they told me so). I don't let myself dwell on the harm that did to career, finances and relationships; I had a lot of adventures. Getting right away from FOO helped a lot, but a far bigger factor was distancing them in my head. If there's any interest in that I'll elaborate, but this post is already too long.Pre-emptive smear campaigning started early for a lot of us, and I know how damned hard it is to shut it out while we're struggling with self-esteem.  I want people to know it isn't the life sentence it seems. "
446,Words fail me so 
447,"Thanks, Three Roses.  A post of yours about your niece (?) helped me articulate the 'loving from a distance' bit. "
448,"Hi Candid,I was interested to read your thread, and glad you put it in a thread of its own, so you could do it justice. You mentioned that if there was any interest in how you managed to 'distance them in your head' that you'd elaborate - I would be interested to know how you did that, because I find that I ruminate all too often about my FOO, and often 'can't distance them in my head'.  So if you're still ok to write more, I'd be interested to hear how you have tackled that part.  Thanks in advance  But for me, the frequency and amount of time spent ruminating has got better over time, so I guess it is better than it was.Hope  "
449,"Hi Hope,I did something today in therapy which stopped the ruminations right away. I don't do EMDR, I put emotions, memories etc on a screen. Well, today T suggested that I put the words and voice of one of my abusers on the screen. Lo and behold, the disturbing sentence disappeared and I was left looking at an old woman who has no relevance in the particular issue whatsoever! I don't think my T had been expecting such a big and quick change, but it worked! Don't know if that makes sense to you.Maybe Candid can tell us more. "
450,"Hi Blueberry,That makes sense, and thanks for that suggestion - I shall certainly try it out.  Thank you!  Glad it helped you - and was such a quick effect.Hope  "
451,"Quote from: Hope66 on August 15, 2017, 02:43:47 PMBut for me, the frequency and amount of time spent ruminating has got better over time, so I guess it is better than it was.  It took decades for me, Hope. It's only in the past couple of years that I realised I needed to get them out of my head.  It's not that we forget what went on or stop thinking about them -- witness my posts here -- but that we've challenged what they said about us, and we realise that because of their own thoughts about us, they will never know Who We Are.  That's their loss, right?  Thinking about them is fine. Letting them speak in our heads is also sort-of okay, as long as we guard against believing it. IMO the only reason we have them in our heads post-NC is because we love them.  I keep in mind that that makes me a good and loving person.  I didn't go NC with Mother because I hated her; I did it for my own sanity.  My biggest regret in life is organising that family 'mediation'. I did it for GCbro, but that's another story.  My hair colour segued from 35 to 80 almost overnight; and the aftermath was the closest I've ever come to suicide. It can also be said that I needed Mother to expose herself in front of witnesses before I would accept that I had no choice but NC with her.  It was no longer 'just me'.  Someone else was aghast that any mother could speak that way to and about her own child; and that ElderSis demanded a private audience with the mediators so she could dish the dirt without me hearing it.  Unfortunately that validation didn't come until I fled to therapy and the T suggested I contact the mediation centre.  It would have saved my hair and months of agony to have heard it on the day or soon afterwards without having to ask for it.I've had a lot of validation IRL. If I catch myself ruminating on what Mother taught me about myself, I STOP! and think of the people presently in my life who love me and show it.  They know the Candid my mother never knew and never can know.  The beauty of this is the enormous impact it has on how I think about myself.  For me, it's not enough to stop them speaking in our heads.  We also have to work on self-image.  My trauma isn't so much about what they said and did as about having to cut off the people I love.  I truly award myself a gold medal for what that says about me.Quote from: Blueberry on August 15, 2017, 02:56:48 PMT suggested that I put the words and voice of one of my abusers on the screen.

452,"Hi Candid,I really appreciate this response and it's really helpful to hear what you said.  Thank you.  I am incorporating the suggestions that you and Blueberry have given me - and I feel it will help me a lot.Having validation from people who understand, it's a precious thing.Hope  "

454,"Quote from: Hope66 on August 16, 2017, 10:28:13 AMHaving validation from people who understand, it's a precious thing.As far as I know it's the only thing that will eventually stop us thinking we must be horrible people -- so horrible that our own mothers recoiled.  When it starts as young as it did for me, what could I possibly have done to make her so vicious towards me?  The adult me understands it was her problem, but we all know about blaming the children we were for not knowing what we know now. And so it goes on. People with good-enough parents self-validate automatically. They literally can't understand why it's an issue for us, and they'll show their impatience. We have to learn it, but first we have to unlearn the auto-reject when other people say good things about us. You know how it goes. What do they want? Are they being sarcastic? Are they laughing at me?  IMO it's impossible for us to self-validate until we've actually been able to hear and absorb the good things other people say. More than one of my early boyfriends was able to tell me where I was going wrong, but of course they couldn't tell me why.  It took my first therapist to pinpoint Mother, and with hindsight I know she spotted it at the intake interview. She knew exactly where she was taking me.  She made it explicit about week 3 of 6; it was 'crisis' counselling.  I had permission to call her between sessions, and that was the only time I did.  I was hysterical. She calmed me down, reassured me, said ""see you next week"".  So I walked in next time all cover-up bravado, and said: ""I'm so sorry about that. I don't know what happened.""She said: ""You lost your mother last week. That's what happened."" If only it had been that easy!  I was 26.  I'd been dutifully attending weekly dinners at my parents' home.  A digression here:QuoteI was already geographically removed from their town, ""for work reasons"".  Every week my father collected me from the train station; after the one occasion on which my train was late I had to call him first then wait about 20 minutes for him.  They complained because I held up dinner.  Father was ready to drive me home soon afterwards.  And every week, according to ElderSis, he walked back in shaking his head and saying: ""That girl drinks too much.""  Yeah. I did. Dad was very liberal with the booze.  Don't know how many weeks he held up an empty, grinning, and said: ""Old Candid's finished another bottle."" Like it was a joke.I couldn't face the Thursday nights, called my parents to say so some time during that six weeks.  Then I had new problems: mostly Dad calling me to say Why aren't you coming? You've upset your mother.  Mother called at least once.  She was angry, venomous.That was the least of it. The pre-emptive smear campaigning began. She knew the secret was out, and who knew what I might say?  I still don't know how she got in the ear of a woman I worked with, but she led with her worst. It was another eight years of LC until the 'mediation', after which I went NC with Mother.  Then the general smear-campaigning in the extended family became apparent. I'd been a ""difficult"" toddler.  From my side, it was endless attempts to get mother to like me.  I already knew she didn't.How's ElderSis?Oh, she's an angel. Mummy's little helper.And Candid?QuoteEven though ElderSis has three years on me, she was bathed first and I had her bathwater afterwards. She was always clean, I was always dirty.  It's possible this became objectively true as each of us struggled to be what Mother wanted.  ElderSis was perpetually ""ill"" because Mother wanted to play nurse with her.  Me? She would give a rueful shake of the head and tell me: ""Should have been a boy.""I know, Ma.  That would have been perfect.  That's what you wanted.  I get it.  I did my best.I still have a reputation in the extended family for ""making a scene"" even though I've never actually made one.  I know this resonates with Blueberry, too.  Having been on the other side of the world from most relatives for decades, I'm far more likely to annoy them with fawning behaviours and general awkwardness.  I missed my cousin's wedding because my parents were holidaying here and I would ""make a scene"". (I probably wouldn't have gone.  It would have been a tough call.  I don't know -- but it would have been nice to have been invited.)  While H and I were separated he was told he couldn't attend my aunt's funeral as he wanted to, again because I would ""make a scene"".  My parents were 12,000 miles away but my reputation had stuck. Yes folks, I'm hare-trigger set to start hysterically yelling expletives at a funeral. Fight all this while crippled with self-doubt and fawning behaviours that turn everyone off? Impossible. Run, Candid, run -- and keep running. More than 40 addresses in 60 years, three countries and seven towns, not counting travel and Other People's Spare Rooms. As the saying goes, you still have to live with yourself. Or not -- an idea considered many times but now completely out of the question.I am not the person she said I was... and finally, gloriously, I know it.  I'm home -- not geographically, because obviously nowhere is home to me. The tortoise is my symbol.  No one I know can roam so freely, pack so efficiently, settle so quickly.  True, my shell is battle-scarred.  I'm a visual offence and I don't care (I used to care a lot.)  People delight in my company.  I delight in my own company.No reputation-repair necessary.  Blood relatives of Mother's see what they expect to see.  One of them delivers trite little homilies, the kind of stuff you see in greeting cards. The pampered pussycat can claw at the tortoise all it likes; this tortoise smiles, says ""yeah"", and ambles on untouched.  I get on fine with the extended family. Really, no one but me is interested in my inner world.  It's my little secret."
455,"Hi everyone. This is my first post here. I'm sorry for what all of you have gone through and hope you are finding the peace you deserve.I'm the spouse of someone that I believe has CPTSD, but he SEEMS to have little self-awareness of himself at the moment. I'm not ready to tell my whole story, but here's what I know about my husband. We've been married 17 years and during our first year of marriage he had a very nervous personality. He would flail his arms around in his sleep as if he was fighting off an attacker. He finally told me that he was acting this way because his father (who was an opium addict) used to beat him. Actually what he described in some cases was more like torture. His father beat his mother too. He told me he was a troublemaker child and that is why his father beat him. He said he was never ever happy during his childhood. He told me at the age of 16 he stood up to his father and told him if he didn't stop beating his mother, he would kill him with his own hands, and his father stopped. He almost seemed like he had a mild case of manic depression the first 5 years of our marriage and then things got better and better until he seemed pretty normal.Then about a year and a half ago everything started to change. We made a long planned move to his hometown and moved in with his mother (his father died about 7-8 years ago). His career though really has taken off since then and he is having success he never had before (he's a doctor). At the same time, he is studying for his master's exams.As I said, I'm not ready to go into all the details of his symptoms but suffice it to say his behavior has become what appears to be a classic case of CPTSD. I've learned more about his childhood from talking to his sister who is close in age to him and his mother. His father beat him because he wanted to play soccer and things like that and his father wanted him to study. I know he credits his father with encouraging him to study and become a doctor but i did not realize the abuse was related to his studies until his sister told me. His mother has also confirmed that much of his behavior right now is just like his father (he even sometimes goes into what can be described as trances where he speaks in his father's voice and his native language and cannot understand English). He also often behaves like he has returned to his childhood and lately has been using a tone of voice that he admitted to me he used when he was 8-9 years old (I noted I had only heard him use it since a month prior and he said I wasn't paying attention because he had been doing it for 3 months!)However, here's the problem I face. Compared to when we were first married and he clearly could see and admitted the connection between his behavior toward me and his childhood abuse, now at least outwardly he does not admit there to be any connection. I'm the one who changes, I'm the one who is crazy, psychotic, sick in my head. (He says these things sometimes). What I have clearly observed is that his aggressive and controlling behavior is at its worst when his mother is present and the topic of conversation is food or it is meal time. I have ascertained from him and his mother that he never had any shortage of food as a child, even though he grew up poor. He always told me they had plenty of meat and dairy products as they had their own animals and even some land to grow food and his mother confirmed his pockets were always full of sweets. She did say his father was very abusive toward her at the table (not the children) and that he was acting like his father, only his father was worse.At one point I gave up eating with them because it was creating more problems between us. He kept pressing me as to why I was doing this and one day he was pressing me and finally I said, ""Stop worrying about what I eat, where I eat, or who I eat with. Worry about something important, like your exams."" What struck me was as soon as I said that, he shot up from sitting like a rocket, said, ""You are right"" and left the room. I realized I had touched upon something, namely that telling him he needed to study resulted in an overly compliant response. He uses his exams as an excuse to avoid me, even sometimes I find out later he was not studying. He was a student studying before at other points in our marriage and he did not act like this, but then his mother wasn't in the picture.My feeling is that the combination of living with his mother and studying for exams has created the perfect storm of a trigger for him that has catapaulted him back into his childhood. However, unlike when we were first married, there is no acknowledgement from him about this. I did point out one day that food and his mother seemed to be a trigger and he got angry, started avoiding me and his mother and particularly has reduced interaction with his mother compared to before and is actually now starting to behave better at meals, although many times he just sits silently at meals.The long and the short of it is though that I do not sense any real sense of admittedly connecting his childhood with a lot of bad behavior he is engaging in (there's a lot more I haven't talked about above) like he did in the beginning of our marriage. He is suffering from complete emotional numbing. Tells me he loves no one and that if he could feel he would wish he was dead. When I say nice things to him like how much I love him and care about him, he gets a very pained look on his face, like he has constipation and someone stuffed a bitter lemon in his mouth. He is convinced his behavior is the real him and that he wasn't himself before. He's obsessed with wanting to feel in control, before he was happy to share decision making with me. As you can see, a lot of classic CPTSD symptoms.I guess I want to ask all of you who have CPTSD, how did you come to realize 1-that something was wrong, 2-that is was connected to your childhood, 3-got a diagnosis of CPTSD? The lack of self-awareness (or acknowledgement) on his part is a huge problem because he is engaging in a lot of destructive behaviors that could have lifelong consequences for multiple people if not nipped in the bud sooner rather than later. I'm just wondering how the awareness grows inside you and the dos and don'ts from my end of helping him to cultivate an awareness."
456,"First of all, welcome!  I think it's great that you've come here to ask your important questions.  I'm not sure how much help I can offer, but I'll give it a try. As someone with CPTSD, I'll give you my answers to your three questions.  1) I always suspected something was wrong in my family, my mother was finally diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder, but it wasn't until I heard her diagnosis from a family therapist that I realized something was also wrong with me.  I was 31 and it kind of flipped my world upside down to realize all I had known to be ""normal"" was far from it.  I remember thinking: Hmm...so maybe that's why I'm always angry and drink until I pass out most nights and self-mutilate.  (I know, it sounds funny not to have recognized these behaviors as problems before then.)  2) I think I already answered this in #1.  It just really hit me that the way I was raised was dysfunctional and had to have affected me.  There was no way, in my mind, that it could not have negatively affected me.  (My older sisters all completely disagree, however.)  3) I entered individual therapy shortly after completing family therapy.  I was first diagnosed with early on-set dysthymic disorder--low-grade perpetual depression starting before the age of 21.  Then it was chronic major depressive disorder.  Then it evolved to a non-specific dissociative disorder.  Finally, the term C-PTSD was used.  The first diagnosis was from my first therapist.  The other three all came from my current T who I've been seeing for over a decade.  I suspect she always knew I was suffering from CPTSD and the associated dissociative disorder, but waited until I was ready to accept it for myself before broaching those diagnoses.  Plus, CPTSD isn't an official, recognized disorder by the DSM, so she may have been apprehensive of naming it as such.  One thing I hope you noticed was that while I can see how my childhood has negatively affected me and caused problems, my two oldest sisters are in complete denial.  In their eyes my parents were perfect and neither of them has any problems.  Ha!I think maybe the story of my husband might be a bit more helpful...maybe.My husband was born in another country.  His family fled and ended up here in the U.S. when he was about seven.  I mention this because you mentioned your husband going into trances where he speaks in his native language and doesn't understand English.  You also spoke about him being brought up poor, but not lacking for food.  For my husband's family, and the family of my brother-in-law whose parents were both immigrants and struggled with money, the one thing that was not skimped on was food.  I think food is such a vital part of culture and identity that it is the one non-negotiable.  It's like these families would go without almost anything just so that they could provide the food they knew and which named them.  I hope that makes sense. My husband's father was very abusive.  My husband is the youngest for four boys and claims he was never beaten, but his brothers sure were.  The story goes that the father didn't beat his wife...at first.  Once that started, they separated.  The father became delusional (possibly due to syphilis) and ended up shooting my husband's oldest brother, mother, and maternal grandmother.  Only the mother died.  My husband was only fourteen.When we first met, as we were falling asleep, my husband would do that whole-body jerk that happens when you have a dream that you're falling. He did it EVERY night.  He also would cry out in his sleep and beg his father no or become very little.  Once he spoke in a very little voice in his sleep about a lollipop.  At the time, I think he knew how he'd grown up was negatively affecting him.  As the years have progressed, however, he doesn't see anything wrong with his current maladaptive behaviors.  He's not curious about knowing how his childhood still affects him.Just this evening, we went to the beach and stayed until after dark.  Unbeknownst to me, he'd put his wallet and car keys in a pouch on the back of my beach chair.  When I closed it up, they fell out.  We didn't realize any of this until we were back at the car.  He FLIPPED OUT.  His MO is to blame others.  That's what had always saved him from being beaten as a kid.  He does it any time he ""messes"" up.  If he breaks a glass, it is because someone else put it in the wrong place.   He became furious and blamed me for dropping everything in the sand even though I had no idea he'd put anything in my beach chair.  He yelled at our daughter for having to use the bathroom.  He yelled at our son for having wanted to go to the beach in the first place.  He was out of control.  But, he didn't see any of it.  And he won't.  He did apologize because I was over-the-top with my explanations to the kids that they'd done nothing wrong and that the correct way to deal with such a situation was to have a plan, keep calm, and execute the plan.  When I walked almost directly to where his dropped things were, he melted and apologized.  He could see, only then, that he'd over-reacted.  But I highly, highly doubt he'd ever associate any of his behaviors with his childhood coping mechanisms.  I know this doesn't help solve your problems.  My hope is that your husband doesn't remain in denial, but the denial can run very deep.  It absolutely sounds like your husband is suffering from CPTSD, but there's no guarantee he's capable of seeing it.  Probably not what you were hoping to hear and quite possibly me projecting my own family issues onto yours.  Keep reading.  Keep talking to your husband.  Keep seeking answers.  I wish you the best.

457,"Hi AnchorintheStorm,If your husband is being abusive it doesn't matter why.  That is the bigggest problem I see here.  Your husband suffered abuse and now you are suffering abuse, yet your focus is helping him with his suffering.  Abuse is often, perhaps always a consequence of experience of abuse.  The problem is that abuse is a sick solution, it is taking feeling powerless, humiliated, hurt etc. and dumping them on someone else, so they suffer instead of you.  Your suffering matters to me.  If you have children, they are being harmed too.  I feel for you, wanting to provide the love that your husband was denied, wanting to make it better for him.  My opinion, you can't.  Your husband has solved his problem."
458,"Kat-I do see a lot of similarities between our husbands. The thing that gets me is during the first year in our marriage, my husband, on his own, made the connection between his father's abuse and the way he was acting toward me at the time. He had a good self-awareness and I don't think if he had not told me, I would be able to show him the compassion and patience and understanding I feel right now, because otherwise his behavior would be totally inexplicable.Radical-As for my husband's abusive behavior, at first as this all was starting last year I was giving him a pass, but with time I gained the strength to stand up to him and it HAS helped calm him down and he is a lot less abusive toward me since I did that. I have been very firm in drawing boundaries with him and I have seen good progress from him when I do so.  There's more to the story than I am willing to get into right now but it's clear he internalized his father's view of him as a ""nasty"" person (his own word to describe himself) and doesn't want to actually take out his self-perceived nastiness on me. I can see this in his actions and he has even stated it to me several times.But that is also part of the reason he is distancing himself from me. He believes the more time he is with me then more likely he is to be abusive toward me and he wants to protect me from that. Early in our marriage we did have quite a bit of turmoil but the last few years our relationship was quite normal with very little fighting, maybe every few days we might have a small fight, stay angry for five minutes, and then move on, totally healthy interaction. He basically had become pretty adept at behaving normally. But his memory right now only is of the early years it seems and he is convinced that his issues are with ME, and does not seem to recognize the role of his father as he did early on, nor the influence of his mother's presence, although I have pointed this out to him several times, because it is glaringly obvious. He can be totally normal and nice when we are alone but get his mother in the room and some food and he becomes a mocking, controlling, rude jerk.I know I can't solve his problems for him, but it is frustrating that early in our marriage he understood himself and could see the problems were NOT between us but rather stemmed from his upbringing but now he wants to blame all the problems on our relationship, but it is more clear than ever that the environment he is in and the current circumstances that are related to his childhood are what is causing him so much turmoil at the moment, but he doesn't see that at all, or at least he does not acknowledge it to me. And he basically just says after all these years I don't know his personality. His exams will be over in November and I am hoping that this will remove one huge trigger but his mother is here to stay.  His behavior toward her is not so good either, but she just says he's like his father and puts up with it, which doesn't help because it is tacitly saying it is ok I'm the one standing up and saying ""I know you are capable of acting better than this,"" because truly, I know he is. And when I do stand up to him it can push him back into being a mature and respectful adult for a while. He becomes more himself, or at least the self I have known for many years, not under the sway of his childhood. In fact, after taking a very firm stand against him when he was acting like his father several times (and he was acting like his father toward others as well, not just me), he stopped going into those trances like his father with everyone, so there has been progress on that front. He is aware of that progress and has told me he notices he is acting better and is proud of that fact, but chalks it up to spending less time with me and believes us spending time together is the problem, although his time with me has neither decreased or increased since the time he was acting like that frequently. He has a very bad sense of time at the moment by the way and cannot accurately say how much time he spends with me AT ALL. He believes it is way more than it is.I do believe he knows there is something wrong with himself, as he engages in a lot of projection and defensive comments that if I turn them around in my mind, apply to him, but making the connection with the source of it seems to be totally lost."
459,"Quote from: 3:45 on August 13, 2017, 10:08:23 AMI use a different voice - it exaggerates in situations where I need to win; arguing my method of doing a chore is better, discussing politics etc. I hate thinking I mimic his persuasive techniques, even over relatively trivial things. I become defensive when people ask how I picked up my accent (I dont sound like the locals and Ive lived here all my life). I hear myself and understand I am different and I know why. But I cant trust that others would understand its not a conscious choice.When my husband first started acting strangely, I came to the conclusion he was having a midlife crisis. I still 100% believe that because he fits all the typical symptoms to a T but I also see a great deal of it is CPTSD. From what I have learned about midlife crisis, the different voices are him returning to earlier stages of his life when he had issues and/or acting out the abuser role (i.e. his father). He started school at age 8 (there was no school open here before then and he started off in 3rd grade) and I suspect that is when the abuse may have started. It's interesting that you realize what you are doing, I was really gobsmacked when he said he had been using the 8 year old voice for 3 months. He HADN'T been using it that long, but he obviously was aware that he had started it in the near past when I told him he never used it before. He told me he used to say ""Mommy mommy"" in that voice (he uses it to call me as well) and I asked him if he used it when he needed something from her. He went silent at that point. Quote from: 3:45 on August 13, 2017, 10:08:23 AM It seems your husband told you parts of the story but not all. It is great that you have connected the dots this far and sought advice from this forum. I hope you continue seeking advice and also that you look after yourself because there seems to be many demands on you.No it's clear he hasn't. 97% of his stories from his childhood involve animals, not people, and he is an endless source of animal stories-wild, stray, pets, farm animals-you name it, his mind is a virtual zoo. I even asked him a few months ago if he spent all his time with animals as a child and he said yes! Although I know he had friends. He has only ever told me two stories of him being a troublemaker even though he believes he was a really bad one. I have many many stories of making trouble myself and I was a GOOD kid, although i got away with almost all of it. His mother claims he was hanging around with bad kids, his sister says he just wanted to play the normal sports that all kids like to play, but his father wanted him to study. She thinks all men beat their children and there is nothing wrong with it. According to his sister, he got the brunt of the abuse because he wasn't afraid of his father. She said his older brother, who unlike him was a total failure in school, was afraid, so he didn't get beaten. He truly does have a ""fight"" personality with a bit of ""flight"" so I can see that in him. I told his sister about midlife crisis and also the effects of the childhood abuse on him and his current behavior and even though she is uneducated and never went to school herself, she agreed with my interpretation of the situation 100%, which reassured me I was on the right track because she was a firsthand witness to the abuse. I only asked her about his relationship with his father at that time but I really think I need to ask her next time I can take her aside privately about his mother's relationship with him, especially regarding his father's abuse. i feel that might help shed more light on his current behavior.Quote from: 3:45 on August 13, 2017, 10:08:23 AM Im wondering if you and he have to live in his childhood home and with his Mum and sister. Are there no alternatives? Im wondering if he drinks, medicates, or practices a coping technique that leaves him numb (I have no judgement of how others choose to unwind). Could this be addressed if it has become destructive?Fortunately there is absolutely no substance abuse beyond an addiction to chewing tobacco (he started smoking at 16 and quit cigarettes for a while when he had a cancer scare but then someone gave him chewing tobacco and he got addicted again). He saw what happened to his father with his opium addiction and as a consequence he won't even prescribe any sort of addictive drugs to his patients whatsoever even if they really badly needed them because he doesn't want the responsibility of making anyone addicted like his father. So in that sense he does understand his father's legacy and does not want to perpetuate it in himself or anyone else.There is something else he is doing though that I think could to some extent account for the numbness as I think if he felt anything, the guilt he would feel toward me would be too much so he has had to turn off his feelings. But he readily admits to having no feelings. At one point I told him he is like a robot: I push a button, and he does what I ask of him in terms of practical matters, but he feels nothing. He totally agreed with this assessment.I was keeping this journal last summer when he really started creating problems for me and he found it recently and wanted to read some of it with me. I didn't want to but he would not give up or let me pry it out of his hands. One of the things I talked about in it was how I felt I was in a small boat in a hurricane. He said I was a very good writer and he agreed that he was like a hurricane actually. To demonstrate it, he told me how the previous day he had fired a nurse, docked another's pay for 3 months, and hired another to work for free for 3 months because she wasn't well trained enough. Before that I hadn't realize what a terror he was being at work (he's a director of a newly opened hospital) So he does indeed have some self-awareness of what he is doing and how it affects others. What seems to be lacking mostly is the cause and effect part of it. I'm hesitant to say to him, ""You aren't your father"" or ""Your father isn't around"" because he might just be driven more into denial.Living with MIL isn't really something we can avoid. But she is a huge problem not just for the PTSD but also for other issues related to his midlife crisis. Her health is bad and he believes he will wind up like her. She is diabetic and is really bad about taking proper care of herself or even taking the right insulin doses. Even though she is living with her son a doctor who constantly reminds her what she should be doing. She's also started to show signs of dementia since late last year. He is in denial mostly about that too.Quote from: 3:45 on August 13, 2017, 10:08:23 AMWell done for drawing boundaries - maintain them. In the past I have accused my husband of playing the role of a victim... I hate admitting that those were my exact words. I have a better understanding of it all right now and can see I have played a role too. I'm going to work on that. All the best to you and your husband.It's interesting you talk about your husband playing the role of the victim. Correct me if I am wrong, but it sounds like you wanted him to be stronger and NOT roll over and taken it when you abused him. I've gotten the same advice about midlife crisis, that they actually are crying out for someone to set boundaries on them. And sometimes I have responded to his behavior in a way that left me thinking ""Oh *, now he is going to be really pissed at me"" but then he came back in a better state afterward. My husband desperately wants me to be happy right now and gets angry if I seem depressed, even though he knows he is making my life *. But he doesn't want to take the actions necessary to ameliorate the situation. And I am the only one who is willing to set the boundaries on him. It's a cultural thing I think. People here are too deferential to a male and a doctor to stand up to him if he acts abusive. I'm from a different culture and I have a PhD so I am not going to kowtow to him and allow myself to be controlled in a bad way and he knows it. Yet, in spite of all his bad behavior, I do feel he has more respect for me than he does for others. But that he can't control me with abuse also drives him mad."
460,What you describe sounds awful.  There are many different ways of being in denial about abuse and its effects.  Do you ever feel angry about being treated abusively or do you always seek to find reasons to explain it?
461,"I'm more upset about the things he is NOT doing than the things he is doing, to be honest. He's really lost so much of himself in the past year and a half. He has become very narrow minded, not in the sense the doesn't have an open mind, but he has become obsessed with food and talking about food and controlling food and cooking and shopping and going on long harangues about food and critiquing what is cooked. His mother telling me his father was abusive toward her at meal times explains some of it, but it really goes beyond that. He has become obsessed with eating the food of his childhood too and one day he actually stuck out his tongue when I said I was making something that he always used to like to eat. I can't really explain why he has latched on to food. It's a mystery except maybe it is just low hanging fruit (so to speak) for someone who really wants to control his life.I would challenge him when he got grouchy at meals and several times he refused to eat with his mother and myself for extended periods of time. It was all about control. Frankly, I was relieved to not eat with him, but then his mother would start getting grouchy. She would complain about the food I made or look really morose and even one day she snarled at me that the food tasted better when there were others at the table, as if I was to blame for him leaving us. I was in a catch-22. I couldn't eat with her (and him) and I couldn't eat with just her, one or the other would behave badly, OR BOTH. Because she started modeling his behavior at some point. But it's not like I could say ""Your mother should eat by herself."" Because when she wasn't here to eat with us he was fine.I finally turned the tables on him one day when I saw the opportunity and it was ME who refused to eat with them. I kept this up for an entire month. At first he was curious about it, tried to get me to come back, but I refused to budge. He respected my choice (I actually had made a video of him with my phone 3 months before when he was haranguing us that mealtimes were about ""freedom"" and we didn't have to eat together if we didn't want to do so and if he had challenged me about it I would have been able to show him his own words) but I was polite and I ate by myself. Our relationship improved. I came back to eat with them after a month and he let out all this anger at me  about the previous month during that meal and so I went back the next day to not eating with them. Eventually one day he came to me and said, ""You are eating with us today and don't argue."" So I went and he behaved himself. Since then he has had more self-control but he knows now I have boundaries. Some days he just sits silently at the meals and says nothing.As awful as this all sounds, I have managed to get it under control but it took me setting a boundary that I could control and he couldn't. And really when we are alone together, he is not engaging in this kind of behavior. Yes, we do fight sometimes but I would call it a heated argument, not abuse. But there is so much else about him that I miss. He is physically, emotionally and mentally distant. I wouldn't say I am angry about this, but it's really a lot easier to stop someone from doing something than to force them to do something. You can't make someone be closer to you if they don't want to (or can't be). "
462,"Hi Anchor,I hope you don't find this upsetting, please hear me out. There are many, many, many red flags of DID, dissociative identity disorder, previously referred to as multiple personality disorder, in your testimony. I see more very clear indicators of DID than I do CPTSD. DID is a survival mechanism the psyches of highly intelligent children employ, when the abuse is so severe that the mind splits. One compartment of the mind holds the abuse and the memory, allowing the other part of the mind to be shielded, forget, and go to school. It often begins in infancy. His behavior is not actually reflective of what I understand CPTSD to present as. Trauma is the fundamental cause of DID - people with DID do have PTSD or CPTSD, but their abuse was up a few notches and caused this amazing survival function available to humans to enable cognitive survival. I have a lot of personal experience with this, which is why I feel confident about what I am seeing in your posts. I do not have DID myself, but still consider myself a lived-experience expert  The nature of DID is to be covert. Many people don't realize they themselves have it or that their husband or wife have it, until mid-life, if ever. Many people with DID cannot function at all and many are very highly successful - they actually create personalities whose role it is to achieve. DID is designed to hide and protect the person. It happens when abuse is so horrific that the mind cannot stand it. More severe abuse causes it than the majority of people occupying this board endured (not to minimise, just explaining) DID often goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. There are often apparently normal parts who act as the Host. The Host's job is to go to work, be a husband, and live a normal life. The Host is in complete denial, has to be in order to do its job to protect the system.  It is possible that the personality acting as The Host changed when you arrived at your MIL's house. That may explain the drastic changes in behavior. I'll go through and find the strong signs of DID I see:*Actually what he described in some cases was more like torture. As noted above, torture creates DID in highly intelligent, resillient children. Others go insane or die. *He told me he was a troublemaker child and that is why his father beat him. Child alters often take this identity, as a bad trouble maker*He said he was never ever happy during his childhood. Indicates severe abuse or amnesia*He told me at the age of 16 he stood up to his father and told him if he didn't stop beating his mother, he would kill him with his own hands, and his father stopped. Emergence of powerful protective alter, possibly capable of murder under specific circumstances?*He almost seemed like he had a mild case of manic depression the first 5 years of our marriage and then things got better and better until he seemed pretty normal. Do you say manic depression because of sudden, extreme mood swings? Suddenly very 'up' then down? In context, that could suggest DID*Then about a year and a half ago everything started to change. The glue holding the system you were familiar with, began to come unstuck?*His mother has also confirmed that much of his behavior right now is just like his father (he even sometimes goes into what can be described as trances where he speaks in his father's voice and his native language and cannot understand English). This is not CPTSD. This could very well be an alter personality. It is quite common for people to absorb 'fragments' of their abusers then act the person out. This is very well documented and researched*He also often behaves like he has returned to his childhood and lately has been using a tone of voice that he admitted to me he used when he was 8-9 years old (I noted I had only heard him use it since a month prior and he said I wasn't paying attention because he had been doing it for 3 months!) This is not CPTSD. People with CPTSD do not act out as their inner children or change their voices. This is known as a 'little' alter emerging. A literal child personality. Littles are frequently delightful; many are very scared. Frozen back in time. Calling for his mommy probably connects to a memory that child holds/was created to keep from the rest of the system*However, here's the problem I face. Compared to when we were first married and he clearly could see and admitted the connection between his behavior toward me and his childhood abuse, now at least outwardly he does not admit there to be any connection. Seems quite a dramatic shift of perspective. Could it be that one self of his knows the connection to his father, and another doesn't have access to that information due to amnesiac barriers and lack of co-consciousness?*What I have clearly observed is that his aggressive and controlling behavior is at its worst when his mother is present and the topic of conversation is food or it is meal time. No history of caring about food? A Protector/Controller Alter emerged at the sight of his mother and the return to his hometown? She did say his father was very abusive toward her at the table (not the children) and that he was acting like his father, only his father was worse. Again, could well be an internalised fragment of his father being triggered to come out at the scene of the original creation.  I said, ""Stop worrying about what I eat, where I eat, or who I eat with. Worry about something important, like your exams."" What struck me was as soon as I said that, he shot up from sitting like a rocket, said, ""You are right"" and left the room. I realized I had touched upon something, namely that telling him he needed to study resulted in an overly compliant response. Sounds exactly like a switch. Another personality emerged in that moment, probably the one whose job it is to obey the father and study. However, unlike when we were first married, there is no acknowledgement from him about this Different host personality at the helm, than the one you married?many times he just sits silently at meals. Quite extremes of behavior - abusive and controlling or silent. Different parts of him active? He is suffering from complete emotional numbing. Very common with DID. Tells me he loves no one and that if he could feel he would wish he was dead. Common DIDWhen I say nice things to him like how much I love him and care about him, he gets a very pained look on his face, like he has constipation and someone stuffed a bitter lemon in his mouth. Common DIDHe is convinced his behavior is the real him and that he wasn't himself before. Indicates different selves, different personalities. If it is DID, this current self truly wasn't the same person who was in charge of the body before. He's telling you the truth. *He's obsessed with wanting to feel in control, before he was happy to share decision making with me. CPTSD usually doesn't produce such radical personality or relational changes. I haven't encountered that as a symptom in any of my research. I've researched a lot *He is engaging in a lot of destructive behaviors that could have lifelong consequences for multiple people if not nipped in the bud sooner rather than later Might be alters engaging in that behavior*From what I have learned about midlife crisis, the different voices are him returning to earlier stages of his life when he had issues and/or acting out the abuser role (i.e. his father). Is there evidence that this happens during a midlife crisis? I've never heard of that as a midlife crisis symptom - different voices, reverting to childhood states, embodying an abuser? If that is common in midlife crisis, that is useful learning for me, interesting. *It's interesting that you realize what you are doing, I was really gobsmacked when he said he had been using the 8 year old voice for 3 months. He HADN'T been using it that long, but he obviously was aware that he had started it in the near past when I told him he never used it before. He told me he used to say ""Mommy mommy"" in that voice (he uses it to call me as well) and I asked him if he used it when he needed something from her. He went silent at that point. Loss of time/inability to track time, classic dissociative symptom. I think I saw you mention somewhere else that he loses time? If so, that will be when different parts of him are active*No it's clear he hasn't. He may literally not remember. Different parts may remember different things, but not one cohesive story*97% of his stories from his childhood involve animals, not people, and he is an endless source of animal stories-wild, stray, pets, farm animals-you name it, his mind is a virtual zoo. I even asked him a few months ago if he spent all his time with animals as a child and he said yes! Unrealistic account of his childhood. Inner world stuff? Happens a lot. *He has only ever told me two stories of him being a troublemaker even though he believes he was a really bad one. *There is something else he is doing though that I think could to some extent account for the numbness as I think if he felt anything, the guilt he would feel toward me would be too much so he has had to turn off his feelings. *At one point I told him he is like a robot: I push a button, and he does what I ask of him in terms of practical matters, but he feels nothing.

Because when she wasn't here to eat with us he was fine. She may trigger a particular protective personality to emerge to protect the littles and other personalities who don't feel capable of sitting in her presence, considering she was complicit in their abuse and would be a heavy, heavy, dangerous trigger for him* (I actually had made a video of him with my phone 3 months before when he was haranguing us that mealtimes were about ""freedom"" and we didn't have to eat together if we didn't want to do so and if he had challenged me about it I would have been able to show him his own words) but I was polite and I ate by myself. So.... do you feel like you have to record him, to show him versions of his own opinions, because later on, he will forget what he said or have a totally different stance? That's not CPTSD. *But there is so much else about him that I miss. He is physically, emotionally and mentally distant. I wouldn't say I am angry about this, but it's really a lot easier to stop someone from doing something than to force them to do something. You can't make someone be closer to you if they don't want to (or can't be). The person you are interacting with may not be in love with you, may have been 'asleep' when the body married you, may not consider you his/her wife, may have just met you. Please research DID thoroughly, and research CPTSD thoroughly. I can recommend this book for a thorough and in depth, complete understanding of CPTSD. https://www.amazon.com/Complex-PTSD-Surviving-RECOVERING-CHILDHOOD/dp/1492871842 There are plenty of excellent books on DID too. It's always better to know the truth either way. The three C's: you didn't cause it, you can't cure it, you can't control it. No matter what it is he has, please look after yourself and stay focused on you and your needs. If it is CPTSD, it really should respond to clear communication. He may be the fight/narcissist type as described in the book linked above. Denial is powerful in CPTSD but your husband's denial sounds quite extreme. Many people with CPTSD are people pleasers who need harmony in relationships, are badly frightened by arguments, are perfectionists and readily take on criticism from others and work hard to change - though I may be speaking from a 'fawn' point of view. Wishing you all the very best. Read some good books and you'll be well armed with the right info   "
463,"I confess, although I don't have first hand experience with DID, it leapt out at me, too. Lots of us here, myself included, recognize different personalities within us. My therapist says, ""Everyone is a bus load of people."" There are some forum members here who are diagnosed with DID, I hope some of them will weigh in on this thread. In any case, please feel free to stay here and ask questions and reach out for support.  "
464,"Hi AnchorintheStorm,I believe abuse is very harmful to our health.  I can't know, but I suspect what you are experiencing is serious abuse.  It worries me that you have adapted to this situation and are actively making excuses for it.  I suspect that it won't be until you are free from abuse that you will realise the harm it caused you, and the severity of it.  I realise that I'm basing this on my own experience, and that one of the things that concerns me most is your response to it.I spent far too much of my life being adapted to being abused, making excuses for abuse, and  being unable to recognise how harmful it was.  So much of what you write, in particular; feeling compassionate rather than indignant,  feeling grateful, almost to the point of awarding brownie points, when he is not abusive  (see intermittent reinforcement), looking a long way back to a time when there was no abuse, and imagining that there is a way back, seeing this as a therapeutic problem, when your husband is not in therapy and has no desire to work on his problems,.... - your entire focus is on helping your husband it rings alarm bells for me, because it is all at your own expense.  I feel it may be that you may have developed symptoms of CPTSD as a result of interpersonal abuse.I want you to see yourself as being important and valuable, as worthy of dignity and respect.  From what you have written, I feel you have been in a 'frog-boiling' situation for longer than you realise.  I really hope you will seek therapy for yourself so you can talk openly about your experiences and how you have been, and continue to be affected. Every person who was abusive to me had issues and problems at the root of their abusive behaviour.  I felt compassion for the abusive person but not for myself.  I became more and more adapted to abuse and this was very much at the expense of my own health and well-being.   I really hope you seek help and support for yourself, because you matter."

I am certain of that. I know that people in certain cultures have a lot of faith in therapy. I will just tell you this. There's no such thing as therapy in the culture we live in. No I'm not in denial about anything, but to criticize my husband for not being in therapy is simply unfair to him and insulting.  Yes, I do defend him because while I have pointed out the symptoms he is suffering from as that is what this forum is about, I am not giving you a complete picture of him and the good and normal side that I see too. And really I find it offensive that you jump to the conclusion that I think I don't deserve dignity and respect. My H knows that I believe that I do and I expect it and that I am not shy about demanding it. I don't always get it, but he is acutely aware that he should be giving it to me and he wants to do that. I really see he is doing his best that he can right now and trying even though he isn't perfect. "
466,"Hi All - I just wanted to pop in here and encourage posters to take one step back from diagnosing others and/or giving advice.  Certainly suggesting areas a member may want to consider looking into is fine, we all can use some feedback and input as that's a main reason we are here. Anything beyond that, however, can seep over the line into pressuring others to see something the way we do, or perhaps telling them what they should/should not do.  This doesn't give the member space/time to figure things out for themselves, and can result in the receiver feeling defensive.This is why our guidelines encourage members to share what has worked for them, perhaps pointing out something they have picked up in a member's posts, but not pushing their own perspective.  I know we all want to help our fellow members  , but please do so in the form of suggestions, examples of what you have been through that seem similar, what has worked/not worked for you, etc. Similarly, we are not here to diagnose anyone so any suggestions about what areas to look into regarding someone's behaviour should be taken as just that, suggestions. And if you are asking for some feedback about someone's behaviour please remember that we are not trained to diagnose anyone, we can only share what we have encountered ourselves or offer a suggestion.  So, please let's take a step back from giving advice/diagnosing and instead offer and receive suggestions in a respectful and considerate manner. Thanks everyone!  "

468,"I'm the spouse of someone with CPTSD and his memory issues are one of the biggest problems. I wonder how much other sufferers can say about their memory loss because if you can't remember something, you may not even realize you have forgotten. Here's some of the issues my husband has to show you the breadth of the memory issues he is having. It's not like people who forget their keys or somesuch at all.I feel as if the memory of the past 23 years of his life is very foggy and that he is living more in his childhood. This is clearly manifested to me in the things he does NOT say anymore. He had certain phrases and lines he used to use with me ALL the time. Many of these he simply has not uttered since he has fallen into this state a year and a half ago. Even negative statements he used to make, he simply does not say them anymore.Sometimes his memory winds up reversing things or is projection. For example, he saw something that needed fixing and asked me if HE should fix it (I don't know how to do it myself and he knows that). I told him he should go ahead and fix it. A few weeks later, he said to me, ""I told you to fix xyz, why haven't you done it?"" Perhaps he felt bad about not having done it but he projected it on me?There is a very sensitive matter between us, something he has not been doing lately and he knows it upsets me more than anything. He actually sat here and told me, ""I did xyz MANY times."" He actually did it only 3 times in the last 9 months and this is a factual matter, not one of opinion. I think he actually really believed what he was saying because to believe otherwise would mean he was being really neglectful toward me and he can't face himself.He can get in a very agitated state and not remember it AT ALL. One Friday he tried to create trouble between me and his mother. It wasn't working and actually what he was trying to do was so ironic that I laughed at him. He was acting like a big drama queen and got very annoyed. A week later something came up that reminded me of what had happened and I mentioned it to him. He had NO MEMORY of the whole incident. NONE. I recounted what happened and he laughed as if I was telling him a story about someone other than himself.The very same evening I told him what he had done the previous week, he got very upset and swore he was not going to eat some fish I had in the freezer. That if I tried to serve it to him, he would feed it to the dog. I figured he would not remember this incident either. So two days later I told him if he brought some lemons and parsley, I would cook the fish. He said he would, but it took a few days for him to bring the stuff. But clearly he had forgotten he swore he would not eat it. Then after he did, he asked me one night whether I planned to cook the fish the next day because he wanted to confirm for sure. I said I would. Still not remembering what he swore. The next morning I got up, cleaned the fish, put it in the marinade, and then when I mentioned the fish to him, suddenly he said he remembered he swore he would not eat the fish and he refused to eat it. There was still half in the freezer after that and he vacillated about what to do with it for months and was very agitated by the whole thought of it, even though it was his favorite type of fish. The remainder eventually did go to the dog because it was too old anymore.  I asked him to buy me something. There are two kinds of this thing, expensive and flimsy and cheap and sturdy. I told him to bring the latter, and explained to him why even. He came home with the former. He was so upset when I told him I had told him to bring the opposite, he swore I had not told him such a thing and we were shouting at eachother about it.His mother had an old stove that we converted to a bbq by stripping out all its parts. He did it together with me. A few months later, he offered to his mother to bring back the stove for her to use, not realizing that it wasn't just sitting outside unused, it was stripped to the point of being unusable as a stove anymore. I didn't correct him on this one.He is studying for his masters exams now. He told me he is having memory problems. He said when he finishes studying one subject and switches to another he forgets what he studied previously. He rattled off a list of the subjects he is studying, one of them was ""psychology"". He's not studying ""psychology,"" not even ""psychiatry"". I pointed this out to him. He claims he had this memory problem when he was studying before, but he NEVER complained about it before to me so I have my doubts."
469,"Anchorinthestorm, in my experience memory issues that correspond with CPTSD are not as severe and perplexing as what you've described.  I may be wrong and others can set me straight.  My memory issues are similar to what Deb described where I realize that I am possibly forgetting something.  I'll ""forget"" whether I've done some task or not.  Or, it could be that I'm aware that I can't recall what happened the night before.  It's a blank.  But, with some reminders it usually comes back to me and I can recall most of what went on.  "
470,"Anchorinthestorm, the memory issues you've described aren't what I'm having. I agree with Kat that they seem more severe than 'just CPTSD'.  "
471,"Deb, what you've posted at the top of the thread, that's the type of thing I have trouble with too. It seems common to CPTSD, even if not every one is posting that it is. Anchor, I agree with Deb and Kat that what your are experiencing with your husband is not typical CPTSD. "
472,"Hey everyone,I'm not sure if im posting in the right place or even doing this right, but i have been dating a woman who has CPTSD, i would humbly  ask anyone that has any info or advice on how i can be a better boyfriend to her, i've done a little research as far as causes and what not. but i'm really looking for advice on what i can do to help her not so much to make it easier on me at ALL but to be there for her and help her through her triggered events she suffers from and what i can or cant do to help our relationship any help would be greatly appreciated and thank you allAny personal replies can be emailed to me steve.kalohelani@gmail"
473,"It's so great you're interested in learning how to help your girlfriend.  Reading Pete Walker's book Surviving to Thriving would be a good way to learn about CPTSD.  I haven't been on this forum for too very long, but I know there are a lot of symptoms people share in common and can relate too, but there are also others that are unique to the individual.  Does that make sense?  My husband isn't very supportive.  He's scared off by a lot of what I go through and doesn't want to hear about it.  Or, he minimizes what I say.  If he were to ask me what I need, I think I'd tell him I'd like him just to listen and try to understand what I go through.  I oftentimes feel really guilty about not having the energy to do things.  I frequently feel exhausted.  I'd like reassurance that he knows I'm not lazy or playing games or looking for sympathy.  I'd like him to be patient with me.  I guess, what I'd want is what most people want--someone to listen and be empathetic, someone to be supportive, someone to gentle and patient, someone to show grace.Hope this helps.  Maybe keep reading through different threads would help as well."
474,"The most helpful thing my husband does for me is just listening, without trying to help me. So often we just want to be heard, but a lot of what we have to say is uncomfortable for others to hear. Listening, a gentle touch, a soft ""I love you"" when he knows I'm struggling. "
475,"Have you asked her what you can do for her?  I know when I have a moment in therapy my therapist asks me what she can do to help.  It took time but now I know how to answer.  At first I didn't know what she could do.  Now I say things like ""help me ground.""  I keep things in her office such as essential oils that are available when I am there.  I have even said ""let's talk about the trip I am planning.""  Maybe even creating a list of ways to help her in advance might help.  If one thing doesn't work go to the next."
476,"I agree with both of what they said. Sit down a maybe create a list of things that can help her calm down. For me I have a hard time staying calm, if she does it can be useful to know ahead of time what helps her. I find that in those moments, I don't know how to answer, or how to tell someone what will help. I made a short list of things for her that help me ground, and help me cope that she could easily help me with. It has truly shown to help, because she can look at it or remember small things and give me those reminders. Educating yourself on symptoms helps too. I suggest reading stuff here. Everyone is really kind and for someone that wants to help their significant other I can imagine we are open to helping best we can. I know I am willing if you are ever on one of my threads"
477,"For the last couple of weeks I've been living with a family that took me in so that I didn't have to live with my abusive father anymore.  And the 17 year old daughter in the household has starting telling me that I'm too polite and so it makes her feel like she has to be really polite.  She told me I'm allowed to be grumpy.  And basically I don't know what to do.  I'm figuring out that I'm a big fawn-type (Pete Walker's 4 F-types - fight, flight, freeze, fawn), and I'm trying really hard to be patient and nice In order to not make people angry.  But if being nice frustrates her then, what the flip am I supposed to do not to irritate people?  On top of it, sometimes I'll do something and she'll tell me, ""See that's what I mean.  You're being too polite,"" so I worry about hearing that.  I think part of what she's saying is she doesn't understand why I don't set more boundaries.  But sheesh...I'm half tempted to set a boundary and tell her to stop because she doesn't understand what I'm experiencing.  She doesn't understand that I'm just learning to feel and act like a person separate from the world around me.  I'm just learning to believe that I have needs and wants that are legitimate.  "
478,"Quote I have needs and wants that are legitimate.    you do. I'm sorry my mind is fuzzy and I can't think of the right response, but I wanted to let you know you were heard."
479,"First, she is so very young and probably can't get what you are going through.  Still, my guess is unknowingly she is talking about boundaries.  Setting a boundary with her to stop saying that is a big step.  "
480,"I understand what you're saying, writetolife, because I'm also a fawn type with a big dose of freeze in there too. For most of my adult life people have told me things such as ""you always seem to be apologising for yourself"" and ""you don't seem to like yourself"". I hate this image of myself as a creepy crawling Uriah Heep, especially when I see it parodied in movie and TV comedies. That means I understand how annoying it is for other people. I also have a flipside: although I'm known as 'quiet' and do my utmost not to give offence, occasionally the brakes fail and I know I come across as passive-aggressive at those times. I've lost friends with that.I believe the answer lies in self-compassion -- knowing we're not really this way, it's the CPTSD acting out -- and acts of assertiveness when we can manage them. Obviously the answer is not to apologise to the daughter of the house. Classical assertiveness includes how you feel about the situation, a description of the other person's triggering behaviour, and perhaps in your case a description of what behaviour you would prefer. Eg. ""When you say I'm too polite, I feel scared. I've moved in with your family because my father was abusing me, and it'll take me a while to feel relaxed here.  You can help me with that.""I really do sympathise. I'm living with my mother-in-law and have been tiptoeing around her for nearly a year..."
481,"i really like candid's suggestion about being assertive.  sounds very good.  maybe it'll work for you, if you feel up to giving it a shot.  i've done something similar, walking on tiptoes, apologizing a lot, especially when in a new place.  it's like i didn't know the 'rules' yet, so i didn't really know which way to go, how much i could assert myself, what was expected of me, etc.  speaking up and letting someone know, tho, sounds really good to me.  i wish i would've thought of that before.  it would've saved me a lot of angst.  best to you with this.  big hug."
482,"In my twenties I shared a couple of digs with other people and was so polite I ended up retreating into my room and becoming virtually invisible. (Repeating birth pattern as was left in the garage as baby..)  Politeness is a spectrum I guess, and the further we go along it the more we apologise for our existence. ( like Pete Walker apologising for bumping into a chair!)  We are trained into existing too far along the politeness spectrum..as it suits the narcs. I relish now being able to set boundaries and still be free to be my loving self within those boundaries...I say no and 'disagree' quite a lot! Kindly....we can be assertive and kind...its a magical combination that one.  Also noticed recently holding back from saying sorry and choosing not to, and realising thats ok over trivial things...the world didnt grind to a juddering halt... Great idea to just say how its making you feel! You are allowed to be you, unique and full of your own needs and opinions..... there is plenty of room for you in this universe!!  "

484,"I literally signed up just for this. I can tell you what's going on because I'm older and have dealt with people complaining more when I was in my teens than ever. Not sure why it happens between K-12 more often than any other stage, but it does.First, as a (grim) note: be careful what you tell her, she may not empathize. She could also be a little wacko herself. I'm coming to understand that what makes us constant targets is being honest about our experiences. Somehow it's some weird form of advertisement for those who are crazy to apply their crazy onto us and color our vision as to how the world works.The crux of all of this is that this person is actually expecting you to manage her emotions. Are you this person? You're not... So, how can you cause her discomfort if you're not harming her or anybody or anything else in any way? You're not placed there to make anyone feel any way about themselves. You're there to get through your day/life. It's up to her on how to take the presence of another individual. If anything, she needs to know that you are not her anytime she comes up complaining. I agree that you need to be upfront and draw a line for this reason, and if she continues, keep drawing that line and give her consequences if she fails to understand that what she is doing is not right by your terms, and adhere to the consequence(s) if the time comes to do so (which I know can feel like it's hard when it's not even your place)."

No big deal on the boundaries part. Nobody actually talks about boundaries in a way that makes sense and is clear. At best, people make it sound like you just say 'no' and it goes away, or you keep saying 'no' and it goes away. I'm still learning what it means and it seems like that's not how it works. You have to be relentless and kinda ruthless about the consequences. For instance, say you're friends with someone you think is super great and they keep doing things to hurt you, but you like them so much. You gotta tell them to stop or else you'll no longer talk to them. As much as it hurts for you to lay that down on them, you gotta follow through with no longer talking to them if they continue, and even if years later they pop up and don't seem to have gotten the memo and understood the repercussions form the past, still gotta enforce that consequence, no matter how much you like them.I've also read that enforcing boundaries for people like us is more for practice for ourselves than it is for our FOO or primary abuser(s) to adhere to. From the information I've gathered, it seems like the only real option is to walk away in some form.I read this article a few months back on boundaries. No idea where it was from as I had my browser on incognito when doing it. It said you know when someone does not respect your boundaries when they get irrationally mad. It explained it better than I just did, but it pretty much said that when someone takes it as your no and explode it into a personal offense, that's actually them not happy about a boundary and wanting to cross it. I try to keep it in mind, especially as someone who when asserting themselves is called selfish.I'm not too much older than you, but I sure wish that I knew what I knew earlier because I've been actively working to try and figure it out.Thank you so much for everyone who found value in my post. It's been a while since that's been the case... Facebook makes people very angry and defensive and other awful stuff.ETA: One more thing people fail to explain is forgiveness. I found a podcast on NPR that might be helpful. It's called Forgiveness Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be."
489,"Hi, thanks for joining - here's a good explanation of boundaries and what happens when they're repeatedly violated: http://www.new-synapse.com/aps/wordpress/?p=1911Hope it helps "
490,"Thanks so much 3Roses!       That's a seriously good article (your link) for anyone with serious problems with self-care, like me. "
491,"Wow, that was a sobering read!An extract:The person with disabled boundaries due to trauma history can be:Currently Being Violated. They can be in a relationship that is always violating their boundaries, and they dont know it. Or they do know it but are helpless to leave for a huge number of valid reasons.Free But Vulnerable. They can be out of the relationship, but all their boundaries are still broken. Boundaries do not rebuild themselves. I think it does take a lot of therapy to begin the process of rebuilding the fence, door, etc. In this situation the person is very vulnerable to new boundary violations from others (not just romantic partners but friends and random people).New Relationship, Boundary-Confused. The person can be in a new relationship that isnt necessarily violating any boundaries but they will have boundary confusion  they wont know when their partner is, and when their partner is not, violating a boundary.and this:Some Self-care QuestionsHere are some questions to ponder about self-care.1. Have you ever experienced confusion around what self-care means to you?2. Were you ever in a situation in which, if you stood up for yourself or revealed something about yourself, you would be harmed (physically or verbally/emotionally).3. Have you ever been in a position in which if you tried to take care of your emotional needs it would threaten your physical survival?4. Have you ever been hit by someone who loved you and who you loved? This includes spanking which is a huge boundary invasion.5. Have your boundaries ever been violated to the degree that they were eliminated from existence?6. Has anyone ever treated you like your physical space, personal space, body, somatic knowing, intuitive knowing, emotional space, autonomy, ideas, senses, or opinions were irrelevant? Did having these things out of the picture ever come to feel normal to you?7. Do you remember a moment in which the integrity of your person on all levels was held in the highest respect, and you could feel, physically, in your body, this sense of complete integrity, or did this only happen before your first memories (as a newborn baby) and was lost early in life?8. Has anyone ever been possessive of you? Were you unaware that they were holding onto you as strongly as they were, because it felt normal to take on someone elses needs?9. Does being loved feel like it has something to do with being merged with another, being enmeshed, being entangled, making their needs and wants your own?10. Has anyone ever made their needs become yours without your consent?11. Have you ever been forced to do anything against your will by someone you love?12. Does being loved feel like it has something to do with being controlled, being overpowered, being swept away?13. Did you learn to like being invaded because its familiar and feels like home?I really needed to read this today. Waking up feeling so ill, and immediately getting set for yet another day of self-destruction. The prescribed answer (of course ) is finding the Self with a therapist. Back to that horrendously long waiting list, wondering whether I'll live long enough to see my number come up..."
492,"I'm in my mid-forties and am only now really acknowledging how afraid I am of people.  I can feel these “negative beliefs.” The problem is, I can understand conceptually that they are just beliefs. But emotionally and even physically -- the truth of the world seems to say that I am not one of THEM (people) and that I don’t belong here. I don’t FEEL like life is a good thing.  Its not the thoughts I think but the way things SEEM to be.My progress lies in the fact that part of me is starting to see that these are just beliefs and distortions that come from a lot of pain and not the way things really are. But it feels like it will take so long to actually change the conviction of not belonging here.So today, I decide to commit to patience.  I am engaged as a dad and enjoy being with my family. But I don't have any friends I see on a regular basis. I would like to change this, but I don't want to contrive and sometimes it seems like too much work anyway. I just don't feel like I have anything to say.This is sounding so regressive. You would never know I would write this kind of thing if you worked with me.  But it is the emotional truth that I've only hidden in shame for too long...I am working with a therapist a few times a week now. It just seems like there's too much to address as soon as I would like.Peace all."
493,"That totally resonates. People never would think I have this enormous people fear--I worked with people my whole life, entertained (acting) them for gawd's sake, and on the outside seemed like I had it all put together. Only on the inside...So you're not alone in your frustration, eucocatastrophe21; turning this around won't happen in an instant, and man am I sick of saying that. Besides eliminating those old ingrained beliefs, I'd love to chuck the calendar along with them, as I'm also  tired of hearing me whisper about finding peace someday. Instead I end up with these self-absorbing pep-talks. The beliefs/doubts have a nasty way of creeping back in, along with the rest (fears, anxiety, etc.). It's all part of everyone, though; despite appearances. And we all have the capacity to unlearn and find a new road. Now, though; not someday. And now only happens...now. I know...how silly, eh? Who cares? It helps me gain some perspective; I need it.So while we share the people fears, we also have the capacity to reach beyond. While I don't have specifics to share, I can note the observation that we can find a way. Saying that much, as a possibility, is more than I had for much of life, so I'll take it as a gift and run with it. Out beyond these doubts--we're worthy.  "
494,"QuoteYou would never know I would write this kind of thing if you worked with me.This is me, to a T. I have learned to hide my truest self from everyone, to the point and for so long I'm not sure anymore who I really am. The few times I've revealed any of this to someone in person, the common response (other than minimizing) is ""I never would have guessed""."
495,"woodsgnome...thank you for your beautiful post.  I so see the wisdom what you are saying about now. Some soul searching I'm doing right now is this:I've spent years practicing Buddhist meditation and deeply studying the teachings. I found a deep appreciation that, in many ways, the stories we hold in our minds and bodies are, indeed just stories. That is to say, a past no longer exists except in our body/mind.  At some point, I realized I could have the audacity to feel free and not 'believe' otherwise.  I had some meaningful break-throughs. But even though meditation, yoga, great diet, and an exercise routine helped quell the anxiety, as soon as I strayed from my perfect routine, would feel anxiety get out of control immediately. It started to feel like I was a slave to practice because I HAD to do it. And I was spending more energy than i was getting back just to fend off anxiety.And then, by some grace (and another painful life event) I discovered that I had been utterly ignoring a lot of pain and stored trauma.  Even though I had practiced meditation for years, I didn't see this...I was just trying to manage pain. And so hear I am, now, inviting the story back in. I know it does not define me, but I have to feel it and know why I am in so much pain and have so much anxiety and fear. And looking at the painful story of my life, I do not have to blame anyone, but I can be mad as * and let myself be human and feel anger. So NOW...it turns out, is the time to deeply feel what we feel. I don't have to wait until later for life to start. But I have to be willing to feel the pain of story that won't seem to go away otherwise.I realize that I've strayed for your response. But it has been such a powerful area of learning for me lately.Thank you both for your replies. I have to say, it felt surprisingly reassuring that someone out there is kind and is taking time to share in other people's journey."

I've never been able to talk about stuff before and really be understood. There was always a subtle judgment or just not understanding and offering greeting card advice. Sometimes, when someone offers trite, albeit well-intended advice, part of my gut screams, ""NO, I cannot just look on the bright side! My soul has ached since I can remember and my own parents didn't even care about me. Life has never felt like a safe place for me since I can remember!"" My gut says that, but I say, ""I really appreciate that perspective and see what you're saying.""  But you see, there is hidden judgment in their advice. Because their advice suggests I don't have the right, wholesome intention -- that I'm just being stubborn about not being positive. I've struggled my whole life just to be normal and look on the bright side. And I hated myself for not being able to do it (""WHAT is WRONG with ME??!!!"")I thought this forum would be good for information. And I thought it would be like Facebook where everyone is sarcastic and all knowing. But now I am finding some surprising healing in finding someone who deeply speaks this language and has something beautiful and true and helpful to say about it. So deep bow to you. So much gratitude."
499,"And another bow back to eu!- this could go on for a while!  It always strikes me how warped it is that it is the truth tellers of this world who are branded as the traitors... ''how dare you disturb our lovely safe (fake) and pleasant ( numb ) and socially acceptable ( bland and soul less) world ''.  What they really mean but cannot admit to themselves of course is 'aaagh!  how dare you expose my cowardice and my refusal to tell my own truths!'  Poor buggers.  But yes, in those awful moments of interaction we are so torn, so challenged and so stressed.  Those moments are what I avoid by self isolating.  The bliss of peace and no fakery to me is worth the loneliness that is a price to pay.  But at least I now know that the loneliness does NOT mean I am a ''loser'' ...... it is simply a side effect of my choosing to treat myself to space, privacy and the indulgence of doing things my own sweet way.  ' You are so selfish'!! I hear the old echoes somewhere within, and I give them the bird, and feel a surge of victory.  As the old song says ... ''You gotta fight, for the right, to par-r-rty!''Perfectly put .... lets rock!   "
500,"I think I'm resigning myself to a lonely existence. My FOO is a mess, and I know now that the further I can get from all of them, the better. Most of my friends are terrible for my mental health, and I'm severely socially phobic, so making new ones and keeping them is a chore. And as for relationships... The only proper boyfriend I've ever had was an abusive, suspected NPD ogre who I only dated because I was scared of staying by myself. That ended over four years ago and the only interest I've seen since then was one guy who just wanted to use me to blow off steam and then ran off. No one wants to be around me. Very few people even make the effort to see me. I guess I'd better get used to being alone."
501,"I hope you manage not to feel alone on here. I know, I know, it's not the same as IRL, but it is something. "
502,"You and I are not so different.  I don't feel alone here, I have friends here.  Also, I am going to chose to have a healthier life.  It may meaning getting out and meeting people, I am going to do it.  I am going to do it a little at a time.  I might actually have to join a club, a book club sounds like a good start.  It is time - I decide.  I am going to decide my friends and my family.  I am going to decide to move forward and do what is best for me."
503,"#songbirdrosa:  It seems like you don't  value yourself much or maybe  you don't like yourself ?  IDK, I am not you but I can hear how you talk so poorly of yourself and I don't think it's positive.  This is how I feel. Are you in therapy?  Because it would help to have someone who thinks at least neutrally of you in light of the fact, as you stated,  there are many negative people in your life. good luck."
504,"Hi Songbirdrosa  I think we pull away into ourselves and into alone for a specific reason... for space to heal.  When we judge that alone space as a negative thing (  this is just stupid ignorance from the brainwashed world that we have adopted as our viewpoint) we delay the healing... Nature is in us, the instinct to retreat to lick our wounds. Primal wisdom... if you have not read the book  'Women Who Run With The Wolves' ... please do.. it explains so much of this.  When I started to understand my alone state as essential, it changed my life...yours can too. "
505,"Recently a bunch of things happened, some good some bad. It didn't trigger me (I think  ), I'm feeling stronger though.A friend ressurfaced, sent me a bunch of antipsychiatry videos and I stood my ground and told him that if it wasn't for pills I would be talking to myself on the street or ending up on a grave more likely. I stopped answering his emails and will vanish from his life  Another friend needs my help to deal with her boyfriend, she also suffered from some neglecting as a child, but no major abuse besides that I think, which left her some trauma as well, although I don't think it constitutes CPTSD, as it as not as strong and only shows in her relationships with others. Her boyfriend has bipolar as well and she asks for my help, I don't mind, I'm available to her.An ex ressurfaced and wants to be friends again, I don't know what to make of that, I will meet him to see what he trully wants out of this, and see where I go from there. If I have the time, with work and my own interests I hardly ever get the time to go way one hour and half across town to be one hour with them and then come back. I need to take a whole afternoon out of my schedule and I'm not sure I'm up for it. Funny enough, in the past this particular ex ressurfacing would bring back all sorts of emotions and I would be swooning over him all over again, this time that didn't happen. I've been daydreaming about meeting someone who is worth it and treats me right, not because I feel lonely but because I deserve love.All of this, and more that I will keep out of here, happened in the last week and I suppose I could've crumbled, remembered the loneliness I feel and how hard this whole ordeal has been so far, but I didn't. I'm calm and centered and being able to juggle between all of these events and triggering emotions without spiraling. I think this is good news. I'm available for  my friends that in fact need me, want to hang out with me or just talk a bit about the latest whoever album, that's all fine. But I'm not available to being manipulated, that ship has sailed. After so many years of being a puppet for others, I think I've grown!!  "
506,   
507,"Thanks Three Roses, baby steps!   "
508,This is great!  This is exactly what I am trying to accomplish.  I'm not quite sure how to go about it but you give me hope.  I'm very happy for you and I hope to learn from your example 
509,"Hi all,This is a spinoff thread to the one called ""surviving character assassination"". Things have gotten better, but there is still some awkwardness. I have spent months ""doing nothing"", and now I just want to address things and get them out of the way.So given that people like to get in on other people's business, I've decided to write a letter for everyone involved to read. I plan to put this on Facebook first thing Monday morning, but i'd like to share it with you first.The letter here is long, sorry. And when I share it on my wall I'll delete it here. Time to take control of this mess.------------------------------*Apologies. Have decided not to wait, and have deleted the letter. Will let you know if anything happens."
510,"Hope there's no bad fallout. If there is, stay strong and come and post on here. We're here for you. "
511,"None so far Blueberry.Lots of support currently.I've not mentioned names, only my experience, and things I've noticed.People can make up their own minds and I'm more than happy for people to leave my life."
512,"So sorry I deleted my message here. But I have gathered a lot of support from it, and private messages from people who have gone/are going through similar.A couple of people who are at my workplace have acknowledged the post on there, but all who I know were involved have not. The crux is, I asked them to question what they have heard now if they didn't before. If they have been lead to believe I have done something to them, then please talk to me and we can resolve it.I did state that for anybody who at this point still blindly accepts the rumours and gossip as fact, then they are no my friend so please leave my life immediately. So far only one person has, but I can't even figure out who that person is.A mountain of support from far and wide, from people who know me better. We'll see what comes of those involved, there are already more than enough responses for them to mull over and gossip about."
513,"I've been waiting for a fall out, but none yet.Responses have been profound, and in many different ways. People I haven't heard from in years all lending support. Childood friends.People from work are also responding in their unique ways. People i'm not even friends with.Students... A big grown man has cried.Friends are calling friends.A lot of people are acknowledging this, and are being very sensitive to it.That's all for today.I'm ready to move on."
514,"Wow, Contessa, that's so great!"
515,Yeah.
516,"Still no fallout.A lot of people in general conversation have slipped in an 'are you okay?' and I can confidently reply 'yes thank you' before steering to conversation to better topics.Other friends tell me that they read the post, and we discuss some things in it.I think one or two are avoiding me, but do I care? Not in the slightest.I think by calling it what it was, it destroyed the uncertaintly in others. Many are starting the conversations with me now, not the other way around. It feels easier to walk in a room.I can do what I need to and not worry about what people are thinking.It feel good to finally be back at ""meh..."" and concentrate completely on work."
517,"good for you. great stuff.I never had to call my darling brother out in public because he was caught between his bad behaviour and the public failure to back up his claims regarding care of my mother. This was then compounded by his online behaviour over the last very political year and suddenly, a lot of people who had certainly doubted my narrative for the last 20 years, suddenly saw what he is capable of. Once that was out in the open and people started talking, people began to contact me and apologise for having been so mislead over the years. Having since spoken to his ex-wife it was clear just how powerful his manipulation of mine and others reputation had been. But that's what they do isn't it? I'm just angry with myself for ever letting any of that stuff under my skin. Wasted years. "
518,"It is such a waste JamesG, you're right. 20 years!! I just don't get it. There are better ways to live.Glad it's finally out. I'm finding for me that I can finally just stop fighting for my life, and now reflect. I really don't have anything left of what I was fighting for I now realise. Such a waste of time when it could have been spent living.Time to start anew."
519,"Quote from: JamesG on May 31, 2017, 07:58:40 AMI'm just angry with myself for ever letting any of that stuff under my skin. Wasted years.This is where I'm at now. But all that effort, all that going back to be abused all over again and worse, shows me as a good and loving person who will almost kill herself to maintain relationships.Good and loving, fine. Maintaining relationships that brutalise my spirit, not fine.I'm so glad both of you have had some validation."
520,"Oh Candid The difference I see is that, although it takes too long... we are learning. And that's something we have over our abusers and blissfully ignorant invalidators.Went out today, finally. It was good, but a little difficult because everything I had missed these last few years just stood out. It got better, but didn't like feeling that way."
521,"I keep thinking of everything I've lost through my mother's cruelty, wondering whether making a written list would feel worse. Had some idea that I would see what might be salvaged. But I suspect... nothing.Thanks for the empathy. Takes no effort to stay the way I am (enraged and miserable) and will take enormous courage at age 61 to dust myself off and start all over again. I know, there's no alternative. Need to marshal my pitiful resources."

Maybe there even is one at The Café, where we can all practise marshalling our own resources and not labelling them pitiful or similar. You have enormous courage! And you've already started dusting yourself off and starting over again.   Lots of good wishes in continuing, and granting yourself breaks when you need them, as you suggested to me in my Journal    I know, I know, it's always easier to see the progress in others and cheer them on than oneself. "
523,"No worries at all Blueberry Candid you're great. I wouldn't call your resources pitiful at all. You're here, and you provide wonderful support to everyone. As Blueberry says, you are already on the way to a new start even if you don't feel it "
524,"A pattern for me: Someone says or does something to me that makes me feel invalidated/disrepsected, and I get triggered by it. I find it difficult to let go of it, and I keep replaying what happened in my mind, sometimes rewriting what happened so I'd express back what I was really feeling, or maybe imagining what I'd say to the person in the future. I don't want to keep thinking about this at all, I want to move on, and it's especially a problem for me at night, because it can cause me to lose a lot of sleep. I'll feel very tired, nod off, but then keep jerking back awake all night, plagued with thoughts about the incident.I wanted to know if anyone had any ideas for how to soften the reaction and let the mind and body let go of these thoughts and imaginary conversations. I want to also mention that I've been to a lot of therapy, including DBT, and have lots of skills for general relaxation and dealing with negative emotion, but it often feels like all the yoga/meditation/CBT/various other skills in the world are not enough to fight against this strong response that takes over my body and mind.All I just want is to be heard and validated by the other person, but in many cases, this is impossible because the other person isn't capable.If anyone is curious, the current situation I'm dealing with happened on Friday (2 days ago). I'm a female engineer, and I have a male coworker who constantly asks if I need help, tries to explain things to me that I already know, and tries to ""correct"" my work before even fully understanding what I did and why. He does not even specialize in my area of engineering, so the knowledge he offers is general and theoretical, and often not applicable to what I'm doing. After he caught my frustration with this once last week, he actually apologized for overstepping, but then on Friday, he was back to offering help when I didn't need help. It makes me feel that my level of knowledge and experience is being totally invalidated. He's not a terrible person and I think I could maybe even talk to him about it, but if I decide to do that, I would want to just worry about it when I do it, not feel like it's constantly in the back of my mind, ruining my weekend and keeping me up at night.I'm interested to hear any thoughts and ideas, thanks in advance."
525,"Quote from: a_bunny on March 05, 2017, 02:15:04 PMI keep replaying what happened in my mind, sometimes rewriting what happened so I'd express back what I was really feeling, or maybe imagining what I'd say to the person in the future.I do this, too, but I hone it to a riposte I'm happy with and let it go. The work situation you describe is a tough one. I've been in that position as well, where someone assumes an air of superiority and everything they say and do reflects how much better they are than you.My only suggestion is that you try a broken-record response with him. ""Thank you, Fred, I can't imagine why I didn't think of that"", saying the same words the same way every time, then going about your business. It sounds as though he's deliberately putting you down (maybe he feels threatened?) so he's unlikely to miss the sarcasm."
526,"Hi and welcome a_Bunny.As far as the situation with your co-worker  is concerned, this is something you need to  find some kind of a solution to, imo.  It's is not okay for other people to make themselves feel smart, superior, powerful, useful, important etc. by making us feel stupid, inferior, powerless, useless and unimportant.  No wonder your well-being and sleep are suffering, if you are having to regularly contend with this behviour in a situation you can't escape.There are two websites I know of that provide brilliant scripts and information for dealing with difficult situations like this: 'Captain Awkward' and 'Ask a Manager'.  If you go through the topics, I think you will find some expert advice in response to questions about problems very similar to your's.  If you find something very similar in CA, aslo read the discussion, because there is a whole community of people with valuable life experience, sharing strategies.The other part is something close to my heart-  it often feels like all the yoga/meditation/CBT/various other skills in the world are not enough to fight against this strong response that takes over my body and mind.I spent nearly a year tormented by a situation that caused me huge pain and this is exactly what I found.  I felt ""fobbed-off"" by being told to use such strategies for my feelings and unmanageable thoughts which I couldn't 'let go' of, day or night.  They didn't work and it wasn't for lack of trying. This was an additional form of invalidation for me.  The answer I finally found was neuro-biological.  I became dangerously suicidal in not just feeling overwhelmed by the torment (and that word is not hyperbole) but by not being allowed to even talk about the feelings and situation that triggered them.  It was damaging in itself so be so hurt, and additionally blamed because the so-called cure didn't work for me.One of the things I came to understand for myself, was the reason that I felt continually invalidated and discounted.   In having been de-selfed by abuse, I lost myself when I was with other people.  The situation that brought things to a crisis was the result of a lifetime of escalating self-abandonment.  I needed to change how I experienced myself, and how I responded to interpersonal discrediting and abusive behaviour. No amount of attending to my breath was ever going to provide a solution.  Even if the strategy worked, I would continue to be snowed with more and more painful, destabilising situations that I would need to 'breathe into'.  Which isn't a solution.I hope you can find a solution that works for you - for both problems."
527,"This has been a challenge for me. It filters into my home life as well, causing disruption for my husband and me. Finally, hubby BEGGED me to leave work at work and *be* home with him when I'm home. I try, but those conversations still replay - like you said, as they actually happen, as I wish they'd happened and how I hope I can be strong enough to make them happen. If it helps to know you are not alone, then I can assure you - YOU ARE NOT ALONE! I ended up confronting the invalidating coworkers (both times, scared to death I'd end up fired for standing up for myself). Both times, I ended up in Personnel, but both times, my complaint was validated. Both times, I felt vindicated by the HR director. True, I got drug tested both times, too (because I'm usually seen as a happy calm person, but those days, I shouted). My big recommendation - if you do confront, don't shout. LOLBIG HUGS - that stinks and I so understand EXACTLY how that feels. It isn't one really ugly statement, it's a series of little undercuts, little invalidations, little doubts. I didn't have to consider the sexist angle, though - both of the bullies I faced down were fellow women. Yes, I do consider that kind of constant needling to be a form of bullying. It does sound to me as if you're dealing with a sexist bully. He's just nice enough about it that you are doubting if he means it. If it's been going on more than a week, he means it. And, I'd be willing to bet he has an agenda (get overheard enough times 'correcting' you and you not stopping it - that's the proof that you are accepting his 'authority' over you). I wish I could tell you how best to fix this situation. I believe, in my humble opinion, that your human resources director may need to get involved. Before heading down that path, if you choose it, practice what you're going to say a lot. I know, re-hashers do that ALL the time! But, speaking up for yourself doesn't come naturally to you, so you'll likely react with blushes, stutters and other signs that we know are distress, but others can write off as lying, exaggerating or being 'overly emotional'. (Ugh, I hate that term). MORE BIG HUGS! I hate that you're going through this. I can say that, on the other side of the confrontation, life is much calmer and I do find myself needing to re-hash conversations far less often. "
528,"Next time he asks if you need help, tell him ""When I need an Engineering 101 refresher course, I'll call ya.""   Its sexism, and should not be put up with.  I've dealt with a lot of it in my life.  "
529,"Thanks for all the replies. I probably should have replied earlier and said, I'm not really looking so much for advice on how to fix the situation, but more about the imaginary conversations and letting go of those thoughts. It's like radical said, both problems need a solution. But actually dealing with the coworker, while unpleasant and stress-inducing to do, I know *how* to do at least. I would use the interpersonal skills from DBT and talk to him directly. While I haven't done it yet, I know it is an option and something I'm very willing to do if it comes to it.The other piece of it -- calming the mind and body down from the anxious thoughts of the conversations that happened or might have happened but didn't -- that's the piece I didn't even know *how* to solve. It's interesting, one of the main reasons why I was prompted to post about it is because of the insomnia piece. I feel like I can tolerate uncomfortable thoughts and anxiety, but when it interferes with my sleep, then the consequences become unbearable. I'm really not good with sleep deprivation, which is unfortunate because I need a lot of sleep ideally, and I have insomnia so easily, due to trauma and anxiety.Anyway, I started seeing a sleep therapist a couple of weeks ago who specializes in patients with PTSD who have insomnia. I told her about my concern about how getting triggered -- by anything, not just this specific manifestation of anxiety -- will affect my ability to sleep. I told her how I do meditation and breathing and all this stuff, but it often feels like it's not enough. She agreed, just breathing alone isn't enough to calm down from the stress response, which was validating to me. (And I just want to SCREAM when people tell me to just ""let it go"" or ""just relax"" when stuff comes up that is triggering to me -- AUGH. So there, you were wrong, everyone who ever said that to me! But that's a whole rant for another thread...) She gave me a little device that tracks your pulse and guides you into deep breathing in order to trigger the relaxation response, but there is more to it than just breathing. It's kind of hard to explain. Anyway, I'm supposed to practice using that and then maybe I will get better at it.But anyway, I have slept better since sleep therapy started. It made me realize, a lot of why these triggering incidents have so much effect on me is not only the initial anxious/angry reaction, but then the loss of sleep, and then all the effects from that afterwards. It's like a domino effect. If I could still sleep well even after being triggered, everything would be a lot more manageable. It's made me see this in a whole other perspective. I think that once I get a better handle on my sleep, I'll be in a much better position to manage the rest of my anxiety.Also, I want to say thank you once again, because it just feels good knowing I can post about this and others know what it's like to experience what I'm going through. Not that I'm glad that you suffer with it too, but we can all support each other this way and know we are not alone. Most of the people in my life just don't get it (as I mentioned above, with the ""let it go"" advice and such). *hugs to everyone*"
530,"hey, a_bunny,repeating conversations, inventing conversations, going over and over in my head what i wish i would have said, what i wish i could say, what i want to say has been tormenting me and my sleep for years and years!  my latest has been thinking of my ex's funeral, and how much i'd love to get up to the podium and tell everyone what a buttwipe he really was, cuz all they ever saw was this guy who was an entertainer (i did get a suggestion for that - to have a mock funeral, stand up in front of pretend people and say it all out loud.  i am going to do that, see if it helps)anyway, i totally hear you about the 'let it go', 'leave it be', kinds of things i've been told.  don't you think that if i could i would?  that's not how i'm wired, tho, and i have to find another way.  2 things that have helped a bit have been the idea of 'revisiting' (from van der kolk's book, 'the body keeps the score') these people who have traumatized me, who i've eliminated from my life, and to whom i've not gotten any sense of validation or understanding for what went on between us.  i know i won't ever get that, logically - it's the nature of the beast - but it's an old thought pattern that if i only said things 'the right way' i could get the idea across to them so they'd understand.so, 'revisiting' is putting myself in harm's way over and over, basically.  it does me no good, it solves nothing, and i come away from it tired, frustrated, and unsatisfied.  i'm hurting myself by doing it.  to stop it, or at least lessen it, i've been practicing saying 'STOP!' whenever i catch myself doing it.  or telling myself that i'm revisiting again.  often that will break that awful cycle of thought, and i mentally look for something positive to think about, or do some repetitive relaxation stuff starting at my toes and working my way up my body.  that's helped on several occasions.the other thing that's helped me is when i saw the movie 'a beautiful mind'.  our hero had hallucinations and he learned to live with them by acknowledging them, saying good-by to each imaginary person, and finally ignoring them by basically telling them that they are not on the menu for him to indulge in anymore.  that was very powerful to me - a mind over mind dynamic.  and a true story to boot - he went on to win a nobel prize.  so i knew it was do-able.this has also helped me a lot.  when the conversations threaten, i mentally tell them they're not on the menu anymore, and i can usually stop them.  i'd say it works at least 75% of the time, while revisiting works pretty much the other 25%.  it's not been perfect, but so much better than it had been.i do hope you find something that works for you and gives you some relief.  these mental conversations have been horrible, i know.  best to you with this.  "
531,"This is a very good post a_bunny. I agree, the calming strategies work for me when I am already calm. But when the trigger comes, forget it.Going to keep thinking on this. In my mind, the bottom line is stopping the thoughts, not working with them... just realised the first line of this paragraph, ha.I do like Candid's broken record suggestion and think there could be some validity to it. Although it is a strategy for dealing directly with *Fred*, to me its might be a good way to shut the door on those thoughts beginning, as per Sanmagic's beautiful mind.I have to admit I do say ""thanks i'll keep that in mind"" as a non aggressive and diffusive mechanism. This way I can ignore, and even stop listening to what they are saying, let them talk to themselves for a bit before I ask questions about their own work to take their focus off mine, do my work my way, and pretend I weighed up their suggestions if there is a follow up.It does seem like a long drawn out process, but to me, in my experience, if they think they are controlling my work, it is in fact me that is controlling their behaviour. Over time they should leave you alone, and if they leave you alone there's no trigger for the thoughts.I don't know a_bunny. My brain has been in a complete whirr for years and i'm just remembering the old strategies I used to use pre-trauma. They have been working for me lately to quell the over analyses, and I am now back in control. Remembering as I write.So bottom line, with everything I just said, feel free to ""keep it in mind""  "
532,"Quote from: radical on March 05, 2017, 04:00:26 PMI needed to change how I experienced myself, and how I responded to interpersonal discrediting and abusive behaviour.I forgot, I had meant to reply to this point as well. This reminded me of something that had been helpful to me. I realized that when I'm having any kind of anxious trigger response, the repeated conversations in this case, there is an emotion driving that response, and an emotion that responds to it as well. The imaginary conversations are most likely prompted by fear, so I would try to talk to that fear inside myself, ask it what it is feeling and why, thank it for trying to protect me from some perceived threat, and reassure it that it is safe. The response to the imaginary conversations might be some sort of frustration, or perhaps stress over losing sleep, so I would talk to that part also, in a similar way, and reassure it that it's OK to have the thoughts, there's nothing wrong with me, and validate that it's uncomfortable to go through.Validation is such a big issue for me. Something I try to remind myself is that when I feel invalidated by others, and I'm in a trigger response because my need of validation isn't getting met, the most important thing I can do is validate myself.Quote from: sanmagic7 on March 11, 2017, 02:36:22 PMthe other thing that's helped me is when i saw the movie 'a beautiful mind'.  our hero had hallucinations and he learned to live with them by acknowledging them, saying good-by to each imaginary person, and finally ignoring them by basically telling them that they are not on the menu for him to indulge in anymore.  that was very powerful to me - a mind over mind dynamic.  and a true story to boot - he went on to win a nobel prize.  so i knew it was do-able.OMG, this movie really resonated for me as well!! I actually forgot about the specifics of how he said goodbye to each imaginary person, that is so powerful. Thank you so much for reminding me of this. I will try this.Again, thanks for everyone's replies, it is helpful!"
533,"Hi a_bunny. I totally hear you. And similar to you, I've been in years of good help and therapy, and done well with it. However, only this year did I learn how to respond in the moment. And in learning how to do that, the nighttime replaying of conversations in my mind has largely disappeared. In other words, I had to learn the skills of standing up kindly to bullies and difficult people. I thought I was too intimidated to learn, but I learned.All it took was watching a few youtube videos by a guy named Dan O'Connor. This guy is soooo helpful. Once I started imitating what he says to do, I became empowered in a new way. Here's one example, but look around on youtube for the videos by Dan O'Connor that suit you best: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuvNW1RnRjgI hope this is helpful to you"
534,"And welcome to you, biggerfish2! Thanks for the video. "
535,"I know that any critical thing said to narc will make him wig out.But I really want to give CONSTRUCTIVE criticism to him, so I want to phase in a VERY SOFT way.Is this possible?  I have to try.This man is hurt, and his hurt was caused by being embarrassed by my behavior.  Basically what I did was run out of a church at the end of service... basically a panic attack.But I know that if your embarrassed by SOMEONE ELSES behavior, you consider the person to be an extension of yourself... not a person in their own right.  If he could see me as a person in my own right he would not be so embarrassed.Also being embarrassed means you're afraid of being JUDGED.  This fear seems to permeate every aspect of his life.Perhaps someone would has narc-like tendencies would be able to phrase this to another narc."
536,"Others may have better ideas, but my gut feeling is narcs don't listen to anything they don't want to hear, and not only will any criticism not be tolerated, it will also provoke N-rage. Tread warily if this is an important relationship -- and if it isn't, why would you put yourself in the firing line?"
537,"The only way that I've ever been able to get a narc to even pretend to hear me has been to make them consider that not hearing me will make them look bad to other people. (My M is a covert narc, so I have lots of experience.)QuotePerhaps someone would has narc-like tendencies would be able to phrase this to another narc.I don't think this ever happens. Sorry to hear that you had to leave church because of a panic attack. It seems like you know that the proper response of someone else to that would be concern for your well-being, rather than worry about what other people think about them. "
538,"Thanks for your responses Candid and mourningdove.The thought occurred to me that he probably doesn't even know that pain... the embarrassment... comes his childhood abuse, and may that's where I should start.He has just recently realized the magnitude of his childhood abuse.   He when home for a funeral this past Nov. and saw the abuse up close again.  On the ACES score he has more than me.  And I told him that. So I wrote an email comparing our two pains... my panic attack and his embarrassment... and said there are both not normal and come from our abuse.  I speculated that the treatment for his pain was to understand the underlying reasons.That might have been too harsh for a narc... to say that he should treat his pain.  But we'll see."
539,"best to you with this, laurelleaves.  please be careful - there may be backlash.   my experience echoes that of the others - narcs don't want to hear anything a critical about themselves, and will often justify and/or deny their behavior.  sorry about your panic attack.  i agree with mourningdove that a caring person would be concerned about your well-being first.  hoping it works out well for you.    "
540,"Yes sanmagic7, there may be backlash.   But I've been with him 22 years and he's never physically hurt me.  And I am aware of how he acts now.  He's very predicable in his arguments.  All I have to be is unemotional about it.  And I am a type who's good at being unemotional... most times.So far he is not responding.  That could mean he is seething about what I said.  But he knows an emotional attack won't take me out.  So if he's going to respond, it gotta be from a logical place.  That's takes time.   Time enough for him to consider if what I said was true. He's a covert narc.  I never imagined people were like him until I married him.  But I see now why I married him: to take the place of my parents... to do it right this time.  "
541,"Hi LaurelLeavesI think I may be late to this, but saw the title of this thread and thought 'that's not possible'.Hope you are okay xo"
542,"Hi Contessa,I'm okay.  He never emailed back.  And right now he's just cordial.I'm hopeful that he is just borderline instead of NPD, and he can learn to be better.He has gotten better, and I think he may be realizing that there is actually something wrong with him.  I'm not just sure if I have the capacity to wait for him anymore.  "
543,It sounds like you're tired of regulating every behaviour and emotion expressed for the appeasement of another's ego.Time to focus on you?
544,"Yes, I know...  But the thing is, it's getting easier.  I know I'm getting stronger, but I'm sure it's getting easier because he's getting calmer.    I'm just so exhausted and angry from the  previous years...  I know... trying to wait for a borderline to learn is kinda like trying to save a person who's drowning.   Working on my financial independence in case this relationship falls apart.   "
545,Smart move LaurelLeaves.Glad you have a plan in place 
546,"Hello all,Long story short, assassination of my character is in full swing at my workplace. Crazymaking by ex - my asking how he was doing started with him abusing me, a huge argument, and ended with a psychologist calling me to make an appointment to assess my mental health  The behaviour of several people has changed toward me. It is avoidant and cautious.So. I refuse to run away. This is my workplace, my career, my reputation. These are my colleagues, and friends being turned against me. I do not and will not accept this.I do have a plan to work through this in non confrontational way, and my therapist is on my side with the plan. They have noted that this guy is a possible sociopath. Right now my reputation is going down hill, and I expect it to continue until people have seen enough of me, and continue to see me, to question what they have heard.Has anybody else had experience in this area? Any words of wisdom for working through this and coming out the victor?"
547,"Yes.Not from an ex.  I'd tread very warily.   It might pay to look up bully-online to check out the tactics that may be being used now or in the future, also for advice for how to deal with it.  It's great that your are onto this at an early stage and commiserate with the pain of former friends backing away.  I admire your fortitude.  Take care XX"
548,"Hi Contessa,  I can't say I have any good ideas. Character assassination is something I have experienced in my FOO, but I have never been able to successfully thwart it. That's why I'm here, I suppose. Quote from: Contessa on September 10, 2016, 10:54:34 PMSo. I refuse to run away. This is my workplace, my career, my reputation. These are my colleagues, and friends being turned against me. I do not and will not accept this.I do have a plan to work through this in non confrontational way, and my therapist is on my side with the plan. They have noted that this guy is a possible sociopath. This all sounds excellent. The support from your T is great, and probably it's a good idea to keep her well in the loop. And to discuss with her when and where the plan needs to be adjusted. Because it will have to be adjusted, as new developments arise. These changes might be subtle, or large, and at times new developments will tell you both: ""Right! We stick to our plan. This is what we expected.""I recently saw a VLOG titled ""Give the narcissist sociopath enough rope and he'll hang himself"". The content of the video is irrelevant to your case, but I think the title is. And I know this from personal experience, though only in hindsight.It's all the 'tells' that my DramaMama has given me because I was avoidant and 'meek' at the time and let her ramble on, that in the end provided me with all the clues I needed to tell she's a HPD.Probably the sociopath at work will do the same for your colleagues to notice. If they will notice his 'tells' or not... not much you can do to influence that.This Vlog might actually have some bearing on what you will be going through the next period:When Dealing with a Narcissist Sociopath, Patience Is More Than Virtue. It's Strategy.edited to add the subtitle of the vid is: The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting. ― Sun Tzu, The Art of WarWhich fits with your ""non-confrontational"" plan, I think. 15:55 (16:20) to 19:40 may fit into the strategy youve drawn up, and may be predictive of what will happen.  Wishing you well, and please do post any updates if you feel it will aid you in this smear campaign he's pulling on you."
549,"Thank you so much guys! All of this started because I stood up for myself. That's it. If there is an issue I address it. I'm not used to keeping quiet.I have a superior colleague keeping an eye/ear out for things that may be happening, though there will be little chance of hearing anything much. His direct manager has gone from being nice to me one day, to not the next. So I've asked my colleague to keep an ear out for anything that might be communicated from her. I obviously cannot approach his manager, as this will confirm my 'crazyness' with her.My superior colleague has noted his aggressively defensive nature in meetings, so she can see that my concerns have a legitimate basis. I also have a friend who's aiding me to keep socially present with my friends and colleagues. I ask her not only to keep me in the loop, but arrange certain social gatherings with particular people present. This to me is the most important part, I have to stay involved with as many people as possible so they can get to know me from me (not him) and have a reasonable chance to question what they are hearing when my behaviour does not match what he has described to them. I have already failed with that argument that we had, it just gave him more fuel against me.This is not easy, being emotionally and socially abused by him in private, then in the next day or so hear from one of my close friends that ""he has asked after me and just wants me to get better, and wishes things weren't awkward between us"". I'm not sick, I'm being abused.Will update you all, and especially thank you for those links Dutch Uncle. It is indeed a subtle game. I'm just recovering from a huge episode (caused by him), and so my change in behaviour - being more socially involved and temperamentally positive - is an anomaly right now. Unfortunately, it is my natural, non-PTSD temperament. Unfortunate because nobody in this work place has ever seen this. My T and I both agree that this new behaviour of mine must stay consistent. Though given that this is my natural behaviour, its not too hard too keep up with.Its odd. I feel like the only way I can survive this is to 'not be traumatised' if that makes sense. I have to stay level, I have to take the higher road, I have to stay present, I have to stay immersed in social culture. If I withdraw, he wins. If i'm triggered, he wins. Oddly, this negative event is helping me to find myself again..."
550,"Quote from: Contessa on September 11, 2016, 02:22:20 PMAll of this started because I stood up for myself. [...] Oddly, this negative event is helping me to find myself again...I can relate.It's hard to get this backlash for doing so, but I firmly belief it's the one step forward that will reap so much rewards in the (distant) future, that no matter how this will turn out, it will have been worth it.Of course the rewards will pour in sooner than you expect.   :fingers crossed: "
551,"Radical, yes thank you too. Have been researching quite a bit.Another strange thing, this type of bullying was something I was passionate about in my classroom. If I caught a hint of this happening with any of my students, all lessons would stop, and would not start again until those kids knew to not only stop the bullying, but do whatever they could to redeem themselves to the victim. At the end of the year I was complimented by staff and parents for how emotionally and socially well adjusted and stable my kids were. And now I'm the victim of the very thing I despise... Its a weird place to be I tell you."
552,"I feel for you.  My sister was disabled and endured such cruel bullying in school.  Like you I have always despised bullying.  Good for you making the classroom a safe place for everyone.  It would have made a difference to so many children, and I really wish more teachers understood, intervened and educated their students.For me, it instilled a lifelong fear of being ostracised, and afraid of incurring the wrath of a group.  My bullying experience was intense because we were building a community, and I was being set-up to be mobbed by the entire group by a malignant narc who had taken control.  Being rejected triggered more than I could cope with.  I knew I had to walk into it and keep establishing an alternative view of who I was, but I became too depressed and withdrew.  I couldn't bear my closest friend refusing to even say hello, people believing the lies, seeing people I cared about back off, not even want to sit near me, or be seen to be associating with me.  My worst fear was coming true before my eyes and I couldn't respond, I was paralysed by it.You are doing all the right things and I really admire your strength and clarity. "
553,"Dutch Uncle,Just watched the Vlog. The salient point that I have now learnt the hard way, is to not just go no contact with the narc, but refuse to defend yourself against the accusations, from them or anyone else. I understand completely what Annabel Lee means by that.Thank you again radical. Very sorry to hear about what you have experienced. Absolutely disgusting. About to have my first day teaching in a few months tomorrow. Looking forward to it. In the latest news, a friend connected to this guy is not even trying to pretend to be polite to me anymore. Its strange playing dumb to something that is so obvious, I dare not ask if something is the matter. Oh well, onward and hopefully upward. "
554,"Update:Its been about two weeks now and things are settling. The initial phase of ""people not talking to me"" has settled into its routine. I have persistently kept up the pretense that I know nothing, and have continued to behave toward those that changed their behaviour to me, the same as usual.The guy who wasn't pretending to be nice to me, is now being somewhat diplomatic. At times I can feel a hint of warmness.Another guy who had the awkward smile and giggle when I said hello to him, is now getting more comfortable with my greetings, and has started to look, smile and wave to me as I approach him.Neither of them make an effort to make contact with me, and I have still not been included in anything social around here by them, but that's okay. Its  a small step forward.Opportunistically, I have spent a few hours chatting with the girl whom the douche was working on while seeing me, and there appear to have been some very loaded topics of conversation on both our parts which touch on the unspoken with this guy / our values in general. The values I expressed, and the behaviour I have presented around other people in her presence, in no way align to what has been projected onto me by the douche. I have even offered her a professional heads up. She is very young and therefore naive in some respects, which explains why she has been sucked in by him. It seems though, that she is keen to see for herself what I am like and make up her own mind, and I know she is very capable of that. Again, small steps, but its a step forward.The douche seems to now be spending minimal time here at the office - although I have had other things happening too so cannot be entirely sure of his movements. More importantly, I do not care. Tomorrow night, though, a very good friend of mine has invited us both to a social gathering, the friend I introduced each other too, and the douche is apparently going to be in attendance. I'm hoping he has actually done his usual thing of telling friends he is free and willing to hang out without any intention of showing up. It will remain to be seen. Whatever happens, I'm going to be hanging out with my buddy tomorrow night and will enjoy the catch up.I will triumph."
555,  and   
556,"Massive Kudos, Contessa.And thanks for making me smile "
557,"Thank you Dutch Uncle and Radical. I do feel so much more at ease and in control of myself now. If he does show up tomorrow I am looking forward owning the room and making more friends. He can just deal with it, or not, as the case may be."
558,"So the party happened, the douche did show up, and last night I did own the room like I planned.Our mutual friends - the ones he used to bag out to me in private months ago, and for one social gathering I organised a few months ago he wanted cancelled because he didn't want to spend his time associating with those space cadets/retards/psychologically screwed up people - stepped out for a little bit before he arrived. He saw me, we both did not acknowledge each other's existence, and he immediately asked after those friends, inquiring as to whether they were there, or were coming. He seemed very anxious to hang out with them, and when they did eventually come back, he did. All night. And treated them like his best buddies.He spoke to my buddy, kept his back to me the entire time, and eventually pulled him away to another table, away from me and my buddy's wife, where there was obviously plenty of room to sit. So when my buddy's wife got a drink, I did not engage in conversation with these two. When she came back, I took the opportunity to fill her in on plenty of details about the douche (including what he said about on of their friends the last time we all hung out), and she decided then and there that after last night, she and her husband were no longer going to be friends with the douche. She also told me she thought he was a *** the last time they met anyway.So after I pulled my buddy back into a conversation with me and his wife, and I worked the room and made friends with all of his other buddies, the douche had no option but to hang out with the former 'retards', now best friends of his. He also had the option to talk to my buddy's buddy's girlfriends, but remembering his attitude toward me as a woman, the idea of getting into conversation with them might have been a repulsive option.I also interacted with other patrons of the bar we were at, as well as bar staff in an overtly friendly manner, which is something i don't normally do. I was determined to be friends with everybody in the room, haha.We had a little power play against each other later in the night, just a little one. Might explain later, but its not necessary at the moment. Plus I can't be bothered - this whole recounting minute details of every story is very tiresome to me, and it makes me feel just as big an insecure narcissist/mean person/gossip like he is. So I won't get into it. I said to the former 'space cadet' that I was having a great time and loving life in general with his inquiry, which was immediately followed by the douche telling my buddy that he was going well but went through a some kind of awful rough patch a few weeks ago which was unsettling and distressing (meaning our particular argument and everything that happened around it).As I was leaving with another bunch of people, he left with his new 'best friends'. He only talked to one of my buddy's friends all night. I also had my buddy with me most of the night too, so their time together was somewhat minimal. I do not feel triumphant here, I feel just as big a manipulator by recounting this story back, but that was not really the case. He came nowhere near me all night, whereas I moved in and out of the room with various groups of people throughout the night, including his little group at times. I would even interrupt his conversation from across the room by pulling faces with the guy he was talking to. I was just there to catch up with my friend, our mutual friends, and meet his friends, which is what I did.But there it is. I have no idea if/what would happen with the my friend's wife and her husband/my buddy, but I will be interested to know if anything comes of it.I'll admit, this was tiresome to write. It felt like a child telling stories about a kid in class because they just don't like them, and will find any excuse to rub their name in the dirt. And I'm not okay with that. I just want to get on with my life without this stupidity and abuse. I feel like I am the abuser now. But I thought i'd follow up with how this thing went if it is of any interest / use for anyone else here.Take care all, and hopefully this is near the end of the ridiculous drama."
559,"for your sake, i hope so as well.  i, for one, am glad that you rose above your 'character assassination', survived it, and ended up thriving, rekindling friendships along the way.  as far as relating this story, maybe it needed to come out in order to be laid to rest.  it's done now, you've made it, and forward ho!  "
560,"Okay, so I am not out of the woods yet. Didn't think I would be.Turns out the 'space cadet' is hosting a massive barbeque tomorrow, and absolutely everyone has been invited. Everyone but me.My friend has asked whether I can come along, and he has told her to invite me herself, he's too busy to do it, etc. Given that he has taken the time to return several messages to her, and not spend less effort actually inviting me himself, this tells me i'm still well ant truly in the red.Sigh. This is very frustrating.This guy has always been nice to me. Do you think it is worth touching base with him to ask if everything is okay?"
561,"  I'm looking for some idea of what a ""normal""  or healthy action to take in my situation. I am in a geographical area where the abuse rates are double the rest of the state and the state is in the top area of percentages of other states. The culture is to me an abusive culture and they seem to have no idea what abuse actually entails. And that's just the medical professionals. I'm witnessing ethical mishandling of others'  and my own personal medical info and when/if I speak up my doctor becomes very threatening with mislabeling me and withholding medication and firing me as a patient. It has taken me 6 years to get any treatment so I am put in such a position that I put up and shut up or I suffer the damages of no treatment at all. I often find here that if you need any help at all the price is disempowerment.  I already have injury from lack of access to treatment options and my sense of integrity is greater than most. If I try to be reporting this anonymously it will still be too obviously me.  I hate that I'm in this position once again. It seems my life's work is to be put where I can see wrongdoing, due to my hyper vigilant mindfulness (superpower) of when things aren't right and harm is in the air.  I've tried all the normal actions in the past but the gaslighting of whistleblowers is their go to medical  decision. It's one thing to defend only myself but many others are being violated by the disregard of morals ethics and values. If i am to live I need the access to medical help.  So? Any thoughts? My conscience is hurting here!"
562,"my heart aches for you, cd.   i was in a position of not getting medications in a timely manner, and i ended up writing a letter to the director of our clinic, the director of the clinic in charge of ours, and the person in charge of the pharmacy at the other clinic (from which our meds were sent).  it was about psych meds, so i did some research and included notations about the possibility of suicide if not receiving meds regularly, etc., and that they would be liable if anything happened to me.  yes, others were being affected as well, but at the time i was focused on me.  we all benefitted, tho, because after that the monthly allotment of psych meds. came on a regular basis.  i don't know if that's something you can do, or something similar.  the idea that you can't report this without dire consequences is appalling to me.  i hate that b.s.   i hope you can find a way to get what you need without more harm to you.    wishing you all the best with this.  "
563,"Hi Calex - So sorry to hear you are having such a difficult time, it makes me  and that is a very normal and healthy reaction  .   You do need care but it should never be at the expense of your rights, dignity and health. There is some information and links here that can help hopefully - http://outofthefog.net/C-PTSD/forum/index.php?topic=2518.0.   This one looks it would provide some good advice/help:""Is There Something Wrong or Questionable in Your Treatment?""  by Dr. Estelle Disch. This article is one of many resources at a site called the Therapy Exploitation Link Line  (TELL) for those who have been harmed in a therapeutic relationship (primarily in the United States and Australia).

564,Thank you for your help kizzie you are a true star 💫
565,"Quote from: sanmagic7 on April 11, 2017, 12:05:37 AMthe idea that you can't report this without dire consequences is appalling to me.  i hate that b.s.   For me, it's too reminiscent of what went on in FOO. Suggest to someone outside FOO that M was abusing me? Cue narcissistic rage, and it will be devastating because no one knows better than M how to get to me. I'm SO glad I cut that off.I hate these situations of vulnerability, especially when looking for therapeutic help."
566,"CPTSD is my primary diagnosis, in that it pre-dated normal childhood illnesses and has had the greatest impact on my life. I also have an Acquired Brain Injury from when I fell off my bike going downhill and landed on my head, requiring reconstructive surgery for my face, in and out of hospital for about five months.Today I went to my second meeting of an ABI support group. They're all good people with the same distressing and bewildering symptoms of brain injury. Some of the information given excluded me (eg. enlisting family support) and I made up my mind to talk to someone afterwards.I told one of the group convenors (not psychologically trained) I had complex PTSD, and explained the difference between run-of-the-mill and C thusly: PTSD is an incident, CPTSD is a whole life. He was very understanding and asked how I felt about being in the group.I said I was fine with the discussions and round-table contributing; it was when we took a break that I was in trouble. Not the first time this has happened to me: I look around the room and everyone's talking to someone else while I'm clutching my coffee cup and feeling like a prat. Eventually it got too much for me and I left the building with my cigarettes. Found I couldn't get back in through the door I'd exited, walked round to the main door, a crowd of people in the foyer, finding the door to the stairs, and back into the meeting room where of course they'd started up again.I don't talk to people. I can take brief encounters but I feel myself edging away as soon as they start. This comes across as rudeness or not liking the person who's waylaid me. I simply don't know where to start in conversation, much less keep it going. Nor do I feel inclined to tell anyone: ""My mother was horrible to me, I have CPTSD and I act weirdly sometimes."" Who wants to know that?Anyway, the break was a very short time in a two-hour meeting, and I enjoyed it overall. It feels good to be among people other than H and MIL. There are ten weekly meetings to go and I expect to be at all of them. Suggestions are welcome, although right now (and in the long walk home) I'm telling myself: It's okay to be the way I am. Of course I'll talk if someone talks to me. It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. It wouldn't matter if I never talked to another living soul for the rest of my life.Reminds me of a work trip to Japan some years ago with a group of people in the same industry but from around the world. We constituted an odd number, and shared hotel rooms were allocated. People were whooping and laughing and high-fiving their new roomies and I sat there trying to look casual, knowing all the time who would have a room to herself. Lucky me, right?"
567,"first meetings can always be difficult.  i'm glad it was an overall pos. experience and that you'll be going back.  i've never been one for initiating small talk, either, so i understand that discomfort.  i'm glad you went.  another good thing under your belt.  plus, like you said, a break from the others in your life.  well done!"
568,"I can relate to your problems with break-time. Congratulations for going to the group at all, knowing that there might be a problem like that."
569,"I fee that. I also have C-ptsd with an acquired brain injury though. I envy your courage as I have never made it to the brain injury support group in my area.. It seems I always feel so different from everyone else that I don't fit in (in my mind anyway). It also seems others don't meet my definition of safe. The brain injury really set me off on  a down road. I have in the past found if you keep at it, things get more comfortable. I hope you keep going. Dealing with the BI on your own is not easy. My heart is with you. "
570,"Quote from: Calex Deeply on March 29, 2017, 01:46:30 AMThe brain injury really set me off on  a down road.It still feels like the last straw that broke my spirit in a life full of trauma, chiefly because after the accident I was misdiagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, locked up, and on enforced psych meds until I left the country to be free of them. The hospital I was kept in for several weeks had a policy of waking people every hour or so to make sure we hadn't killed ourselves. That set recovery back a lot, on top of what Pete Walker calls a ""stigmatizing label"". The ABI group has become the highlight of my dull weeks and I even think I may have made a friend there.  How long ago was your accident/stroke? It's 18 months for me now and I'm still not 'me'. From what I'm hearing, I may be stuck with this. I do urge you to get along to the support group, though. I too always feel like an outsider, but in a group setting you can watch people for a while and decide whether they're 'safe'.Thanks for the good wishes, everyone.  "
571,"I have a really hard time with this. I swing between keeping all my emotions inside and using the people close to me as ""emotional dumpsters"". There is no in between for me. It makes me really sad, cuz I know that it can turn manipulative, which I don't want to be at all! I'm scared that I'm gonna turn out like F   I'm terrified that I'll turn manipulative  I know I'm not doing it intentionally, but... I don't even know how to healthily express my negative emotions. In my childhood I was taught that I wasn't allowed to have negative emotion, so things build up inside me until they explode. I don't know what I'm saying here, but I realized this and it's scaring me "
572,"I understand and relate to this 100%, joyful. I wasn't allowed to have negative emotions either as a kid. It sounds to me like you are on the right track. I mean, there are a lot of people who don't even know that they do this. You know that the tendency is there, so you can work on changing it. And there is nothing to be ashamed of, because you know that this happens because of not having been able to have negative emotions as a kid. That reflects negatively only on your caretaker(s). It's not your fault.  "
573,"Joyful, I can understand and relate, though in my FOO things were a bit different in that emotions usually seen as positive weren't allowed either, no, they were ridiculed.    I'd say that the first step is being aware that there's a problem. You've done the first step already   . Bit by bit you'll find ways in between the two extremes and be able to build on these middle ways. "
574,"Quote from: joyful on March 23, 2017, 04:06:53 PMI don't even know how to healthily express my negative emotions.Classic assertiveness involves telling the other person what you feel about their speech or actions. Examples:When you laugh at me I feel hurt.When you go out in the evening I feel abandoned.When you leave the dishes for me to do I feel angry.Of course it feels unnatural, and it was unimaginable when we were children. It has to be learned and practised, perhaps worded in a less stilted way -- as long as it describes the problem and names the feeling.I was upset when I realised you'd opened my mail.And never let anyone tell you ""You shouldn't feel that way"". Feelings are spontaneous, and all of yours are as valid as anyone else's. The beauty of assertiveness is that it's the mildest form of confrontation, it boosts self-esteem, it prevents 'things' festering in relationships ... and it starts chipping away at long-held grievances because we realise we can stand up for ourselves."
575,"hey, joyful, i can relate.one thing that's helped me with not dumping neg. emotions on people has been to write them out, like in an anger journal or a letter that i'm not gonna send.  getting it out of me was, for me, the very most important part.  on paper or the screen, i could let fly every word that came to mind, whether it was cussing, name-calling, whatever.after getting the crud out this way, where it wouldn't hurt anyone, i was more prepared to present my emotions in a rational, assertive way to another person if that's what i wanted to do.  i think it also gave me some extra strength to be able to do so.  best to you with this.  being real by expressing our thoughts and feelings goes a long way to being true to ourselves, i think.  big hug, joyful."

577,"My uNPD father keeps pushing me to speak to him on the phone. I dont want to speak to him on the phone because he is passive aggressive and my anxiety does not need it. I feel better off not speaking to him. The digestive problems I have every single time I deal with him are testament to that. He sent me a text message asking to speak on the phone after already being told that I prefer to communicate by email and text message. Ive reiterated again that text message and email is the best way to communicate with me. He responded asking whats going on with me and calling me rude. I responded just now saying that Im sorry he feels that way but I dont think Im being rude, Im just not comfortable talking on the phone at this present time and Im asking for that to be respected. I finished the message off telling him that it neednt be a drama. Now the ingrained shame response is kicking in. Am I being rude? Treating a normal, rational person the way I am him would be rude but my father invented rude. I could have retaliated listing a whole bunch of things hes done which are rude (usual narc things: belittling others behind their backs, shaming, not phoning me for 3 months!) but I didn't because that would be attacking him and the whole point of this isn't that I want to be mean to him, this really is just me wanting to protect myself and grow as a person. I think that Im starting to realise that the hold hes always had over me is the fear over how Im perceived. Im laying down a preference for my own wellbeing for the first time ever and he cant deal with that, so in his eyes for not conforming to what he has shaped me to be I'm being rude. The next challenge will be trying not to care about being called that, because my whole life has been dictated by what people think of me and the fear of saying and doing the wrong thing in case I upset people. I hate the thought that anyone could think Im being a mean person, but I think he knows that and has played on it. I've always wondered why I'm so fearful socially and I think that he has nurtured that attitude in me. I think this must be the root of my social anxiety: the belief that if I stand up to anyone or step out of line that I'm a bad person, so to avoid that I must be hypervigilant about doing and saying what other people want me to. It seems so simple. I still feel on edge and horrible though even after this revelation. I feel so alone too. I was the scapegoat child who lived alone with him for years so I got the full-on emotional attacks from him. Into adulthood I feel like I'm expected to just ignore that it all ever happened and function like a normal adult. I'm well aware that I look to other people as though I'm being rude, difficult and nasty to him but I don't feel like I can heal if I have a direct line with him verbally as I don't have the assertiveness and conversational skills to protect myself.  Really hoping I'm on the right track with the course I've chosen. The other option is to submit and miserably live in fear of phone calls from him. It just doesn't feel right to myself to do that anymore.  "
578,"I'm so sorry you're going through this, blues_cruise. I too was the scapegoat in my FOO. I'm now NC with all of them but there was a time when father, sister and brother were all putting pressure on me to spend time with my cruel mother. It nearly drove me insane, accusations from all of them, particularly Dad saying: ""You've upset your mother.""QuoteNow the ingrained shame response is kicking in. That's his legacy to you, right? Abusive parents know exactly where our pain buttons are, because they installed them.QuoteI could have retaliated listing a whole bunch of things hes done...But there's no point, because he wouldn't remember or would outright deny it, telling you you've always had a vivid imagination. That's straight out of the script NPDs all work from.  Quotethis really is just me wanting to protect myself and grow as a person. Exactly. I remember this feeling, that I could somehow have FOO on hold, get better and go back to them. It's the most pressured time.

I had criticism and remarks from all round over my social awkwardness, and so few friends that I couldn't afford to offend anyone. But eventually I realised 'no friends' was better than frenemies, and started shedding. I'm still very isolated and lonely but I don't want back the ones I shed.

It seems so simple. Simple... and soul-destroying. For too many years I had people around me I didn't trust, and they were so diverse I couldn't imagine introducing them to each other. I was a copy of A when I was with A, of B when I was with B, etc. Put them in the same space with me and who would I be? Very likely they'd end up laughing together at me. QuoteI still feel on edge and horrible though even after this revelation. I feel so alone too.You've found this forum, and you have friends here. The beauty of that is that while our stories are all different, we're all coming from the same understanding and diagnosis.

The friends I didn't shed are the ones who are most like me, and therefore bring out the best of me.QuoteI'm well aware that I look to other people as though I'm being rude, difficult and nasty to him but I don't feel like I can heal if I have a direct line with him verbally as I don't have the assertiveness and conversational skills to protect myself.

We're all behind you.Thank you Candid.   I do keep telling myself that it's no-one else's business what I do which helps a bit. I would imagine he is complaining about me to anyone who will listen but I think he's fallen out with any friends he did have or hasn't bothered maintaining friendships with them, so anyone he does complain about it to will be 'new' acquaintances who don't even know me. His former best friend who my father mistreated and took for granted for years confided in me a few years back when I bumped into him while out shopping that he thought my father had been horrible to me and he seemed genuinely concerned about how I was doing. I often focus on that conversation when I start doubting myself because blatantly it was evident to at least one person that I wasn't the nightmare child I was painted out to be.   My father hasn't even bothered trying to email me, he texts me but only to try to guilt me into speaking to him on the phone. I have an old, separate phone which I've kept just to use to communicate with him and my new phone he doesn't have the number for. This way I can check the old phone for messages when I feel strong enough and I don't feel ambushed in day to day life. You're right, it's getting harder to respond to his messages because they're nothing but pain for me. I'm only really keeping that line of communication out of obligation and guilt and I think if I'm honest with myself it's not really working out. I now fear checking it and when I do check it I'm left feeling anxious and terrible for days on end. I think I might have got to the point where I will need to ask my husband to check it for me, then he can let me know if it's anything worth responding to or whether it's a message that's going to make me uncomfortable. You're right, though I've been assertive in my response to him which I know is the right way to be, it feels so new and dangerous. I don't feel like I can turn back now though even if I wanted to because I don't want to be a doormat anymore. I reached a similar point about a year and a half ago when he hadn't contacted me for 3 months because he was guilt tripping me, then it felt so overwhelmingly bad that I extended the olive branch to him and was the first to get back in contact. When we spoke on the phone again he was passive aggressive by trying to guilt me about not calling him and not visiting his aunt who I barely know (seriously). There was no apology or any acknowledgement of wrongdoing on his part, even though he had been the one to react badly just because I had had to cancel looking after his dog for a weekend. That's where it all started! Just a simple 'no' earned me 3 months of silence in which time I pretty much had a breakdown and could not function. I hope as time goes by I do start to see this as more of a victory. At the moment I'm constantly analysing everything, even running his words over in my head in a battle where I'm trying to convince myself that I must be the bad person. I don't know why, it's just habit. I've always been the one to submit and assume the bad guy role because it stops further nastiness for a while. It's such a core reaction now that it's hard to break out of.

But eventually I realised 'no friends' was better than frenemies, and started shedding. I'm still very isolated and lonely but I don't want back the ones I shed. The ones I kept are gold.I had a 'best friend' for years in my high school/college days who constantly belittled me to make herself feel better. She would get jealous and possessive if I got friendly with anyone else and I didn't want to rock the boat and upset her, so for years she was all I had. So many years of resentment built up and when we went to separate universities it all came to a head in my own mind and I cut ties with her. Years later we reconciled, only for her to pretty much react badly again when I did something she didn't like (in this case I took a raincheck on a meeting we had planned as I had so much work to do, apparently that was a terrible thing). I realised then that frenemies just weren't worth keeping around. I think when you're submissive and tainted by abuse from parents then unfortunately people sense that and take advantage. I know exactly what you mean.

I'd like to think that if I had a child who asked me to communicate differently I would do so because I just wanted to make sure they were OK. I might be upset but I think I would reflect back on whether anything I had done might have caused them to feel uncomfortable and would let them know that I was there if they needed me. I'd like to think that any decent human being would do that. I think his complete rigidity shows how much of a negative presence he is in my life. Hehe, hopefully I'll start to feel better soon and can meet you on the dancefloor.   It's really nice to have the reassurance that what I'm doing is OK, I'm in so much doubt at the moment.

It's only starting to register that maybe other people can be wrong about such statements, particularly him. He has no moral compass and treats people with contempt so I know he's the last person I should be listening to. I only need to look at the number of friends and neighbours he's fallen out with over the years to see that.

585,"Thanks Candid.   I haven't checked my phone for any responses from him for a week and over this time I've decided to go no contact with him. It feels extreme and 'bad' but my days are entirely filled with worrying about receiving messages from him and ruminating on the past and as a result I'm completely exhausted all the time. There is absolutely nothing healthy about remaining in contact with him. It's really hard and I know it will get harder as the penny drops with him and the rest of the family, but I feel like this way I'm being true to myself and giving myself the space I need to get on with my life.

586,"Hi.I'm not much of a talker.  In fact I rarely talk.  I've said more words online than in real life.  That makes it hard to make friends.But I thought I'd made progress in becoming friends with this couple who runs the ceramic shop around here.  One is the owner and one is the manager.   I'm more friends with the manager.  Anyhoo... they asked me if I could teach a small class on how to do one of my pots.  Talk about pushing my comfort zone!  Teaching a class?  Talking to a group of PEOPLE?   Sheesh.  But I've been practicing every day for a week now... and the class is this Saturday.  I have some Xanax pills I use for emergencies, and I think this is one of them.There is this twist in the story.  When I said I'd do the class, I though everything was fine.  But now I know the couple is having marital troubles.  The manager is talking divorce.  I said I was gonna stay out of it, and be friends with both of them.  Now the manager is not coming to work anymore... I haven't seen him in a month.  I haven't talked to the owner about their troubles, and the last time I saw him I had the sense that he didn't know that the manager told me about them.  But from something I said, I think he knows now.  It just make relations with the owner a tad bit tense.  And I miss my good friend... the manager.  I see him on FB, but he is too involved with his own troubles to talk.   I miss him sooo much.   (I have a harmless crush on him; harmless because I know I won't doing anything, just dream  )Thanks for listening.  I don't have anyone else to tell.  And usually I keep everything to myself, but I'm thinking that's not good. "

589,"I was wondering if anyone is willing to share stories of explaining c-ptsd to others?I've mostly been met with a mountain of support from close friends. It's trickier when my family is involved though. It came up at Christmas and I ended up telling my mother and younger sister. I felt like I then needed to share with my older sister so she wouldn't be confused if it came up.Because most of the feelings of emotional abandonment and neglect stem directly from my mother, I will admit I spun the truth  little when explaining why I had it. Is it common to find yourself not wanting to share the true, deeper meanings with others, especially when they're closer to the situation? I mostly felt like my mother brushed it off, my younger sister decided she has it too, and my older sister, while supportive and asking what she could do to help, still tried the route of defending my mother's parenting because ""parenting is hard."" Yes, I have no doubt, but I don't see her abusing or neglecting my nephews...It feels so easy when  talking to supportive friends, but my family is like beating my head against a wall."
590,"yes, beating your head against the family door - very aptly put.i do think when dealing with the source of your c-ptsd, it's wise to be cautious.  being brushed off by your mother, and having your older sister defend what your mother did are signs, in my mind, that you've gone far enough with both of them in attempting to explain anything.  they don't want to hear it, won't be accountable, and absolutely won't 'get it'. your younger sister seems open to what went on, agreeable to acknowledging the reality of what went on.  she may be a supportive sibling in your life, one with whom you might want to have further conversations about it.  i'd still go slowly, little by little, waiting to see where she eventually goes with the whole thing.  but the other two - i think you gave it a shot and hit a dead end.  you will make no more progress there.  sad, yes, but very few abusers will stand up and admit to what they've done, what kind of impact it may have had, and want to make amends and change so that it doesn't happen again.that was pretty courageous of you to approach them at all.  good for you.  now you have a foo reality that you can deal with instead of guessing or making assumptions.  you see the reality in the way your mother treats your nephew.  that is real, and you can trust that.  best to you as you continue on your journey, rosie."

Like, ""I've got it too but I can still do this, this and this, and I don't go on about it""?Quotemy older sister, while supportive and asking what she could do to help, still tried the route of defending my mother's parenting because ""parenting is hard."" I got a similar spiel from the aforementioned relative yesterday, and I wasn't even talking about CPTSD.QuoteYes, I have no doubt, but I don't see her abusing or neglecting my nephews...I realise you're talking about your sister here, that she's a good-enough mother, but in my case I didn't see Holy Mother abusing my siblings, either. IOW, it wasn't like she didn't know better. She scapegoated me.QuoteIt feels so easy when  talking to supportive friends, but my family is like beating my head against a wall.TBH I'm wary of discussing my pathology with anyone who's a parent, because they all come out with the same spiel: ""Parenting is hard."" Yes, I acknowledge that and I knew I didn't have either the skills or the patience to take it on, so I didn't have children. My answer to that -- not that I trot it out very often -- is: ""Children know whether they're loved or not.""As to explaining CPTSD to others, just last week I came across a brilliant summing-up: PTSD (which most people know about) is a single incident. CPTSD is a whole life.Because I was traumatised by my mother while still pre-verbal, and have attracted/been attracted to traumatizing events and people ever since, this fits perfectly for me."
592,"Thank you for your insights! I'm so sorry to hear about your own situations.For me, I think it's really the fact that my Foo is so emotionally detached that all of us are unable to fully connect. I know I am loved, but I don't feel appreciated. Like, they just take my existence for granted, and never really ask how I am emotionally. (They do make sure I am well fed, clothed, etc) And of course, I can't tell them how I really feel, given past examples. So basically, I can keep the peace and exist with them and laugh and have a good time, but I can't have a bad day around them. And that's not really living.I know each of them has their own issues to deal with. My mother had a terrible upbringing  (not that that's an excuse), I'm pretty sure my younger sister has undiagnosed Aspergers, and my older (step) sister's own birth mom died when she was young.I'm still sad that we just can't seem to connect like ""normals"""
593,"Hi Rosie,I agree with comments and insights from sanmagic and Candid.I would say that I have shared too much in the past with FOO in an attempt to try and make them understand me and to feel myself and the existence of all my problems validated, and at the same time I still felt that I was keeping way too much under my hat or I guess under the rug for my own safety and comfort. So that the last two times I've had face-to-face contact with more than one member of FOO I've had a complete meltdown after a few days. From one member of my FOO I have had significant support in the last few years but this support isn't really there when other members of FOO come into play. Like when supporting me would entail standing up to another family member. Nobody else in my family claims to have it (though I do have my suspicions re: my mother and one brother), however my mother claims their pet has it. Thank you very much. The poor little pet. What about your own adult child?? Too close to home obviously. Nothing against pets, I have some myself who are very dear to me and important. In bad phases i care for them better than for myself, but just the thought that I've mentioned my diagnosis and it's obvious that life is pretty difficult for me, but no acknowledgement of that, but just the pet...    I'd rather my mother hadn't mentioned this connection at all. But she can't help it. My only way to remain sane is to limit contact, which I'm doing, though probably not to the degree to which I will eventually have to do it. You have been courageous with your attempts with your family. Keep reading round here, I'm sure that will help you. And all the best to you as you continue your healing journey.   "
594,Hello there has anyone got any experience / knowledge on how we heal relationally - How do I get more friends / people in my life ? I don't even really know what the problem is in order to start healing it ? Is it not trusting people ? Being too perfectionist?Being too controlled ?Um I seem to think it's all of it with me ...Sometimes I feel desperate like I'll never get normal in this area I'll soon be working with a trauma therapist and really hope I can get helped in this area I so want more people in my life to share with ... 
595,"hey, bssr,i think sometimes making friends or getting new people into our lives is something that will just happen - a chance meeting, an urge to introduce yourself (or vice versa with the other person), serendipity or whatever you want to call it.  i do believe if you put yourself out to the world with a smile and a warm, inviting vibe, someone will respond eventually.  i also think that as your recovery continues, any roadblocks to this will be realized, explored, and resolved.  stuff like this usually just happens without having to put too much effort into it.  be your sweet self, sift through the responders so that you bring in other sweet selves, and the rest will work itself out.  you're ok, bssr, and you'll get better at this as time goes by.  keep the faith!  big hug."
596,"Hi Rose!I'm waiting for a trauma therapist too, and relationship (or lack of it) is high on my priorities for discussion.Quote from: Boatsetsailrose on March 04, 2017, 08:03:07 PMIs it not trusting people ? Being too perfectionist?Being too controlled ?For me it's the first one, which leads to the other two. Most of us know from bitter experience that we can't talk about the cause of our CPTSD; that most people will say dismissive or hurtful things. That means having what I call ""funny little ways"" and no explanation to offer.QuoteSometimes I feel desperate like I'll never get normal in this area I feel certain of that for myself, and sometimes I feel very sad about it, but over the course of six decades it's become easier and more natural for me to isolate myself. It's what you might call my comfort zone, although as you would know there's no comfort there. But at least when I'm depressed and weeping no one needs to know about it.I wish you luck with therapy. Let's hope it's someone who really understands and knows which way to go."
597,"Thank you Dear SAN magic, such a nice and comforting response "
598,"Hi candid, Yes the isolating thing, thing is and as you say no comfort - I can't let myself do it for long it just sends me down I'm finding physical exercise is helping shift my mind set - if I go for a jog in the morning or get out with the walking Grp "
599,"Does anyone have any good links, book recommendations, personal processes, exercises and/or experiences to learn assertiveness? "
600,I read a book on boundaries that was excellent.  Where you end and I begin.  Boundaries are really about being assertive and feeling the right to be.
601,"i've heard of mirror work helping some people.  face yourself in the mirror and tell yourself what you need to hear around being able to stand up for yourself, your worth, that you deserve to be heard, etc., whatever fits for you.  writing has always helped me as well, getting out the neg. beliefs and clarifying the pos. beliefs i want to replace those with.  just some thoughts.  i've also found that assertiveness takes practice, practice, and more practice until we get comfortable with it.  it's a process, like anything else.  best to you with this.  you deserve to stand tall and be acknowledged as the wonderful human being you are.  "
602,"Hi, People  I think it is great you are working on your assertiveness! I personally feel assertiveness and boundaries skills are like the cornerstones of happiness. I agree with sanmagic7 that it takes a lot of practice, and exercising them at first, can be really awkward, uncomfortable, or scary. But it's so worth it once they start to become your new normal.I like Boundaries by Cloud and Townsend. I really like their book The Mom Factor better, as the effects of different types of mother's had on their children was enlightening to me. They both have a Christian religious theme that some people might find off-putting (or attractive if your spiritual beliefs lean that way). But I feel they have a balanced view of situations. They are written with the assumption you are dealing with normal people rather than PD types.I also like that they mentioned not all people with boundary issues are just ""givers"" and how many people's depressions are actually reactions/signals to boundary violations/imbalances in their relationships. A lot of books ignore ""takers"" as having boundary issues. Once I started working on my assertiveness, I kind of learned the hard way that I could steamroll right over my less assertive friends if I wasn't careful. I've heard The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense is good but I've never read it. I also like the blog Captain Awkward. They even give scripts to letter writers on how to start difficult conversations. But they are politically pretty liberal and they don't allow armchair diagnosis. Hope it helps!"

604,"     I'm still having trouble forming cohesive thoughts, please forgive me if this incoherent. Your feelings matter, radical. You matter. Your T was not a good fit for you, at best, and possibly incompetent. If you have left her and still feel as you do, she was of no use to you. And that is what she was there to do - to help you. That is not your fault, and in fact I think you can give yourself a big congratulatory pat on the back that you now see her for what she is. I get it tho, how you feel ashamed and sorry for yourself but maybe that's the beginning of healthy, rational anger with her. Like a step in the grieving process or something. Whatever you are feeling, it's valid. Big hugs to you as you go thru this, examining your feelings and thought processes you've carried this far. "
605,"Quote from: radical on February 19, 2017, 05:10:45 AMA few people might recognise something.Yes, I do. As far as I know I was born 'wrong' and have remained wrong ever since. It's a hard trait to break. If people get angry with me or disagree with me I know I'm 'wrong' again. When people praise me I think ""they're just being kind"". Like you, I could cite plenty of times when other people used me then tossed me aside. I let pretty much anyone abuse me.I believe whoever said ""We teach other people how to treat us"", but that's a tough one for those of us whose primary caregivers taught us to treat ourselves so harshly. I hope you'll put the blame squarely where it belongs -- on this 'therapist' -- and do whatever it takes to be kinder to yourself."
606,"I've been coming back to this feeling forever as well. Reach out in hope, feel like I can finally trust someone or some thing, and tip the scales to the nefarious 'other'; the one who will fix my failure to heal myself, and...all that hope seems to drain one's energy instead, including the will to try again. Unfortunately this begins to morph into a belief that I'm no good, period; not just a passing feeling.First thing is to downgrade the 'worthless me' notion--it is, after all, just a concept, albeit a very strong one; and these are always changing, in flux. Even the world carries this illusion, as it sure looks like it's not spinning round, nor does it even look like it's circular--until one leaves it and looks back from space. The leaving involves lots of trial and error to reach that point, but it's doable. Maybe that's grasping at straws, but it indicates that not all  is as it seems. It's popular to say 'live in the now' when in fact it appears this precious moment isn't still, but more of a continuous movement. We can't really call it still, even; but we do, since language is, as Rumi once said, ""an imperfect tailor shop"".In part, I say that out of equal desperation to yours, as it hurts to read how you put yourself down. Hurts for you, for me, for this group. But it's brutally honest, too. It's so familiar...what's good about it? It isn't--as in this fear isn't good/bad or right/wrong. It's only part of the movement which we fight, and then get overwhelmed by its seeming power. Hope will build; its nature is to do so. You've also built powers of observation that have swung to the desperate side again. Easy for me to say. Why? Because it's where I've been so often, cried about endlessly, and wonder why I'd go there again. The only relief I've felt is when I can dampen the 'self' concept with meditation, or preferably with no technique other than acceptance that I have made it this far, and AM worthy of that small slice of joy, if nothing else;  even if that's just another comparison. We look for those, too, and forget to see the beauty in ourselves, which can be found in the movement, which we slow down and call now. We find our first step ahead that way; but need to slow way down to find it at all.The reason I bring beauty in is simple--your sharing here is a beautiful expression of hope beyond hope, past any category really. It's an expression of beauty behind the obvious pain from which it springs. I'd like to say it'll change, and it does--but rarely instantly and often not apparently, like the globe supposedly spinning when it doesn't seem that way.I once had a dream that involved backing a vehicle with poor traction, at night, over a long distance on a treacherous, isolated, snow-covered path with no visiblity. I was correcting a wrong turn to begin with, following someone's bad advice which had directed me to that dangerous point in the first place. Finding similarities in that vision to cptsd's journey doesn't require much imagination. Retracing the route--as in recovery--seems more dangerous than finding some other way. Impossible as it seems, it becomes the only way. I can't recall the dreams details as to how I did recover from that imminent danger, but I guess I did; and on my own, apparently. Courage, friend, to find that you're always at this point where the outside circumstance looks utterly hopeless. Maybe we need better words (I need fewer of them, LOL), but again, I return to the inner beauty that will guide you past these current troubles. Worthy? You're more than worthy. Thank you for being here. "
607,"Oh Radical, I missed your post and I'm sorry. Huge hugs to you. "
608,"Thank you MFTB, Candid and three Roses.Your support, and your hearing me matters so much.Woodsgnome, Your beautiful words brought tears.  You have such a depth of understanding and insight.  The gift to weave words so intricately... takes my breath away.  Thank you.Yesterday what I wrote about my T was just a fragment, but one I felt a burning need to express. As in this case, anger for me is often a brittle shell over hurt.  I feel grief for the people I've lost and i don't know what to do with it or where to put it.  I know the circumstances mean there can be no resolution, but I find it so hard to rebuild when I feel such sorrow.  We were trying to create something together, and there was so much work and improvisation and learning in the moments of needing to get done so many things we had little collective expertise in achieving.   I came to feel attachment and affection for many of those people, not from long heart-to-heart conversations, but from the slow process of people unfolding together.  It felt like I was ripped out.  Ironically, in part we were building a community and we expected to end up being neighbours and friends for the long haul.  Such a mad and dangerous dream.The person/offender/dangerously damaged individual involved, was part of another group that mattered to me, that I trusted, and when I tried to speak there about what happened it was awful, but what I'm left with most, is the magnitude of the loss of people I cared for.And now I'm losing the relationship with my therapist.One thing though, if anyone wonders where all the truly beautiful people are, they're right here on OOTS.  We may have been battered by them, but at least our storms have washed us up here."
609,"I missed this post, I make a point to try to reply to your post because I value you so much.  You have brought such insight and genuine caring that I want to return it in any way I can.  Always, when I feel hopeless you are there!  I feel you are moving forward, as difficult as it is.  I don't know exactly what is going on, but I do know that you are very intelligent and caring.  I often read your posts and think ""she is so smart.""  Be true to you, follow your heart and not the critic in your head."
610,"I don't post here very often - I think I posted here once! I find it very hard to talk properly about this stuff even though i'm quite a blunt and outspoken person.  I have talked flippantly about this stuff with a few people in person, but never deeper than scratching the surface; and even when I do talk a bit deeper about it I feel like it's not coming close to trying to describe everything. Anyway, I grew up with domestic abuse - my dad was physically and mentally abusive. We always assumed he had a mental health issue of his own, though he never really went to see anyone about it. I'm not sure why i'm more affected than my mother or my brother. My sister never had anything bad directed at her at all. I seemed to get the worst of it all. I'd always been anxious anyway, so it just made things much worse. That coupled with being friends with some of the wrong people made it much worse. When I was 16 I had a boyfriend who lived quite far away. He was terrible and emotionally abusive/emotionally blackmailed me a lot of the time. The only justification I had for staying with him is that I thought I loved him - but looking back at it now, I understand that I had a choice of staying at home and being physically and mentally abused, or going out and staying with that boyfriend and being treated somewhat normal (I thought it was normal but it wasn't.). I ended up getting pregnant and I had a miscarriage a couple of weeks after my 18th birthday. during this period I was basically being thrown out of the house and rejected by everyone I know. I grew up in a Christian household, so that made it worse because everyone pushed me away further in the church and at home. around this time I met my now fiancé, Alex and we have been together for nearly three years. he's about 7 years older than I am and he's very kind, supportive and loving. I had no choice but to continue living at home with my family because of financial situations - I kept losing jobs because of my mental health - and the abuse continued. it wasn't until about 7 months ago that Alex and I were able to find a place to rent and move out together because the situation had become too volatile at home. while some things have gotten better, many things have become worse. I've become very dependent on my fiancé, and he's so supportive I feel like he is the only person I really trust, and even then that's at a stretch! I struggle with coping and I am extremely isolated. it's at the point where I can't do anything unless there is someone with me, and so I get very frustrated because I can never do things when i'm ready to do them... I have to wait until he (or mum or whoever) is ready to meet me and do things. I end up having outbursts and i feel like i'm not in control. he isn't able to see his friends much because i struggle to cope. I can't explain it very well. At the moment he's probably the only person/thing that makes living with CPTSD slightly bearable and when he's gone, i struggle to cope without him. So i came up with a resolve for myself that if/when he does go out with his friends that i need to learn to cope on my own without him. unintentionally i push him away or i struggle to pretend to be happy when i'm really breaking down, but this always comes across as though i'm pushing him away or that i don't want him to see anyone else - which isn't true, i'm always trying to encourage him to meet up with his friends and that i don't want him to feel like he has to stay with me, i want him to have a life outside of my illness.  But it's hard now because i lock myself away from the world so that i don't hurt anyone. I honestly can't tell when i'm doing it because I've lived this way so long that it's become ingrained in me that this is the way people are - especially when these abusive attitudes have been inflicted upon me by more than one person. So i hide myself away because i don't want to hurt anyone, and i feel like i'm still ruining Alex's life because he's the one person i can't run away from. to be honest i don't even know if any of this is making any sense, but thanks in advance to anyone who manages to read this through to the end! i just feel very lost, because i'm feeling very tired and i don't mean fatigue tired. A lot of the time i feel as though i'm ready to go. i know it sounds over dramatic but i'm just waiting for life to end because i'm so tired of how relentless this pain/hurt is. "
611,"Esthergrace--I am so sorry for everything that you went through. I don't think you're being overdramatic at all. your pain and your hurts are valid. You are allowed to hurt. QuoteBut it's hard now because i lock myself away from the world so that i don't hurt anyone. I honestly can't tell when i'm doing it because I've lived this way so long that it's become ingrained in me that this is the way people are - especially when these abusive attitudes have been inflicted upon me by more than one person. So i hide myself away because i don't want to hurt anyone, and i feel like i'm still ruining Alex's life because he's the one person i can't run away from. That describes me exactly, and I know it is so hard. It's hard to finally trust safe others with our real emotions when all that's happened to us when we opened up before was invalidation and put-downs and worse. Isolation is so hard. I'm still struggling through it very slowly. Sometimes (and this sounds bad) I feel like we have to just let ourselves isolate, do what we need to do, and then reconnect when we are ready. I don't know if that's healthy or not, but that's how I deal with it.I'm so sorry again for how your dad and boyfriend hurt you. It wasn't right. You didn't deserve it  "
612,"esthergrace (beautiful name), i'm glad you posted.  i'm coming more and more to believe that part of c-ptsd's tragedy is what it does not only to us who suffer from it, but to those who care about us, who can't understand much as they'd like to, and who end up watching someone they care about suffer so badly.  i hate that part of it at least as much if not more.  my dear hub has been going thru this with me for 15 yrs., bless him.  it's been rocky at times, and i hate seeing him suffer in his confusion and inability to understand.i get what you're talking about when you say you don't go places without someone else.  been there, done that.  i used to be entirely independent, not relying on anyone for most anything (learned not to!) so to have that reversed on me because of this beast we call c-ptsd has been jolting at times.  i've learned more and more over the years how to live with it (even before i knew what it was), how to live with myself as i am now.  maybe, as joyful suggests, you just need this time to isolate and depend on him.  i'm thinking that as you go forward with your recovery, things will change.  your perspective and perceptions of yourself and others will change.  as you learn to trust yourself more, you will be able to trust being with others more.  are you seeing a therapist?  hopefully, that will help your process go a bit more quickly, a bit more smoothly.  plus the caring and support from the people on this forum.  that's helped me so much!it will take time, small steps, forward and sometimes back, but as long as you keep moving you'll get there.  i can relate to wanting it to be done with, too.  this stuff wears us down to our souls.  hang tough, esthergrace.  we're hangin' right beside you!"
613,"I'm really sorry you are in such pain, and glad you've joined us.You are making a lot of sense to me, what you are describing is a known outcome of extended experiences of abuse.I'm going to take a different tack and say that it can cause a self-perpetuating cycle and it can also be dangerous to rely on just one person for everything.  If you can find some help, and start learning to trust someone else, anyone else, to even a small degree, it might help.  Even a pet that requires walking, if necessary, someone else's pet could make a differenceI understand the feeling of being very afraid when I move outside of my comfort zone, and the problem that the main relief from increased pain that can accompany moving away from that comfort, being returning to safety.  What I've found is that I have to feel like * over quite a long period in order to start feeling comfortable in other situations.As much as I'm loathe to suggest it in some ways, medication might make being outside of your comfort zone more bearable.  It sounds like you are very depressed.  Two things which are also proven to make a difference with depression are; a healthy diet free of sugar and highly processed foods, and including vinegar, pro-biotic yoghurt and fermented foods. such as pickles, sauerkraut and kefir and secondly, regular aerobic exercise.  Maybe you could get started by joining an exercise class or going walking, running, cycling or horseback riding, with your partner.  If he was prepared to help get you started it would be great.Another thing that might help is psychotherapy, either one to one or in a safe group.You are really not alone with this.  It is so painful, but I do think that remaining within that safe space with one safe person could make the walls of your prison higher and thicker.  Any small step is important and valuable, and worthy of great self-congratulation.You've taken a big step in speaking here.  I know we will be happy to be a cheering squad for you, if you like us to be, and this site is also a great source of comfort and support.  Hope to see more of you around here!Cyber-hugs if you want them."
614,"@joyful @sanmagic @radical  Thank you so much for responding to this! It's really comforting having input from others who have gone through similar things. I find it hard because i go through periods of this so sometimes are better than others. maybe i'll have a couple of really good weeks, but the effort that i put in to having those good weeks drains me mentally and so i crash and get really bad again, resulting in really bad weeks instead of trying to keep it on a level. i agree with both opinions, that when i need the isolation i should take it and not worry about depending on my partner. i try my hardest not to depend on him too much because i do guilt trip myself about it a lot - i know it can be equally as isolating for him if i rely on him over long periods of time; however, he always tells me he wants to be there for me at the worst times because i literally have no one else that i can feel this way freely with, without having a lot of the symptoms denied or 'normalised' (all of my friends are at uni, or live too far away and can't drive here etc. and family sort of swept this under the rug so as not to have the abuse happening at home as severely again) .i agree with the healthy eating and exercise. a lot of foods i haven't been able to eat because i get severe IBS and Acid Reflux, but its taken me a long time to get all of my eating healthy for my body (as in i can't eat a lot of beans, legumes, onions, peppers, certain dairy products etc so it prevents me from trying new things, because if i have one thing that affects the IBS and Acid Reflux, then it affects my whole mental attitude. i try not to, but having a complete lack of control over my life for too many years has made me like a control freak down to every last detail of my small existence, so when i get ill i REALLY panic). I exercise about 5 days a week as well as trying to walk and do yoga daily, and i have been on SSRIs in the past but they didn't agree with me. I have 25mg of quetiapine, but i'm only small and even that dose seems to knock me out cold for at least a day or two, so when i have really bad times i take 1/4 to 1/2 a pill and it takes the edge off things, even if it means sleeping for half the week. i think thats the most tiresome thing.  I've missed out on a lot of things because i choose to do things that will be good for me so i can get better. i'll probably sound really jealous saying this, but I've always taken care of my health: i never drink or do drugs or smoke, and i work so hard at doing all the right things all the therapists etc have told me over the years, yet i barely get by; it angers me that there are people my age who completely trash their bodies and their lives, yet they are still able to travel and work and have kids. It angers me that i choose not to do these things when it would be so easy to just drink myself silly or get a drug addiction so i don't have to feel anymore. I'm constantly putting in the effort 100% of the time and I've sacrificed so much, including what people think of me - because most people don't understand. I kind of have to tell people that i can't show up because of anxiety, because delving into this stuff is too much for most people to handle, so they just switch off and think it's drama or something. (or they try to trivialise it ""everyone gets that every now and then"" ""we've ALL been abused, everyone has been abused"") My occupational therapist told me to set goals, like long term goals, medium term and short term goals, then break them down further into achievable steps; and I've been doing this, and I push myself daily because i know the direction I want to go in. But it frustrates me seeing friends and other people deciding to do these things on a whim, and achieving them in a matter of weeks because they have the money and the mental capacity to do that stuff. Whereas ive got my goals and then its like, to do that i need to have qualification 'X', to do that i need money, to have that i need to work, and to do THAT i need to be well enough - well enough meaning: being able to brush my teeth twice a day every day, to feed myself properly, shower, leave the house etc at BAD times as well as the good times. At the moment, that's not happening.. its got better, but when the bad times hit like the past week or so, it's been really hard. the one thing that keeps me going is hitting the gym and talking to my partner (strength training and gaining physical strength makes me feel less vulnerable.. it's something i used to do as a kid. i convinced myself that if i could run faster, or had more muscle then at least the violence side would be less painful or last for a shorter amount of time). anyway, sorry for the long message again! i feel like i'm ranting, but i wanted to divulge further on a few points that were brought up in your comments to give a better picture of what I've been doing. Thanks again for your replies, and sorry for the mish-mash of info and grammatical errors.

615,"Hi Esthergrace,I find it so frustrating when people assume I don't know things that I know very well and I'm not working on problems, when I'm working my arse off.  It wasn't clear to me where you were with knowledge and expereince of this horrible condition.  It sounds like you are pushing yourself very hard.  "
616,"it does sound like you're pushing yourself very hard - maybe too hard at times!  i've had to listen and learn not to overdo (and i'm not always very good at that yet) when i'm feeling pretty good because, like you, i tend to crash and burn, and am out of it for several days.  finding that balance can be difficult.  when i'm feeling pretty good, i want to do what i used to do, feel more 'normal'.  well. it seems that i have to keep re-learning that lesson!  maybe, soon i hope, i'll 'get it'.in the meantime, it's ok to take a break from all this.  you are unique in your needs right now, and it's ok to acknowledge, accept, and honor that (aah!).  go at the pace dictated by your body and brain, just like you do with your food.  (i have that ibs problem, too, and i've had to eliminate a lot of what i used to eat without thinking twice about it).  i've also written about tackling this that and the other quickly and hard and paying for it with exhaustion or illness.  either we have to slow ourselves down, or our bodies/brains will do it for us.best to you.  find a pace that suits you.  you're still moving, even if it's a little more slowly than you'd like.  we're here with you.  "
617,"I'm glad you mentioned that San, and put it really well.I hope you can be gentle with yourself, Esthergrace, and see being kind to yourself as being one of the most important kinds of 'work' we can do for ourselves in overcoming trauma.You are worth kindness  -from others and from yourself.  Also, rest and recreation, whatever little things can give you a break from endless struggle, they aren't an optional extras but human necessities"
618,"When I was at university I signed up for Human Development Across The Lifespan, a psychology subject. The text book was the first warning that it would be entirely focused on when things go right.  Four weeks into the semester I bailed out, unable to stomach any more about the interactions between mother and infant and how they bring about each completed developmental stage.  The enthusiastic lecturer, herself a mother, told us plenty of personal anecdotes about her children and encouraged other mothers in the lecture room to do the same. I sat there stewing and isolated in a space of empty chairs, alone again.It wasn't the first time I'd thought about the motherhood myth that says all mothers love their children. It persists despite the worst cases of abuse occasionally making headlines, when a child has actually been battered to death. If that's the case, the word 'love' has no meaning.In a tutorial where we were required to sit in pairs and answer certain questions, my 'buddy' patted my knee and said: ""I'm sure your mother loved you."" Afterwards I was furious. I should have said ""I didn't realise you'd met"", or, acidly, ""are you intending to be some kind of counsellor or social worker?"" Of course I said no such thing. Just went away with my stomach in knots, once again full of fury. Small wonder I isolate myself!The myth has withstood centuries of infanticide and we who aren't actually killed are still the hidden ones, shut down virtually every time we try to speak. It persists because it's what the majority want to believe, and it reaches a crescendo each year on Mother's Day.Mothering is the hardest job in the world, and I'm aware that many OOTS members are themselves in that role. But small wonder we approach each new therapist in fear of hearing we made too much of it, or we must have earned it, or all mothers have good days and bad days. Of course your mother loved you.I've been in pain all my life over my relationship with my mother. In that time I've told very few people ""my mother didn't love me"". But it's worse than that.  I can think up dozens of incidents that show she actively disliked (hated?) me and got a kick out of inflicting emotional pain. She didn't have 'bad days' where my siblings were concerned. She encouraged them to treat me the way she did. My father followed her lead; he was at work five days a week. Her word was law. Candid, the bad one. Candid, the troublemaker. Candid who can never do anything right, Candid the sullen teenager. Candid who's off with any boy who asked her out, and we can all guess what she's up to, can't we?Biggest regret? Most potent reason to beat myself over the head? It took me decades to wake up. I just wanted my mother to love me, and I didn't give up hope until a couple of years ago when the last of my siblings turned her back. I hadn't seen either of my parents for more than 20 years, and my dear old dad had died in the meantime. I knew I wouldn't be able to see him without her.So no one contacts me any more. I'm too much trouble, and I let the two cousins with whom I have occasional contact treat me accordingly. My husband pushes me to keep in touch with them and I have no interest in clearing my name.The Motherhood Myth is WRONG. Not all mothers love their children. All infants love their mothers -- it's that or die -- and in Human Development Across The Lifespan, that love changes and deepens from dependency to caring for the old girl in her declining years, a neat role reversal built on love.But who am I to be writing about love? I've never felt loved. I know my husband loves me but it's an intellectual knowing, not visceral. And tbh, I stay only because I have nowhere else to go.  I didn't pass the developmental stages and I function about as well as a three-year-old, not driving, not cooking, unable now to work, avoiding people... Oh, the shame of my whole life!"
619,"Quotemy 'buddy' patted my knee and said: ""I'm sure your mother loved you."" I'm sorry you had to go thru that. Those comments can leave us feeling like we've been kicked in the gut at the most private of moments, but in a room full of people all spouting the same text, I know I would have felt even more cut off, singular, odd. It may have taken us a while to ""wake up"" but we're awake now and that's all that matters. We can't change the past and we can't know the future, but we can actively seek health and stability here in the present. We can work for ourselves to build, layer upon layer, a new and brighter future for ourselves. Loving ourselves is the greatest gift we can give ourselves. The rest will fall in place, following that. "

I think I'm waiting for a miracle.Being able to drop the toxic shame and doing as you suggest above would certainly qualify as one.ParrotMyPain, your post was a bit cryptic, to me. Can you elaborate?"
621,"Oooh, yuk. And yes, my mother went to great lengths to suggest she wanted to 'help' me. Because I'm quite mad, you know. You might like this http://www.kellevision.com/kellevision/2009/05/the-scapegoat-as-truth-teller.html as validation."
622,"I also experienced my mother turning my siblings and extended family against me.  I was defenseless.  It cut me off from any avenues of family support.  I suppose, from her point of view, it was also a pre-emptive strike against anyone ever listening to me and posssibly critiquing her behaviour towards me.  It also shored-up her power in the family - scapegoating one member sends a powerful message about what could happen to anyone who doesn't tow the line.On the website 'Psych Central' there is a blog by an author called Peg Streep:  https://blogs.psychcentral.com/knotted/The same author has a different blog on 'Psychology Today:  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/tech-supportBoth are about unloving mothers and their unloved daughters."
623,"Hi Candid - Mother's Day was by far the absolute worst day of the year for me, not in terms of my own family, but my mother.  My mother did not love me and deep inside I knew that but was required to keep up the sham to remain a member of the family.  I hated it and it tore me up and eventually I could not hide the truth from myself.  My mother did not love me.  That was the hardest truth to admit, process and then let go of any hope of ever having the mother I needed and deserved.  I had held onto that wish for decades.  Personally I hope as Complex PTSD becomes better known that we can come out  more, that people will not say things like ""Your M must have loved you"" when we talk about our experiences.  Until then you can be both candid and Candid here  "

It also made me very reluctant to tell anyone what was going on for me. The fact that she pulled the wool over my father's eyes and convinced him I was bad was, I thought, the saddest thing... until my siblings dumped me.Thanks for those links. I will check them out.Quote from: Kizzie on February 10, 2017, 05:07:16 PMeventually I could not hide the truth from myself.  My mother did not love me.  That was the hardest truth to admit, process and then let go of any hope of ever having the mother I needed and deserved.  I had held onto that wish for decades.  The Motherhood Myth is as pervasive and enculturated as any religion. As helpless children, we figure if Mother is always right, we must be very wrong. I know I always believed I was deeply flawed but no one would tell me why. Relationship was hard for me as far back as I can remember, because I was hesitant to inflict myself on anyone. Alas, I still feel the same way... not because I was born flawed, but because I'm so damaged. I find it virtually impossible to engage in normal conversation, and hate meeting new people.QuotePersonally I hope as Complex PTSD becomes better known that we can come out  more, that people will not say things like ""Your M must have loved you"" when we talk about our experiences.  Until then you can be both candid and Candid here  Thanks, Kizzie.   When I meet this trauma therapist, I expect to ask early in the piece whether s/he has experience in treating clients who were emotionally abused as children. If the answer is no, at least I can do some educating before I run for the exit."
625,"***this is almost all TRIGGERS, considering the topic***Candid, your experience echoes my own; mine is to the point where I can't refer to either parent other than by the letters f and m...not 'mine'; I know, some will call this silly--'my' is just a 2-letter word, they'll say, but I feel better using the 1-letter reference. There is nothing but grief when the 'my' word is inserted; I literally can trigger big-time just saying it in the usual possessive way. The only claim to those 2 I wish to make is I got away. Sorry if that offends some, but it's how I survive, and I deserve that too.I never heard the love word via the m, either (or from the f either; he seemed, though, to care a wee bit more). But I did, unfortunately, encounter references to what was called love several times at religious schools I attended (my educational outcome was 'how to spot hypocrites'). Love was all over, in word, but never in deed. So, like you, I'm still unsure of what love is but feel I'm getting closer lately (inner critic says ""ya right, your'e just further away from the trauma years is all""). A good therapist has for sure helped me start to re-frame my entire life. Sigh--that's good, but it's also so tiring to have to do this. None of us ever asked for a full-time job just to recover from all this confusion and shame we carry into daily life long after.Regarding the school stuff, emotional abuse was the core, but sexual abuse from female teachers happened in grades K (first day), 3, & 4--in the 4th grade it caused a noticeable change in mood to where I couldn't even go to school unless literally dragged. The f pulled me out, and for a while I was in the care of a wonderful outside therapist to which the f took me (even though the school didn't 'believe' in that kind of thing). Still, all the parents liked was that I was declared 'normal'. I never could tell them the sexual abuses (partly as I didn't realize fully what was happening; no trust with them, but the T must have figured this out, and I was returned to the school demons. After, the overt sexual abuse stopped, but the emotional seemed rampant as always. To backtrack the m was an abuser from my first memory; and while her overt sexual abuse abated after the therapist meetings, just like the school people the emotional part escalated and ranged from overt to covert to abandonment. In some ways the abandonment was welcome; until I recall how lost I still was about the lack of this thing referred to as love or even affection. I won't mention later stuff with male teachers, given this thread's theme, and my bottoming-out mood in reciting this horrible litany.I tell of those times only to offer empathy for what you've felt, Candid--just writing about it requires some careful after-care. I wish you the best with your therapist experience. As mentioned, mine has allowed me to reach the edge of feeling human. I wonder what it must be like to feel wholly human, and loved. "

627,"Quote Now that I'm stronger, and clearer in what happened back then, whole-FOO abandonment pains me. I'd like a chance to tell them the way it is, but clearly they're not interested. It's such a bitter pill to swallow isn't it? We finally figure things out and are then faced with the hard truth that they will not ever hear/ acknowledge what we have to say.  I think that's why coming here is so helpful for me, I don't feel like I am alone with this huge loss any more, that others know what I feel and it does make a difference. "
628,"Ugh. Hugs, and condolances, to everyone on this thread. I am in the same boat - actively resented by my M growing up. Now she makes sweet but never acknowledges the past. Her birthday is near mother's day, meaning I feel anxious for most of every May."
629,"I don't know where to put this, having developed CPTSD as an adult, but also as someone who experienced childhood trauma.  So, this seems like the right spot.I wanted to quickly comment about contradictions.  I've been writing a lot about my problem with fawning and, in doing so, I've talked specifically about that and how it has impacted my relationships.  But I've felt really uncomfortable about the fact that focusing on one issue can create a false impression.  There are ways that I'm a mass of seeming contradictions.  I think most people are to some extent.What has bothered me in talking about fawning as a problem, is that there hasn't seemed to be a way of talking about it without oversimplifying my whole self, and I've felt like I've been in danger of doing myself an injustice in doing so, especially since when I first came here via OOTF it was because of bullying from a very nasty narcissist.  Also, In talking about the more recent problem, it might have sounded like I was (fawningly) taking excessive responsibility for that.  I just wanted to talk about my issue because what I need to identify and change in myself, is what is most important to me.  If I talked about the situation, and myself more broadly, it would show a more complicated and truer picture, but far too complicated for what I wanted to tease out and understand.But I've ended up feeling the need to clarify that the bullying that led me here was not caused by me in any way.  I'm sure my lack of confidence and some degree of fawning was one factor in why I was honed-in on, and I put my hand up for taking for too much, for too long, but not without some kinds of far-too-polite protest, even early on.  This wasn't someone I ever liked, she wasn't a friend.  I wasn't just worried about her behaviour towards me, but her affect on the whole group and the project we were involved in.  I was aware of her manipulativeness and dishonesty, and because she underestimated me, and we were thrown together (in part because she tried to turn me into her personal slave and whipping-boy) I was already watching her.  I talked to her directly, one to one, about my concerns in relation to one particular matter, and at the same time told her that I was not going to tolerate her behaviour towards me, and listed the behaviours.  I naively thought the problem between us was dealt with.  It was then that things turned really nasty.  I experienced things that I would have only expected to see on some TV drama, with an obviously devious machiavellianand twisted villain.Coming to understand her behaviour brought me out of the fog about other relationships, with people I actually cared for and this had huge repercussions.  It let me understand parts of myself too, problems of my own, that until then, I couldn't join up the dots on.  In the end, this has been what has been most valuable to me, being able to come here and find kindred friends, working on and supporting each other with similar problems.  Being able to understand, learn and change - which is painful and difficult, but so much lighter for having all of you and this haven.I loathe victim-blaming.  I didn't want to do that to myself, and I don't want to ever imply that anyone is responsible for abuse from others."
630,"Hugs? Hugs.  I can only speak for myself, but I know I am a swirling mess of contradictions, too.I have been bullied, and I have been the bully. I'm not proud of myself in either case.Being here has also let me understand myself so much more, and to start discerning the things I can work to change vs. the things I just need to accept.I always value the wisdom of your words. Thanks for sharing yourself here."
631,ditto what mftb said.  understanding behaviors of myself and others has helped me immensely.    we were taught contradictions - i think it's no wonder we carry them ourselves.  
632,"I've written a novel.  I've sent it to four people whose opinions I trust and who all have a bit of experience with writing.  I just got the feedback from one of the people, skimmed it, it looks like there are some helpful suggestions . . . and I am very, very nervous about reading it in depth.  This may be a combination of the C-PTSD and just normal nervousness about feedback dealing with something I've spent a lot of time and energy on and is sort of like my ""baby"".     It's easy for me to feel personally attacked when something I've done is criticized--even if the so-called ""criticism"" is, ""This part didn't work for me.""  Trying to separate criticism of ""what I've done"" from ""who I am"" is difficult at times.  "
633,"i'm also an author, and i hear you.  getting that feedback can be nerve-wracking.  you've written from your heart, soul, and gut, and those can be tender places to hear something construed as negative.  what has helped me is telling myself that this isn't about me as a person, these aren't personal attacks.  anytime we put ourselves out in the creative limelight, we run the risk of, hopefully, constructive criticism.  and, the more you can use it as 'constructive', a tool that will better enable you to construct your story in the best possible manner, the easier it will be for you to take it as a guide, something impersonal.   good luck with this, and kudos to you for putting yourself out there!  good going!!!"
634,"Good for you!I don't want to post a link, but a while back, I read a question sent to one of my favourite sites ""Captain Awkward"".  As it remember, it was very much like the question you've asked here about seeking feedback.  There was a lot of wisdom offered, both by the captain and by many  artists, writers and other creative people who contribute to the discussions.I don't have much experience of my own to offer, but I wish you well."
635,"Ever get tired of this?  I do all the time.  I try to talk about my feelings, and I get this push-back saying ""my minority is more disrespected than yours"".  Like, I wasn't comparing our problems, dude, I was just trying to talk about my feelings."
636,"Yes, this happens a lot. I inwardly react the same way you've stated.  they just don't get it.  "
637,"I think it is called the ""Oppression Olympics"".  It's a big problem having people feeling competitive instead of listening and supporting each other.  It's so frustrating, it just turns into another form of silencing (or trying to)."
638,Yes! I find this very irritating. Let's all get out out Intersecting Oppression (TM) slide rules and calculate who gets to silence whom.   This is the opposite of solidarity.

640,"Hubby and I stopped this because we were both there the day:Two friends were over, with wives. The men left the room, I and the ladies were talking. I was in the kitchen refreshing tea glasses when one began talking about all her diagnoses related to mental health. The other, HONESTLY said, 'That's tough. But, you know, I was just diagnosed with ... (an even scarier mental health condition)'. The two began comparing the symptoms, meds, etcetera. There were lots of exlamations of 'Yeah, well when I...' and 'That's not so bad if you consider when I...' For half an hour!My returning with their drinks didn't slow either down a bit. I was too stunned to stop them! They weren't talking as compatriots going through similar challenges, they were comparing to disparage the other!  I just smiled and said something like, 'Wow, ladies! I don't have a dog in that hunt, but both of you sound like you've got some hard challenges.' Of course, I was still in total denial about my childhood emotional abuse and I'd never been diagnosed with anything, so... Anyway, hubby and I talked about it later and said his initial response was more likely to be, 'What are you doing? Complaining or bragging?' We both burst out laughing - it was SUCH a great response! That seemed like the BEST response to me, whenever you state something you would like to discuss and anyone else answers with THEIR situation or condition. Hubby and I will use this if one wants to talk and the other tries the shut-down with THEIR situation. It works and can still make us laugh about that day.It's a good response and you are welcome to steal and modify it if you think it would help. Just, if anyone starts in with how THEIR situation is SO MUCH HARDER, WORSE, BIGGER, MORE IMPORTANT than yours - so, Are you complaining or bragging? "
641,"How about this one (and please take this as irony):Something along the lines of ""My workload is larger than yours and more important"" - from the guy who abused me to the point of my needing to go to hospital, thereby  putting me in a six-month work haiatus while I recovered and slowly caught up on my work  So silly. And yes, time is better spent supporting each other rather than competing with each other "

643,"I find this annoying, maybe even more so than what happens when I want to talk about how bad something feels and another person replies, ""Oh yes, that happens to all of us"". I never know then if she is trying to show solidarity or to diminish my experience. Possibly it's a sort of denial or protection from having to empathise with a greater pain. I see this as much like the 'mine's bigger than yours' response, but more insidious, the 'we're the same size so button up' response."
644,"On the flipside, sometimes when i've had conversations with different people and want to avoid the ""woe is me"" connotation by adding a ""but I can't really complain, there are people out there who have it much worse than I do"", I've been met with a pleasant and completely validating response:""There is no worse or better, just different"" Its nice to know that whatever the severity, some do recognise that you have the right to feel the pain that comes with negative events."
645,"Hey everyone,I'm back after a break. Life is sometimes a rollercoaster. I was feeling stable for a while then hit with a massive relapse. Needed to talk to some people who get me because it doesn't feel like people get me lately or care to. Does anyone else ever feel like people just don't understand that their words and actions can completely derail our peace and send us spiraling with symptoms? To make it worse, in my case I just finished getting scolded for being an annoyance while I could not control my anxiety. Sometimes I'd just like to hit some people upside the head with a book about what I am going through. I don't need scolding. I need understanding because nobody hates being like that more than me. Rant over."

647,"I don't know where to post this, so I'm going here.  I love this forum.  I believe that it takes people to post and people to respond.  I try to respond as much as I can to other people, it is important.  Right now, I am not able to do that.  I have a lot going on and I just can't seem to give the support that I want to.  I can't even read a lot of the posts because it is too triggering.  So I want everyone know that I am lurking and I care.  When I get things taken care of I hope to be as active as I once was.  I support you all even if I am not posting replies.  I feel bad, but I think you all can understand."
648,"I too have felt like that many times, but I think that we all participate as we are able, and we all probably have times when it is difficult for us to be as supportive as we would like. I'm glad that you are here, Dee, regardless of how much you are able to post. "
649,"Hi Dee, I'm just really glad you are around!It would be overwhelming  (and probably self-destructive) to feel responsible for hearing and responding to all the distress and pain here.  It can be overwhelming at times to read or to respond to any at all.  I know it is for me.  Sometimes we need to be cared for, or to be apart to care for ourselves and that is more than okay, it's healthy.We do what we can according to our own needs limits and that's enough.  I like being able to trust the community as a whole to be listening and responding.  Just feeling ""responsible"" is enough for me to take a step back and a take a reality check.I'm glad you are doing what you need to do and I'm always glad you're here, whatever place you're at."
650,Happy to hear you're taking care of yourself!  That's a good thing! 
651,"Dee, you said what I wasn't able. I feel bad about it, so push myself - maybe harder than I should. Take your time, do your thing. We'll still be here - maybe lurking also - and at least someone will be here to help (thank you moderators!) others in our absence and us when we're ready again.Please take care of yourself, Dee. We will be thinking of you while you're post-free. "
652,"dee, i've felt like this more than once.  i think it comes with the territory.  there has been so much pain, too much suffering.  some days i can't deal with anyone else at all.  i'm glad you're doing what you need to do for you.  atta girl!  big hug, dee."
653,"This may be a 'well duh' post since I'm frequently feeling these days, why didn't I see that before.  I have always felt that no one in my family cares about me, how I'm feeling and what's important to me. I'm there for them but when I need someone there for me I am alone.  No matter how much I do for them.  I'm at the point where I have given up and don't jump to help them like I did. I have to distance myself a bit, because I naturally want to help them, to the point that it is taken for granted and unappreciated.What I realize recently, is when I talk about my feelings on a subject important to me they listen with a defensive stance and make it about them.  Even when it has nothing to do with them.  Since learning about my cptsd, my adult daughter even said ""if you ever want to talk...about anything...I am here for you"".  But when I brought up a subject bothering me greatly she made it all about her and did not care to listen to how or why I was bothered.   She was rude and hurtful.  I realized because she is my child she will always be listening to me as if it is about her.  But I also noticed my husband did the same, listening to me and making it about him in a very defensive way.  Thus the feeling, no one cares about my feelings or cares about me.  I'm now recognizing it and thinking it's a maturity problem (theirs) which also comes across as lack of empathy, at least where I am concerned. It didn't help that I had little self esteem and questioned myself.  Trying to share my feelings usually turned into argument, so it must be something I am doing.   Now I recognize the defensiveness when it happens and point out that what I'm saying is about me and not them.  It has helped me."
654,"mature, empathetic communication is a learned skill, not always known by individuals.  that you can now recognize the defensiveness and divert it, max, is a skill in itself.  i'm glad it's making conversations smoother for you.  probably for the others, too.   well done!"
655,"Thank you Sanmagic!  I feel good when a light turns on in my head, especially lately realizing 'hey, it's NOT all me' as I was usually left feeling.  I just wish I had learned it years ago, as I could have avoided being pushed down many rabbit holes.  "
656,"Max, my family does this too. ALL THE TIME. I've honestly given up telling them anything that is important to me because it is either completely belittled or made about them, like you said. It is so frustrating. We need support and it's so hard when the people closest to us seem incapable of giving it!! That, I think, is why I love this forum so much. People who don't even know me are more supportive than the people who are *supposed* to be the most supportive...It's not easy... "
657,Agreed
658,"I have been finding with my recovery that when I make a positive step forward, an old habit or attitude comes back as opposed to a new skill being learned.In the context of the recent bullying I have been ecperiencing, I do get a annoyed and frustrated when I am told things that I already know, or am spoken down to like I have no concept of social relations too; ie I cannot control what other people think or do (umm... duh), I'm seeing things that aren't happening (observing odd behaviour from people and being confused/distressed by it is not seeing things that aren't happening)Having my past, long, respected, successful people management/oriented career completely discounted as experience for behavioural observation and knowledge is also tremendously upsetting.How have you guys fared?"
659,"well, contessa, i also find that i can't stand when people speak generic platitudes to me after i've said something personal.  for example, if i've said 'i don't like what's happening in the world' and someone responds 'well, we just have to do the best we can with what we have', it drives me nuts! my hub and i have been getting into this, especially lately.  he comes from a 12-step background, where these types of sayings are thrown out all the time.  but, to me, it seems that there must be some independent thinking occurring, that people need to 'own' what they say rather than simply repeat what they've read or heard.  i don't know if this is a remembering on my part, but i've never been too much of a fan of this kind of communication.  back in the 60's, there were a lot of hippie stuff that came off the same way, so i've been hearing this for many, many years.  the same with any 'trendy' thing, some religions, and other situations where there doesn't seem to be much independent thinking.to be annoyed by this - is that a bad thing?  something i need to change about myself?  personally, i most enjoy conversations with people who are free thinkers, who have their own ideas,  and who can take info from what they've learned and make it their own.contessa, i don't blame you for being upset by this stuff, including your work/life experience being discounted.  to my mind,  it shows respect for yourself, what you've been through, your intelligence and information-gathering skills.  i guess i'm failing to see the problem here."
660,"I'm sorry you are experiencing this too.Two things for me: one is that I'm more uptight about being patronised and talked down to.  It has always happened, but I'm less ""relaxed"" about it just now.  This is because of my own experience of bullying and those who assume that I'm crazy (or whatever euphemism the prefer to use) and that either a) it wasn't that bad, but I was oversensitive due to my ""issues"" - (soft version) or, b) I imagined the abuse and vicitmised and traumatised a saintly woman in speaking out about it.   It would be less damaging if they assumed I lied to hurt her, but that wouldn't be a nice thought.  Much nicer to patronise me to death and talk to me like I have acquired a severe intellectual disability.  So there's that.But I'm also aware that many people regress to bad cliches when they don't know what to say or how to help, in all kinds of situations.  I don't know what is so hard about just saying ""I don't know what to say"" or ""I haven't experienced this but it must be horrible"".  A sub-version is what I call 'vitamin K syndrome'.  People seem to have a need to 'solve' serious problems that they know nothing about and can be incredibly patronising in doing so.  eg,  I've been terribly ill with X, I haven't been able to work or socialise for three months and it is hard getting through the day with the pain and nausea  Answer: Have you tried vitamin K?, I find it works wonders with my Z (where Z is a minor and unrelated condition like dandruff.)   Also the many smug sufferers of the 'just world fallacy' need to minimise real harm or believe that if something has gone terribly wrong, it must be because of something you have done, or not done to bring it on yourself, so that they can continue to imagine the world is safe and what happens in our lives is always under our control. You are a very smart and competent, Contessa.  Don't let others undermine your confidence - hold onto your truth however you can.  Lately, I've found in some situations it is good to come back to it later when I've had time to think, whether by addressing what was said, or by reaffirming my own experience in a non-defensive way.  Not in every instance but where the instance and the person is important."
661,"Thank you to both of you, these responses are varied but both valuable. I suppose I rambled a bit, writing a post before getting started with my day! And plus on my clunky phone. I'll see if I can fix up my ramble here, but it does not make your responses SanM and Radical any less relevant.From living in a world of ""the worst case scenario"" for several years, I absolutely love now that I do not feel immediate annoyance or anger when something happens. I can respond to a situation, whether good or bad, with calm and respect. These are not new behaviours of mine in the least, the values and attitudes I lived by are making a comeback. The professionals say that these are god things to learn, but i'm not learning these skill/behaviours/attitudes. I'm remembering them. The anger and emotion have settled down to a point where logic is making a comeback too, and i'm loving it! This is a positive in my recovery.With the bullying now, I am being told that I have automatically applied the ""worst case scenario"" to the situation which may not in effect be happening at all. That, yes, can be a real danger. I've been told that maybe I've assumed the worst, treated it at such, and in essence am actually causing the negativity in the first place. This is a negative.I was confronted by my doc before Christmas that left me in tears. Now that I am not so anxious and upset, I can express the same things as I always have with calm, and yes without being on the defensive as a confrontation often brings. A few days ago I let her know that her confrontation upset me more than what is actually happening. She reiterated that, say for example, for someone to stop talking to me, maybe I in effect stopped talking to them first because I thought they weren't talking to me, hence they stopped talking to me as a result. My response was clear, ""No. They stopped talking to me."" For someone to talk to me with a pained look on their face with gritted teeth... yes maybe they had a bad day on one day. Things usually return to normal the next day. For several people to have barely a conversation with me, through gritted teeth or with pained looks on their faces, to me and only me, and immediately speak happily and freely with everyone else, consistently for five months now is not one person just having a bad day.So yeah. That is what is annoying me because i've now turned into the problem. I know i'm not perfect and have not handled this situation with the normal finesse, but, I did not cause this problem. I've also had enough experience with people to know how to observe behaviours, and see the patterns.Now i'm rambling again. Thanks for the vote of confidence! Onward and upward.So I guess in this sense, yes, there is not problem with my intelligence here. "
662,I am a new poster and as I have read through these messages I have been surprised at the amount of aha moments.... I have felt alone and like I dont fit in my whole life. I had a very tough and sad upbringing where I didnt really connect with anyone healthily. As a result I have struggled through my adult life especially connecting with others. I am a recovering people pleaser/ caretaker and I dont have any close relationships at the moment. Im just sick of feeling resentful and taken advantage of... For which I know I am partly responsible for because I give too much. Its just so hard today and I just wonder is all this effort to connect with others even worth it? I have this human need to connect with others that I just dont feel capable of doing  
663,"Welcome, Cc!  QuoteI have this human need to connect with others that I just dont feel capable of doingI relate to this big time. "
664,Thanks mourning dove. Its nice to hear I am not alone in that thought. 😀
665,"Welcome, cc! Good to have you here. I know I need connecting with others but I just don't have the energy it takes. I'm just giving myself permission to feel what I feel right now. "
666,"Hi three roses  I think your stance demonstrates good self care, it is certainly better to just give ourselves permission to feel what we feel.  I can be so hard on myself at times, mostly compassionate but I have this urge to have myself 'fixed' which I know is not helpful or caring to myself but after years of working hard to improve myself it is how I feel somedays especially when Im exhausted. "
667,"Quote from: Cc on July 23, 2016, 03:00:08 PMIts just so hard today and I just wonder is all this effort to connect with others even worth it? I have this human need to connect with others that I just dont feel capable of doing  I feel you. I think it's worth it. It takes time. Baby steps. I try to think ""good enough is good enough"" with each interaction I have with people. Sending you big Love.  I imagine that you probably are capable, but that it just needs to feel okay first, which is totally healthy. You can slowly acclimate to socializing with people if you'd like to, ease yourself into it in your own timing. And if you are ever too overwhelmed, then it's okay to be where you're at too. We have to remember that our sensitivities and responses are normal ways of dealing with abnormal situations. Keep showing yourself compassion. Honor yourself, it's okay. I try to remind myself that Shame is a social emotion. And the brain is a social organ. I believe our wounds lie in the realm of being social, and that eventually, so will our healing. In the meantime, thank you for sharing here and being real. Respect & Love to you!"
668,Hi cc Thank you for posting. I really relate to what you are feeling and experiencing. I can see I have made progress with the people pleasing / care taking and we all here have made progress in all areas on some level it is just that as you say when tired or overwhelmed or just plain fed upIt is harder to see and get dispondent. I am currently spending time with a friend ( who also has cptsd) and it's interesting as I am picking up on her emotionally difficult times and also because she is the 'unsure needy type ' and I am the 'don't worry I'll help you type ' I am seeing my self more clearly It is good because we talk about it but it is draining too For me this codependency stuff is hard to get at as it can be sneaky I have found the coda fellowship helpful (coda 12 step programme ) see on line for meeting in your area and also melody Beaty ( author on the subjects we are talking about and she writes how to practice ways to heal further It's def a work in progress for me and sometimes i can relapse but as you say compassion for self and the little one inside is important We had yrs of thinking about others hey 
669, sweetfreedom & boatsetsailThank you for your replies and kind words of encouragement.  I have been just finding my feet with navigating replies on here! Whats so good about this forum is I can actually can see how much progress I have made with the issue of connecting since posting this initial comment. Its amazing how much healing can be done when you focus on yourself and loving and caring for yourself. 
670,"Hello, new member here    20 years suffering, thinking it's all about just being strong and talking yourself out of all the pain ... only to learn very recently that no matter how strong, I need help. So lot's of healing to do but this post struck close to me ... about the people pleasing and being a caretaker. I have struggled with this big time and only now am realizing it is a side effect of Complex-PTSD. I give so much love and worry so much about making other people happy, go out of my way to do it, become a doormat for them to walk all over just to see them happy ... but it leaves me so lonely, sad, and depressed. I can't understand it or make sense of it. Why do I do it? Why can't I stop putting myself out there when I see someone does not care or appreciate? I am lucky to have some very good friends who do reciprocate my love but they are all my girlfriends. I have not dated much but the few men I have liked, it has been this relationship of where I right away commit all my love and energy to them even when they obviously do not care to reciprocate, only take. They take and take and I give and give .... I don't understand why I can't stop myself? I wonder is it lack of self-love?"
671,"I can relate to this and I know it is difficulty setting boundaries.  It is hard for me to say no and even harder to say no and not feel horrible, either bad I did or feeling I lost someone.  Difficulty setting boundaries is common with CPTSD.  I also know that it was something I did to survive.  The problem is, like so many other things I do, it is no longer helpful or necessary.I have to work on it one day at a time.  The first thing I learned is to think about it, and if the person pushes for an answer it is always no.  I can go back and change a no.  I love that I know longer feel I have to return text messages from my ex-husband.  I actually enjoyed it when he sent a text asking if I was ignoring him.  I use to panic at his texts.  I still don't have connections to others really (one good friend across the country) but I am taking steps.  This site is teaching me about connections, healthy relationships, and what friends really are. "
672,"I can relate to this too.  Welcome dees. I am new too.  Your post has similarities to my life.  I have found lots of good info here and counseling has helped.  Pete Walker's book, Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving, also helped me.  I can only speak to my personal experience and having done lots of reflection  I have concluded a main issue for me is that I have never felt loved.   I tried to be there for everyone else I now believe from wanting to be loved.  Trying to earn it. At the time I thought i did it only because I loved them, but I had no limits to protect myself from being used.  It comes from a very primitive wound that I don't believe can ever be healed. Each hurt after by people I love is a direct shot to that core wound.  In doing for everyone else I neglected me and did not love myself.  I was internalizing everything, starting in childhood, believing something is wrong with me.  That  I was damaged, unworthy and unlovable.  Yes, for me it included a lack of self love.   It has taken an awakening to why I feel that way and especially an understanding that the behaviors of others was about them, their own issues and not me.  It has been very freeing to understand but I struggle with the sadness and stay pretty isolated.  I know the feeling of wanting to be alone.    I am though trying to take better care of me.  To love myself.  I don't know if this helps but I hope things get better for you soon.  "
673,"Welcome, Dees! Thanks for joining. "
674,"Hey Cc. QuoteI have been surprised at the amount of aha moments.... I have felt alone and like I dont fit in my whole life.Oh yes, can relate.I am sorry you have difficulty connecting to others. I have read from Pete Walker that interpersonal relationships are especially hard and is where most of our triggers lie because we were hurt in our first experiences of interpersonal relationships.Most likely, you were forced into the roll of pleasing others and taking care of others needs earlier in your life, that your own were not forfilled- sense feeling resentful. If you are giving too much to others in your life now, i just want you to know that its not your fault. People are taught certain ways to be, and maybe you were taught this.AND no matter how you are- no matter if you are giving too much than you are getting back-that does not give anyone reason to mistreat you- it doesnt make it *ok*.I wonder too if people are worth connecting too.  Thought that people are all just the same, that they will let me down also.but then i try to hold onto the hope that, I am attracting what happened to me, through other people and am attracting other who share the same view i have of myself. - who treat me the way i think i expect i should be treated.I know i have my own wounds to work through, therefore my own wounds slot into the other persons like a jigsaw piece- and thats not my fault.I understand totally what you are saying about your doubts with others .You have every right to doubt as you may have bene hurt. You have every right to distrust.it is a lot to try to connect when you have been hurt / used etc. in relationships. I would say, if you are able to, to remember that and to be patient and gentle with yourself. In time, with healing, it will come.  "
675,"CC- Count me among those who share your experience. There are a lot of us!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's especially hard to reach out your hand to connect with others after it's been slapped a few times. My few attempts at forging adult friendships resulted in me being taken advantage of emotionally and financially. One ""friend"" even moved out of state without telling me!"
676," Hi, I'm new to the forum as well and can also relate to many of the emotions and experiences being shared here. I've a Wife and 2 kids and still struggle with lonliness, feeling understood and overwhelming fear at times. It's great too see that there are so many good compasionate people on here that can relate and are supportive. Many wishes of peace and  love for everyone here. And also thanks for having the courage to share with others.... such is not easy.  "
677,"Just wondered if others experience this?I seem to have a sixth sense for people who are dangerous or manipulative. Its like I meet them and there's that ""tense violins in movies when the bad guy comes in"" sound goes off in my head, its kind of paralysing, like a freeze effect. I've lost count of the amount of times now where I know immediately there is something wrong with a person, but when I tell others all they see is the charm, the confidence. This person is often a leader, a manager, a new addition to a group of friends or perhaps a boyfriend or girlfriend. When you voice your concern, friends or colleagues tell you that you are being paranoid or stupid. The last time it happened was a manager at work, who everyone thought was awesome, but turned out to be both lazy, manipulative and a fraud. I knew it immediately, but it took a year and half, and a number of destroyed client contracts and the steady breaking of trust with more and more people, before others would see it. Again, I was told I was paranoid when I said it.You have to sit back and watch them begin to erode things around your friends, family or work colleagues and 6 months to a year later, they all start saying what a snake in the grass this person is. Is this something common in CPTSD or similar conditions? Cheers for readingBiscuits"

680,"Yes!When you're their prey you get good at spotting them and as you say, it is like having a sixth sense."
681,"Not directly related to C-PTSD, but still something that I have to put up with..I was on a plane recently.  A flight attendant didn't want to serve me my drink and cookie.   Out of the whole plane, he planned to ""overlook"" me.  I can only surmise that he did so because in his eyes I was non-gender conforming.  My hair was off... it's was early... so I suppose I looked more non-gender conforming than usual.  So... I know he probably hates himself, and took it out on me.  But that doesn't make me feel better.  He was just making an example of me, out of the whole plane, that I was not person, and therefore didn't need a cookie.  It's sticks with you... your anger at being treated as not a person."
682,"This is so sad.  I wish I could give you a drink and cookie. Heck, I'd give you an extra cookie for being gender-nonconforming (not that you are asking for anything extra)."
683,"what a rotten man! you didn't deserve that at all. I know the feeling of being treated less than human because of identity.. it hurts, but you are definitely a person and the anger you feel for not being treated as you should is absolutely valid!! big hugs if you'd like "
684,Thank you Mourningdove and Tea-the-artist.  I'll take your hugs and your extra cookie!    
685,Poor little bigoted man. I'm sorry you experienced this. It says nothing about you and everything about him. 
686,"Ditto to everything everyone has said.  I have never been treated in that manner, but as a beginning teacher I had th department chairwoman come after me because,""students are saying one of the scienc  teachers is a lesbian, and I know it is you.""  She deemed me ""inappropriate"" - like my whole being was by its very nature flawed.  Grrr.Hang in there.  You are beyond worthy."

688,"but you did talk about it this time, so that tells me that you are finding more worth in yourself.  yay!  to be ignored like that is disgusting, in my eyes.  how dare he treat you like you don't exist!  or to be singled out as 'inappropriate' like that chairwoman.  what the ding dong is going on with people that diversity isn't celebrated as something that makes us interesting instead of monochromatic!  grrrr, indeed!"

699,Hello Just sharing where I am at with the 'feeling lonely' experience ..I've never been one for having a lot of people in my life and sometimes I feel an odd ball for it .. then I remember where I came from and say 'it's ok I'm doing ok and I am growing ...Not having a partner at the moment and winter being here seems to be triggering the aloneness .. but I know that building friendships is important in this interim period as I don't want to go into my next relationship and be all or nothing about it .. expecting that one person to fill me up to the exclusion of a wider circle ...Trust and intimacy are my issues in connecting with others I know this and also my own relationship with myself and my self confidence / self assurance.. but I am growing and I am trying and whilst I'm not where I 'want' to be with it all I am here working with what I have I don't have many friends and I don't have anyone 'close ' in my life sometimes I think it's a big ask for others to forfill the missing family thing ... I crave the 'family feeling - living as part of a circle ... even though my foo were / are disfunctional I still look back with fond memories and feelings ... no one does it like family / having a partner does ... now I'm in my 40's friendships arnt as time connected as they were in my 20's the days of 'best friend have left me somewhat ... 
700,I did some meditation today and was shown I am now on a path of the heart ... if anyone has any thoughts on this I'd appreciate .. it feels like I need to connect with myself somehow through my heart ... but I don't know how ? Does this make any sense ?? 
701,"Maybe what you were shown has something to do with the heart chakra?There's a link to a test on this page, as well as some info on the different chakras.https://www.eclecticenergies.com/chakras/introduction.php"
702,Thank you dear three roses ... wow it's really good and I got to see that my base chakras are where I can work on ( I knew this but now I have a clearer foundation to work on them Many thanks  The questionnaire also helped me to see what I am good at  very good 
703,  
704,"Boatsetsailrose, you said: ""...whilst I'm not where I 'want' to be with it all I am here working with what I have."" That's all you need to realize, I feel; a pretty good achievement all on its own. It doesn't have lights flashing or anything grand announcing you've made it to that elusive somewhere. I'm pretty much traveling the same route...all the grandiose plans I might have once had per friends and relationships especially are pretty much over the cliff. But I'm still here, still think I'm an okay person (if hurting), and I haven't given up; just don't have a clear picture of how or where I'm headed, and don't know if that's really what it's cracked up to be anyway. My take on the infamous 'other' (person, thing, event, object, etc.) is that yes, there certainly are those I'd like to know and share with--lots of them, and maybe even a special one; but as a complete and interesting enough person all on my own, too. I'm not out to impress any 'other', but to learn and share with them as complete beings (including what we call 'flaws' or 'faults').Today I ran into this little prose-poem that speaks to this: You don't have to be the best.You don't have to win.You only have to rememberthis intimacy withthe sky, the nearness of themountains and feel the warmthof the sun on your faceand know that you are alive,and that you are a success,and victorious,without having to provea damnthing. - by Jeff Foster----------------------------------------------------------""...here with what I have"" is how you put it, Boatsetsailrose; and what you have is a loving heart...complete and already in place. Thanks for sharing a bit of it here.  "
705,Thank you woods gnome ... so good  Love Jeff foster ... spent a wk end with him in his earlier retreat / meeting days ( I think I've said to u b4) Now he is mostly over seas and so I catch him on face book
706,Urr felt lonely today ... off to a meeting now to connect ..I have been ill so spent much of the week on my own.. so easily can get into self hatred and today I felt really sad 'I wish I was important to someone' and then this little voice inside said 'you are important to me ' it was very comforting Today and for many months now I didn't use an addiction ... i can see clearly how my patterns go and what I used to use addictions on
707,   i'm so glad that little voice spoke up 
708,Struggling with this also.  First Christmas since separated - alone for first time in ten years. I've been working on the chakras.  Heart and solar plexus for me! 
709,Thank u three roses xPs I don't seem to have the little jumping icons anymore  
710,Hi manchesterford Yes the 1st Christmas will have its feelings hey ... all that love can go inwards now and learning to be more self compassionate xKind to self Thank u for the chakra reminder - I would like to do some work on my bases 
711,"So, i struggle a lot with feeling like the happiness, comfort and well-being of everyone that i'm in contact with. (i doubt i'm the only one...) My question is how much AM i responsible? i tend to see everything as my fault, or as my job to fix and then feel guilty about it all.Does anyone have any insights about where to draw the line? How much to support the people that we know, and when to let go and let them work out their own stuff?Thanks "
712,"somewhere along the line i heard these guidelines about responsibility toward others (or i made them up - can't remember anymore!) :we are responsible for children, for helping them find a way, for guiding them through advice or role modeling, for teaching them what they need to know in order to become responsible adults, for allowing them to make mistakes and helping them learn from them, to provide boundaries, and to protect them.we are not responsible for other adults.  we are not responsible for their choices, nor their feelings.  we are not responsible for living up to their expectations.  we are not responsible for fixing either them or their situations.  we are not responsible for their mistakes nor for teaching them.  our responsibility begins and ends with ourselves.  we keep ourselves safe through boundary-setting, and do what makes us happy.  others may not agree with either of those options for ourselves, but we are not responsible for their happiness or comfort level regarding our own choices.if we are asked for an opinion, for help, for guidance, we may, if we choose, provide such things.  if we have an opinion, help, or advice, we may ask if they want to hear how we feel or think - but only if we have the time and/or energy to be involved.  we have no obligation to be involved.  our involvement with another adult is by our own choice.  certainly, there are separate instances when someone is distressed or in trouble/danger when we may want to step in and take some kind of action in a 'good samaritan' kind of way, but those are always our own choices.  these are ideal guidelines, but basically, as adults, we are responsible for ourselves first and foremost, and we allow other adults to have the same responsibility for their own lives.  people learn by making mistakes, not by doing everything correctly, and i believe part of our responsibility to other adults is to allow them the opportunity to learn for themselves.  it gives us a sense of self-worth, pride, and accomplishment to do so, and we grow from it.  to continually take that opportunity away from others does them a disservice and can create co-dependence.i've learned about this the hard way.  breaking negative and/or abusive cycles meant that i had to go my own way regardless of how or what others thought.  there were a lot of angry people in my life, but i learned that the only person i can truly make happy is myself.  even recently people have gotten angry at me because i stood up for myself or made a choice they didn't like.  i had no intent to anger them, to hurt them, but only to take care of myself.  they have a right to their feelings, but those are not my responsibility, and i don't have to try to smooth things or fix things for them.  they can work that out on their own.   my opinions only.   "
713,I like this response very much Sanmagic. Very inspirational. I think I need to sit down and think about who I am and am not responsible for too. 
714,"Totally agree with Sanmagic, in my counselling I am learning that things that happened and made me this way aren't my fault, very easy to self blame when we can't find the answers we are looking for. I find journaling - writing down my thoughts on one page then on the next page I write down why I think things happened and most of the time I do find answers and they aren't answers that blame 'me'. When I write I find all my feelings even things I wasn't aware I was actually feeling come out on to the paper, this gives me time to reflect and try and make sense of it all, in my counselling I have been asked to write letters to the people that abused me, not give them to them but write them as if I were, each couple of days you need to re write the letters to people and you find the blame and anger does get less and less, I was very sceptical about doing this but was very surprised at the outcome and how it made me feel, I don't read the letters out to my counsellor, just explain my thoughts and feelings about them and find that this really helps me, not saying it would work for everyone, but blame plays a huge part in my life and by doing this helps me to feel better about myself."
715,"hey, eyessoblue, i've done much the same thing, and it's helped me, too.  writing these things out often brings clarity and realizations of a much more positive nature than when i keep them swirling around inside my head."
716,"P. 80 in ""CPTSD: From Surviving To Thriving"" -""Perhaps the greatest reward of improved emotional intelligence is seen in a greater capacity for deeper intimacy. Emotional intelligence is a foundational ingredient of relational intelligence - the type of intelligence that is also frequently diminished in the general populace.    ""As stated earlier, intimacy is greatly enhanced when two people dialogue about all aspects of their experience. This is especially true when they transcend taboos against emotional communication. Feelings of love, appreciation and gratitude are naturally enhanced when we reciprocally show our full selves - confident or afraid, loving or alienated, proud or embarrassed. What an incredible achievement it is when any two of us create such an authentic and supportive relationship!""I expect from time to time that I will bother, anger, please, comfort, irritate, enlighten, or challenge each of you. I give my full permission now for each of you to respond to me, ask me for clarification, tell me I'm wrong, or challenge me in turn - in doing so we build our intimacy and capacity for mutual support. We're all just people. "
717,ditto.
718,Man I agree there was a time when I didn't care about having loving relationships in my life but not so now.  I'm kinda in the middle of a breakup now with some one who can't or possibly is unable to have an open communication in the relationship and it is really painful and sad. I wrote about it in another place on the site but haven't heard back from anyone. It's so hard to build these relationship with people but it's even harder letting the ones that u have really tried at go. Ah I'm in pain right now really regretting putting my heart into this thing it was clumsy of me lol 
719,"Hello tyy,Sorry for your pain and sadness. Not sure putting your heart into the relationship was a mistake or clumsy although after we do these things it sure feels like it. I'm just beginning to understand that my last (now ended) relationship started well because I did most of the listening and travelling. Sadly, when I needed support, ""I was pouring my heart out"". Can't speak for you though I know if I can't have open communication then I'm right back where I was as  a child. Unseen and unheard and I'm not going back there. You are entitled to be seen and heard."
720,"I know in the past some of my toughest lessons have came from intimate relationships and whilst it was painful at the time when I recognised the lesson it helped... I know it still sucks though regardless of whether you know that relationship was right for you 😂 So much comfort to you in this time of sadness. I could also relate to whats been said about improving our emotional intelligence and then wanting fullfilling connections.  For years and particularly those earliest stages of recovery  I couldnt have cared less about relationships with others, its only been very recently at a deep level that Ive admitted that quality social connections are important at all levels. I think survivors/thrivers of c-ptsd/ other traumatic experiences are more determined to have all the healthy components in these connections. We know how important they are.... "
721,"as i've continued in recovery, i find that my expectations from relationships have changed.  i'm no longer willing to 'swallow' the abuse of others as just part of their personality or make excuses for them.  in fact, i'm now more able to recognize what abuse really is, and my truth voice is finally at the fore and allowing me to speak up for myself.  some of these have been relationships of over 20 yrs.waste of time?  i don't think so.  i've learned, and continue to learn, from each and every one of them.  i take action against abuse much more quickly now and have the strength to finally stand up for myself.  each relationship along the way has taught me something that i've been able to put to use when dealing with the next one.  it's also helped me recognize within myself actions and reactions that have needed changing or eliminating.  just my experience."
722,"I have come to the conclusion that I have to do something, but I am still hesitant.Where I get my treatment I have been having an issue with another patient.  First he asked me out and I said I'm recently divorced and not interested.  Then he asked if I would be his friend, not wanting to be mean I said yes.  The next time I saw him I was going into and appointment and he was going out.  When I left the building he was standing there with flowers.  I thanked him for the flowers and again told him I was not interested.  He said I made that clear, but he wanted to be a friend.  Then he watched me walk to my car.  He also got my phone number, but I didn't give it to him.  He started texting and I again told him I was not interested, he said he understood and that wasn't his intention.  Then the weird texts started.  ""I'm walking down by the creek and I'm thinking of you and tears are dripping down my face thinking of your beauty."" I also received a few calls.  The last time he saw me I going into an appointment when I got done he was standing by my car, gave me roses, a statue, and told me he loved me.  He also complained about the facility and told me they misunderstood him, the doctor called security, and he is flagged (employees alerted) for potential violence.  He also told me he carries a gun and has to leave it in his car while he is at the facility.  Since that event I sent a text to never contact or text me again.  I received an immediate text in response.  That night I went to the hospital for a few days, when I got out there were two voicemails.  One angry that I was mean and broke his heart.  The other was asking me to forgive him for whatever he did.  A few days passed and I got another text telling me ""I MISS MY SPECIAL FRIEND.""  Then three full weeks passed and I thought it was over and I just got more texts, links to love songs.So I've been rescheduling appointments to not be around when I think he is there.  I plan escape routes and change where I park.  I circle the parking lot looking for his car.  I stopped going to yoga at the facility.  I have channeled James Bond, pretty well I must admit.  I'm thinking it is enough, but I know how this goes.  First, I have to make a statement, then he denies it, but I had let security read my phone.  Then he blames me, says I led him on, and I was nice.  I become the bad person, blamed, and wonder if anyone really believes me.  The truth was I was never confrontational or not nice to him when I saw him.  I even engaged in some conversations, when he started it.  Like I told him I never had an issue with the facility.  I even told him I had to go and pick up my son who is a senior in high school at one point.  Three times when confronted and not wanting to say no (afraid to say no) I said I would go to lunch but I always cancelled and never went.  This was before I told him never to contact me again and after I said I was not interested.I'm really afraid of being wrong, not believed, being made out to be that bad person, of making him more angry.  I could use some perspective.  "
723,"This sounds like a very uncomfortable and threatening situation. I'm sorry you have to go through it.Have you spoken to the facility staff about his actions? Since he's creating a threatening environment for others, maybe they can take some responsibility here. I'd be curious how he got your number, for example. Maybe they can assist with scheduling, or maybe they even have a process in case someone is harassing others.If you have to file a restraining order, I wish you luck and strength.  "
724,"I would recommend you contacting the police & filing a report, to start a paper trail. There's a free app called Aspire, it's got some pretty cool features like dialing 911 for you, recording conversations when prompted, etc. http://www.whengeorgiasmiled.org/aspire/ (The app is for people in violent relationships but don't let that stop you.)Let your friends know you have a stalker and definitely let your therapist know. Give your friends a secret password that, if you use it when talking to them, lets them know you're in danger. It may be a good idea to keep your GPS on your phone turned on. Stay safe "
725,Here's more info -http://m.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-a-Stalker#qa_headline
726,"If you have a library get out 'The Gift of fear', by Gavin de Becker.  Read the entire section on stalkers and take every bit of advice.  It won't make you more afraid,  de Becker is an international  authority on dealing with stalkers, and gives incredibly detailed information.  My God, this guy carries a gun and is flagged for violence!I feel the care provider has let you down in leaving you to deal with this.  I feel they should have taken immediate and decisive action to protect you.  I know how freaked out I've been by a couple of harmless stalkers.  This should never have happened to you.  You have been let down.Please keep us informed so you at least know you have a team of supporters, (as inadequate an an online support group is for this kind of situation). "
727,"I know the facility will take action if I decide to pursue it.  My therapist knows and we discussed ways to stay safe.  I am afraid of reporting is the problem.  Also, because of my control issues and my reactions to feeling disempowered and disclosure they are cautious to do anything without me.  I need to report it.  Also, I think we all thought this was over.  The new texts have prompted me to believe I have to take action, but I'm so afraid of doing so.  I also wonder because of the time elapse that maybe it isn't as serious now?  Only a few texts, three weeks after the last ones.  He has never threatened me, only told me he loves me and I hurt him, broke his heart.  And what can they do anyway, talk to him?  Seriously, that will just make it worse or make him more angry I think.  I'm not sure there is a win here.I'm really afraid of being wrong, not believed, being made out to be that bad person, of making him more angry.  And of course, there is the thought, that I must have done something to cause this.My therapist is on vacation this week and I'll see her next Monday.  I do see my psychiatrist and could talk to him this week.  My head is spinning.  The sad part is I could of seen my therapist this week, but it was the same day as this stalker guy is there so I canceled my appointment she is gone the rest of the week. Radical - I'm going to look up the book now, e-books.  Maybe I won't feel so stupid, crazy, overreactive."
728,"Sorry to hear this Dee, its the last thing you need right now. Without being an alarmist, I believe this needs intervention no matter how harmless this seems. I suggest saving the texts you have already as legal proof, not answering any further texts received, and blocking his phone number for both calls and texts if your phone has that function as a start.Three Roses' idea is good. You might not get far with the police, but starting a paper trail will be good for any further incidences down the track, there may be one on him already from someone else, or you may create one that will eventually support the next victim.Finally, try and seek legal counsel. Is there a free service you can contact to discuss options? Hang in there Dee, you're doing well. Keep checking in.I might check out those books at a later stage, wish I knew of them when I needed them "
729," You're not stupid, you were trying to be sensitive to another human being. You're not crazy, you are concerned. You're not over-reacting, you are taking steps to be safe and that's what you should be doing. Without being too much of an alarmist, chances are slim that just the passing of time means he's lost interest. Be safe. We are here for you, Dee. "
730,"Three Roses, agreed.Your safety comes first Dee  "
731,"Maybe this isn't the best advice right now, but in the future I would recommend reading up on assertiveness. It can be a weak point for PTSD people. I too can have trouble saying no to people because I don't want to be mean (and hurt people as I was hurt), but saying 'no' isn't mean - it can actually be kind, because it doesn't lead to misunderstandings.Your fears of being wrong, not believed, to blame, being (seen as) a bad person, and making him angrier are all related to your initial abuser and not this guy, which might help to think about. I'd call the police and tell him off. There's absolutely no reason you wouldn't be believed - no one knows/trusts/likes this guy and you have texts to prove what he said. Being seen as a bad person is also a fear that someone else gave you, because you're not a bad person, end of story. Fear of angering him, beyond if you're actually frightened of him attacking you, might actually be a feeling of other-people's-happiness-matters-more-than-mine coming through, which seems to be the same reason you initially said yes to him, even though you weren't interested. And given your PTSD and your past (which I can only guess at), saying 'yes' that one time was very reasonable as an action to a) keep you safe from people and their anger and b) not hurt people as you were hurt. So this problem has everything to do with him and nothing to do with you - he could have picked anyone and the situation would be the same. I'm just offering this analysis/insight in the hopes that thinking through this practically might help you to see that HE'S the crazy one (and whoever hurt you is probably crazy too), and NOT you.Good luck! Hope that helps. Don't doubt yourself or dismiss his mistreatment of you. And good job telling him to leave you alone!"
732,"Riverstar, you are all over it.  Assertiveness and assertiveness rights are something I have been working on in therapy.  I have made a lot of progress, but when I am scared or panicked I forget it.  And yes, my issues do stem from my initial and most significant abuser.  I do however believe that some people can sense an easy target and as much as I am working, I think it still radiates from me.  I am making a lot of improvement on being less passive.Contessa, thanks, it is the last thing I need right now, but I also know this was a part of what led to my recent spiral.  I was so busy trying to tell myself that it wasn't bothering me that I wasn't validating my own emotions and triggers.  I am not going to do that anymore.Three Roses, I checked out the site and I appreciate the advice.  As always, you are very supportive and helpful.All, I appreciate the support greatly and the advice was sound.  I made of list of ideas to keep me safe from your suggestions.  I also decided to talk to someone but I have yet to decide if I will do it Wednesday or wait until Monday when I see my therapist."
733,"dee, best to you with this.  absolutely, number one is to stay safe, and that probably means getting the authorities involved.  all the advice and tips you've gotten here are on point.  one thing i've learned is that i don't have to be 'nice' to strangers.  i don't have to accept advances, gifts, invitations, texts, calls, anything.  for future reference, this is something i learned from my husband, who's had a lot of experience dealing with people who are shady or have hidden agendas.  he's told me to use the word 'no' without hesitation or explanation, because otherwise these types of people misread the hesitant 'no' as a possibility for a future 'yes'.you weren't crazy, nor stupid, only reacting to the script that had been set up for you.  we have been taught to be 'nice to others' to our own detriment.   as far as people not believing you, or thinking you're weird, you have enough evidence as to the truth of what's going on.  all my support for you as you pursue this, and best of everything for a swift and positive resolution for you.  this kind of thing just sucks!"
734,"My therapist and I discussed it.  I am doing some writing about my thoughts, fears, and we are picking up the conversation next week.  She said she doesn't want me more hyper vigilant than I already am.  She did acknowledge that this guy is about the same age as my dad and how that is playing into it a lot.  So....to be continued.  Until then I'm in James Bond mode."
735,Stay safe! I've been thinking of you  
736,"A quick update.  Because it has been several weeks since any incidents, and the contact continuously decreases we are leaving this.  Right now I really don't have a complaint.  Yet, I think part of that is because of the precautions I take not to have any contact.  I park in staff parking, thinking he won't look for my car there.  I look for him before I move anywhere.  I did once see him in a parking lot as I was exiting a building and I was very brave and hid behind a truck until he left.  I do think if he sees me there will be confrontation.  Yet, I am not being harassed with text messages or phone calls any longer.  So being cautious with optimism.  Just sucks that I had to stop some things I did at the facility like yoga.  However, the lack of contact has decreased my stress level."
737,"My awareness of my cptsd and codependency came to the fore with the death of my Mother four years ago, following a prolonged (8 year)  decline due to a series of strokes.  Stripped bare, I suddenly had to deal with all of the feelings and layers of pain that I had stuffed for over 50 years.  Since then, I have made substantial progress in my healing journey.  Now, I am coping with what seems to be one in a series of health challenges that my wife is experiencing.  I am working to remain grounded, and in her eyes I am doing a remarkable job being kind, loving, and attentive.  To me, however, the daily work of staying grounded is nearly too much to bear.  I am aware of my tendency to give too much, so am making sure to keep doing nurturing things for myself (running, reading, seeing friends).  But the illness is nearly constantly bringing on a cascading series of EFs and even daily meditation cannot generally bring me back to myself.  I just wanted to share this part of my struggle with those on this site, as it helps to get it off my chest and perhaps can open a door to another who is also supporting  loved one who is ill.  I will come out of this stronger than before, but as my byline says, the commitment truly is daily."
738,So sorry to hear what you're going thru now. I send to you my warmest thoughts and wishes for peace and healing for you both.  
739,I am so sorry to hear this JDog.  I knew your wife was having medical issues but not that it was affecting you so much. I can only imagine though that the EFs have increased.  FWIW it sounds like you are doing things to keep as grounded and well as you can in the midst of all this including coming here for support.  I hope you will continue to do so if/when you're up to it.     Would an online caregivers support group also be helpful do you think?  Just a thought.  
740,"Thank you both for your support.  In answer to your question, Kizzie,  I don't think I need an ongoing support group at this time but I appreciate the thought.  If there are others out there who feel they may need such a group I would be happy to contribute my support."
741,"The self care you are practicing is something to be emulated.  It's hard to keep the mask on when it is cracking.  We are here to listen, that sounds like what you need.  Friends who care."
742,"Thank you so much, Dee.  Both she and I are doing better now."
743,Glad to hear you're both doing better JDog!      and   
744, 
745,"Hi everyone,I've been thinking lately about regrets. Things I have done that I wish I had not done, or handled differently.In the past, I would avoid taking responsibility for my actions out of fear of reprisal. In the last decade, I became beaten down by compound traumas, heavily internalized all criticism, and my inner critic - combined with low self-esteem -  convinced me that everything was my fault. So then I swung to the other extreme and took too much responsibility.While not feeling consistently stable yet, I am at a place where I am working to accept all of my actions as things I really did, things I chose either through action or inaction, and things with consequences. I want to practice self-compassion and acceptance rather than avoidance or denial, particularly in my interactions with other people, and in reclaiming my memories.Aside from the 50-50 rule, are there any techniques any of you have used to own the reality of your actions without falling into a pit of toxic shame? In particular I think this will help with my inner critic, but also when confronted with guilt trips, blame-shifting, and other manipulation tactics. Whether they are external or self-imposed.I just want to see myself realistically, if that makes sense.Thanks."
746,"When I'm really stuck beating myself up and can't stop, I try to remember to ask, ""What would I say to someone else feeling as I am now?"" Then my compassion kicks in, and I see why someone else would have done this or that, and I understand myself a little better. Hope that helps. "
747,"Couldn't stop thinking about this! So I found some good stuff online to tell you - this is from https://wehaveapples.wordpress.com/2015/09/27/youre-not-a-bad-person-weve-all-done-stupid-hurtful-things/Think back to something you did that you feel guilty about. Close your eyes and picture yourself in the situation. Look at your face, your heart Were you acting out of pain, confusion, or fear? Were you looking for love in all the wrong places? Were you broken, sad, or at a rough point in your life? I bet you were.You werent rubbing your hands together and cackling an evil laugh. Muahahaha You arent a monster who wanted to hurt yourself or someone else because thats your fun hobby. You are a human and humans mess up. Humans make big mistakes. Humans do stupid, hurtful things. Humans are human.Its time to stop playing that movie in your mind of the crappy thing you did to show yourself how bad you are and how much you need to be punished. Its time to forgive that broken person who did something they regret. If you havent apologized, apologizing is a good idea. If you have apologized, good, now move forward.Why dont I want you to keep beating yourself up? Because guilt zaps all this great energy you could use to focus on doing better in the future. It zaps energy you could be using to do nice, helpful things. Making yourself feel guilty just makes you want to do more destructive stuff. Its counterproductive.Guilt is toxic to the spirit. It chokes life and life needs to breathe. Yes, learn from your mistakes. No, dont carry guilt anymore. Its heavier than an elephant doing weight training. (How cute would an elephant look with a sweatband, though?)Youre not a bad person and youre not alone in this feeling. No one talks about the crappy things theyve done because its not good dinner conversation! LolHey, want to hear the weird, hurtful thing I said when I was 14Um No. Lets just eat ice cream and talk about Orange Is The New Black.Even the sweetest people make hurtful mistakes. Look back on what you did and look at your intention. Maybe it was an honest mistake.. Maybe you were uneducated and didnt know any better.. Maybe you were afraid.. Maybe you were so broke you couldnt afford the dollar menu at McDonalds.. (been there!) Maybe someone hurt you so you hurt someone else.. Maybe you didnt feel loved so you did something negative for attention.. Maybe you didnt feel accepted so you did something mean to fit in.. Maybe you were doing your best for where you were in life.Whatever happened its time to stop showing it to yourself because beating yourself up is an act of inner violence. Its time to hug that person who royally messed up and tell them, Its OK and lets work to do better in the future.Treat yourself as you would a dear friend. Would you remind them every day of their biggest mistake in life? No! Thats cruel. So why are you doing it to yourself? Being compassionate to yourself is an act of service to God and to the world because inner kindness, becomes outer kindness which becomes world kindness. If you cant be nice to yourself for yourself, do it for God and for your fellow humans.You are not a bad person Unless you did do that evil laugh thing and rubbed your hands together MuahahahahaLove you! Rachie"
748,"Hi Three Roses, thanks for both your comments. That blog post does have some good advice.I can't help but also think of others when I read things like that. I'm not sure if this is still some low-self-esteem that deflects the attention from myself, or avoidance, or something else. I do some mental gymnastics below - please bear with me.When I do start to think more compassionately towards myself, I end up thinking ""well people that hurt me must have been going through similar things - they just made a mistake - I should forgive them apologize for my own mistakes and give them another chance. After all, I want to make it right between us; wouldn't they?"" And what usually happens when I act on that thought is that I have opened the door to continued violations. Often I apologize but the other party never does, which leaves me with secondary wounding. Or worse, continued or escalating transgressions. Only a couple times in my life has the ideal scenario in my head worked out in real life where we both accept our part in the hurt and make ammends to each other.So I guess my past faulty thinking and experiences make me wary of even self-compassion and self-esteem. This is definitely my inner critic talking. I have been trying to see my inner critic as a misguided ally. And if that's true, it's so misguided that nothing I do can satisfy it. This means that even though I want to show it compassion, I have to prioritize self-compassion and self-esteem for me as 3/4 a person, instead of me as a whole. I have to practice excluding the inner critic until I am comfortable practicing compassion for myself above others. So this does require a shift in my current thinking and practices. I think people have referred to it as putting your own oxygen mask first... I guess I get it now. I don't know why such simple things are so hard, but they are.Clear as mud!  "
749," You know, I really hate the expression ""forgive and forget"". Yes, definitely forgive (if/when you can), but don't forget! We need to remember the lessons life is giving us, or we're doomed to get more of the same lessons. Sometimes, forgiveness needs to be from a distance. In other words, forgive the person but cut ties. (Harder to do when it's family. )  People who hurt us do so from their own reservoir of pain, under the surface, that we know nothing about. But forgiveness doesn't have to mean remaining attached to that person. Forgiveness is just releasing them, and yourself. Distancing yourself is self-protection, like backing away from the crumbling edge of a cliff; unless they are also involved in some pursuit of healing, they're going to repeat their offenses. You're not responsible for healing them, or for their happiness. That's their job. Forgive them, yes; apologize for your part in it, if applicable, yes; give them another chance, not necessarily. "
750,"if i could butt in here for a moment - i've gone back and forth with the idea of forgiveness, and have finally decided that, at this point in my life, i don't have it in me,  what i've done instead is handed it over to the powers that be to do it for me, if that's what's warranted.  that has saved me from worrying about and judging myself as to why i have trouble forgiving.  the same thing has happened to me re:  justice.  i was so upset because there would be no justice for these people who have hurt me so badly.  again, i finally figured out to hand that responsibility to another being of my creation, one with powers greater than mine.  it's her job now, and i don't have to get myself in a tizzy, or be tempted to tell people off or tell their friends/family just what kind of a low-life s/he really is.the idea of accepting ourselves includes both our strengths and our weaknesses.  we act out of our own perceptions and perspectives based on our experiences.  as does everyone.  does that excuse abusive behavior?  no.  not for a minute.  others have their own reasons for being abusive toward us, and i don't believe that's for us to try to figure out.  i think we can only act or react on the behaviors we see and experience from others.  that's our only job, to take care of ourselves as best we can."
751,"Sometimes I don't know how to give elaborate responses but I want to say this thread has helped me feel a lot better and understand the Inner Critic a lot better! Thank you all""Only a couple times in my life has the ideal scenario in my head worked out in real life where we both accept our part in the hurt and make ammends to each other.""I feel the same. And I've been working on making amends with people as well. It is a hard process. Today I had to be really assertive against my negative thoughts about myself. It took some work but even a little bit of a change in thought has been giving a great effect. Even if all I can agree on is ""I am a unique person and I'm here for me. It's okay, I'm okay.""I hope things start clearing up soon for you, Movement, but remember that your efforts each day are ""drops in the bucket"" even if you don't see the benefit yet. You're investing in YOU and you should proud of yourself for that.Hugs"
752,"I was doing well enough, really was too busy to think this week. Most of the time, things were decent. Now I've sat down for the first time in 5 days with nothing to do and am suddenly in a major EF. I'll explore it in my journal. But the dominant feeling is guilt, so I guess the Critic noticed things were too quiet. On top of this, I've had escalating physical pain from work over the course of the week. I wonder if there might be a link.I feel like I did when I was first coming out of the fog. I feel compelled to contact exes and apologize for things in the past. Most things I have already apologized for.I was raised to be a critical thinker. Mostly I feel that was a blessing and I see it as one of my defining traits. Tonight, however, it's causing me to want ""proof"", empirical evidence, that I am not permanently broken.  Intellectually, I understand that I am fine, just one in the spectrum of humanity. Emotionally, though, I still have times where I believe I destroy everything good in my life. I won't dwell more... I think that would only empower the Critic.For what it's worth, I'm trying to give it Jon Lovitz's voice to humorously diffuse it. ""It stinks!"""

Tonight, however, it's causing me to want ""proof"", empirical evidence, that I am not permanently brokenAwesome! Use It!http://physics.ucr.edu/~wudka/Physics7/Notes_www/node6.htmlWhat is the ``scientific method''?  The scientific method is the best way yet discovered for winnowing the truth from lies and delusion. The simple version looks something like this:1. Observe some aspect of the universe.2. Invent a tentative description, called a hypothesis, that is consistent with what you have observed.3. Use the hypothesis to make predictions.4. Test those predictions by experiments or further observations and modify the hypothesis in the light of your results.5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no discrepancies between theory and experiment and/or observation.When consistency is obtained the hypothesis becomes a theory and provides a coherent set of propositions which explain a class of phenomena. A theory is then a framework within which observations are explained and predictions are made.Seriously, make lists and other logical-thinking stuff (I'm writing as an outsider here, I'm truly not a critical thinker)write it out, go ahead, give yourself permission to have what you need :-) "
754,"escalating pain from work, huh?  sounds like there may be issues there that are being shoved down into your body instead of being brought out and dealt with.  i'm quite tuned into this concept at the moment, having gone thru a horrible body release of issues and emotions the other night.  they were all stored in there for many, many years, and i hope no one ever has to go through that.i was thinking i was broken as well, but i'm beginning to see evidence that it's not the case.  just old crapola that creeps in and makes me doubt myself.  i hope you find your way thru the maze, mftb.  it can be confusing, off-putting, and disorienting at times.  big hug!"
755,"If I can pin down one narrow belief about myself, I will happily subje t it too the scientific method. Currently, I think all my hypotheses are too broad, like ""I am unlovable to the men I find attractive"" or ""I am broken"". I want to find something specific to examine because I think those will be easier to disprove. Will post again if I think of one. It means listening to my critic which I have been trying to not do anymore.My new job is very active, on a concrete floor, in new steel-toed boots.  I think the pain is mostly from that, and would be worse if I hadn't made lots of effort to get outside while unemployed. I've had knee problems for a long time and pain off and on for the last 16 years. I've tried to address this through physio and yoga but get sidetracked easily. When I am active, it's generally better.  I didn't do yoga at all until today and I I suffered for it. I'm majorly stiff and achy from the hips down, especially my knees. I'm icing them now.This week, it was more about overdoing it, I think. I had work all week plus my CSA Survivors Group therapy. That really stirs things up, then I don't have a chance to process until the weekend, so, today. And that's how it'll be until group ends at the end of Nov.As for the emotional issues... Was it you that once said it was like whack-a-mole? Because yeah, it is. I address some and others keep popping up. Or older ones resurface when I thought I had addressed them. Like the regrets.I'm trying to sit with the loneliness tonight. I am lonely. I have regrets from relationships that have directly or indirectly led to me being alone now, despite me believing it's best that I'm not with these guys. I still want somone to love, and who can love me, in healthy ways.I do mostly forgive myself, but still get urges to apologize too much and prostrate myself in order to feel secure. I've had plenty of well-meaning people tell me to stop apologizing. It's almost instinctual... I've gotten better but still have to really check myself to make sure I do actually need to apologize for anything.And I don't feel secure yet, though things are improving in my life. I need my own place. Staying at my friends' place is good, but it's not a home of my own. So overall, lots of instability coupled with some hard labour has made me an achy, unsettled marshmallow. I think that's a funny image. Tonight's mission is to give some love to my inner marshmallow."
756,"Today I allowed myself for better or worse to wallow in self-pity.  I am really upset with my sister lately due to recent events.  She is the only one to know that last month I almost killed myself (feeling better now, past action) but it was a serious attempt and I am alive due to medical intervention.  She knew that and she got into an argument with me.  I asked her if she was trying to kill me, she said ""so you're calling me a murderer.""  A few days later she apologized, but I don't think I'm ready yet to have anything to do with her.  She never apologizes and it is a big step, but I'm not there.  I really, honestly, felt she doesn't care at all.  It hit me like a ton of bricks.  Considering last year I moved across the country to be near her.  Now, I have no real friends here and a family I cannot deal with right now.  Though I have two wonderful children who are 16 and 19, but so grown and independent.  I also do not talk about my struggles because I don't want them to feel they have to be the parent.  They think I was in the hospital with an acute kidney infection.  So today I crawled into bed, a place I hate, and pulled the covers over my head for the entire day.  I just felt so alone.  By not talking to my sister right now I know I am practicing self-care, but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt."
757,"Hi Dee, I'm glad you're practicing self care. Some days you just need a bed day. Big hugs to you.  "
758," I think allowing yourself to feel your feelings is a good thing, even when they hurt like #%*! I'm sorry to hear the reaction your commitment to family has gotten you, and sorry to hear you feel so alone. It may not be ""the real thing"", not like a physical presence, but we care about you and are here for you. "
759,virtual love is always good!  thank you!
760,"dee, i have days of private pity parties, too.  i decided that, since no one else felt bad for me, i was just going to indulge myself for myself.  not very often, but when i felt the need, what the hey!  so, i hope you do just exactly what you want today, keep being good to yourself (as best you can) and, yeah, altho we can't be there in person, we're here for you in spirit.  sending love to help ease the pain."
761,"Hey Dee, sending you a ton of    and much support. So sorry to hear what a tough time you've had.  IMO you have every reason to show yourself some self-compassion so pull those covers up and rest.  (FWIW I don't think it's self pity you're feeling but very deep and real sadness in response to your sister's behaviour.)   "
762,"Oh Dee,I'm glad you did what you needed.  I wish it would take some of the pain awayThis tripe about self-pity so many of us have been fed all out lives is rubbish.  My heart aches for what you've been through and so should your's.  There may be some people who have  a problem with self-indulgent over-compassion for themselves, but you are not one of them. This is one of the things I think Pete Walker gets right.  We haven't had enough compassion from others and we haven't learned to be compassionate enough to ourselves.  For years I've been as harsh to myself as my parents were to me and it's helped me as much as my parents did - stuff all.  We need a different model, not more of the same.  It's not just empty words, eventually with enough practice, compassion towards ourselves does start to sink-in and change those unhealthy attitudes we have toward ourselves.I'm so sorry you felt so alone, and so glad you're still here.  I really feel that, I hope sometime you'll feel it too. "
763,"Well said, radical! "

767,"I once read a piece entitled ""Marry Yourself: Creating Sacred Vows for Self-Love"". Cool heading, at least. Recently I stopped back and re-read the vows. Some of the ones that stood out for me were:I vow to comfort myself during times of hopelessness, despair, depression, disillusionment, or any difficulty that arises.I vow to be my Beloved always and in all ways.I vow to never settle or abandon myself in romantic partnerships again.I vow to live in the faith my life unfolds in mysterious imperfect perfection. I vow to honour my calling and live my life as a work of art.I altered a couple and the author doesn't list some others, but the concept is something I like; despite my resistance  to vows in general--they remind me of religious abusers from my youth who started their thought-control by implanting things like confirmation vows into very vulnerable minds. Only they treated those seemingly innocent vows as a license and shield, behind which they inflicted their cruel and multiple abuses down the road. In the process of living an individual life in a social world, it's easy to also blindly accept that one's task is to blend in as much as possible. While that's sometimes more amenable to peace, there is that tug to remain true to self, or even find it at all.The elephant in the room--the objector to the vows? Inner Critic and her/his pals behind that door labeled CPTSD. At the very least, they'd love for you to forget that you count. While all the vows touch on areas I'm sensitive to, what leaps out  for me is ""vowing to comfort myself"" paired with the declaration to ""live my life as a work of art.""  To some, this is but a leap into narcissistic fantasy. Taken to the extreme, perhaps so. But to a damaged soul, someone who easily slips into self-abandonment and self-loathing, who painfully stands aside when others pummel him; someone who tries to salvage pride in retreat, etc., it's too familiar and devastating to fall to implications of selfishness, narcissism, and the social anxiety about self-love. I share that, actually--obviously self-love can become over the top; and it can indeed lead to self-absorption, way beyond mere self-love.It somehow has to start with self, to an extent. But given the viciousness of what happened coming out of a CPTSD environment, it's huge just to get a distant view of any kind of love, whether it be from self or anywhere else. It's that small step again--but because of how we're made up, self can be the only first step we can truly experience. Then the boundaries can be found; and too the limits of self. But it seems like many on this forum are still desperate for that first step, that little twinge of self-worth.So a concept like 'marrying oneself' can indeed seem silly to the socially conscious. But guess what? There's a spectrum of people for whom it's crucial to find love wherever they can, and rediscover the first step. In my case, it seems like that was a bruising stumble and not a step; all my energy became defensive and desperate to find safe ground. They said there was love out there, and I never found it. In the process, I missed the first vow, and only now am daring to return and rediscover that ambushed self hiding within.I'm not presently married, but if the unlikely happened and it came about, I'd  start with these vows to self, and anticipate my partner might also be so inclined. It's a two-way waltz, but we take all the steps on our own as well.-----The link for the article referred to above is:http://tinybuddha.com/blog/marry-yourself-creating-sacred-vows-for-self-love/"
768,"I very much relate to all of this.  It was good to read it because it is so much where i am at, struggling hard to find ways to value and validate myself.  I don't care anymore how silly anything might sound to anyone else, it's urgent that I find ways to make some kind of commitment to give to myself the things I needed but never received, when I was growing up.  I have to rely on myself, but i never learned how to protect myself, and I've seen far to much of the darkness in humanity as a result, which has left me scrambling to find safety instead of reaching out for happiness for so long now.I'm on that spectrum of people you have described so eloquently, and I'm grateful to be able to dare to take these steps for myself alongside good people like yourself.  I like the word ""dare"" "
769,"beautiful concept, woodsgnome."
770,"Problem is, I'm pretty sure I only want one to fill the gaps in affection I've had growing up. Anything romantic I've attempted thus far has crashed and burned really hard. And I can't get out of the mindset ""They would never be interested in someone like me."" Plus, at this stage in my life I'm not really able to hold down a job and am pretty dependent on others for my needs. This whole thing is just a crazy whirlwind of emotion...I hate this feeling so much.  "
771,   
772,"me, too.  hate it!"
773,I really understand   
774,"Hello all. For me, and I assume many us here, the ability to trust people is strained. Sometimes it is warranted but times we need to work on our selves to let it happen. This is something I need to work on, and really want to. Has anybody else been able to work on this aspect of their relationships to work toward healthier relationships with others?"
775,"i've discovered that the more i've been able to trust myself, the more i am able to trust others.  i'm not all the way there yet, but a lot of my non-trust of others concerned expectations of me in all facets of my life.since i was raised to be 'perfect' and those were the expectations of my dad for me, nothing imperfect was allowed by me re: emotions, feelings, attitude, the ever-ready smile, 'being there' for others, putting others first, sharing my time and energy no matter what was going on with me, and on and on.  i took those expectations seriously.  the result was that i didn't know myself, couldn't feel anything from others, became non-compassionate and arrogant (stayed above others so as not to have to interact with them on a personal/human level - they might see my flaws and weaknesses!) among other things.breaking down those barriers at the same time strengthening my boundaries has resulted in less fear of others expecting me to be a certain way.  for a while, when i was very sick, i contemplated not getting well because no one expects much from a chronically ill person.  but, then it dawned on me that, as wonderfully uncomplaining as my hub was in doing and getting things for me, it wasn't fair to him to stay so sick if there was a way i could get well.  so, i began the work.  he was a great motivation.today, i'm much less sick, and more trusting that i will say 'no' to things i really don't want to do, no matter who's asking.  i do have to remind myself a lot, tho, to keep moving forward.  because so many people knew me as always ready and able, they sometimes have difficulty accepting me with flaws and weaknesses now.  i can feel their expectations reaching out to me, wanting to manipulate me.  sometimes it's a tough battle, and i've learned to keep some interactions to a minimum.  the trust is growing.  "
776,"Good point, trusting yourself is a must. I certainly don't trust myself.Been thinking back on teaching where I had strong leadership and demonstrated the values, good values, I expected in my classroom... but that seems like an entirely different person. A little scared and upset at how much i've changed."
777,"curious as to where/when the change began for you.  are you no longer teaching?  is it since you found out about your traumatization?in my opinion, just finding out about this stuff can't help but change us.  at least, that's what happened to me.  once i opened this door, there was no turning back, and that initiated a big change in me, as well as my life.  but my initial change came when i became so sick that i couldn't do or be what i did and was before.  i had to learn how to take instead of give all the time, i had to allow others to help me, do for me where i had always been the helper and doer for others.  i had to put my pride in always being there for others on the side and let others be there for me.   i kept trying to do too much for myself too soon, which resulted in getting sicker.  it was a struggle.  i'd heard so many times - if you don't take care of yourself, first, you won't be able to be any good to others - and my biggest breakthrough was when i finally let that sink in.  the fear was in not being viable, not being able to contribute, not being valuable to others, which would mean i'd end up alone.  very scary stuff, indeed.one thing i heard that i liked said:  when you walk through the door of your fear, you find yourself.  the more i walk through that door, the more i'm learning, and even liking, who i really am.  i surely hope that as you come to trust yourself more, you will also learn more about who you are as well.   it's been worth it for me.  "
778,"I hope and think that the journey I'm now making in setting and maintaining boundaries will allow me to trust again. And that if trust is violated (which probably happen again at some point: I hope to live a few decades more and there are plenty of cheaters out there) I will still hold my ground and push these people away from me.I'm also pretty sure I have been naive and a people pleaser and too often trusted people when my gut said no. But since my mouth finds it so hard to say no, I 'trick' myself into 'trusting' the other.Quite probable I'm just in 'denial' at those times."
779,"I completely agree that once we learn how to trust and rely upon ourselves - which involves becoming grounded and knowing that we are good enough just as we are - trusting others becomes less of an issue. Since I cannot control others, I just have to assume that they will have varying types of responses to me based upon things that I may not even understand.  So, trusting sometimes just means believing that they do things that make sense to them (and maybe only to them).  And, it is of course nice when people behave in a somewhat reliable manner so that I can expect a certain level of support or positive behavior from them.  But, it is only my own behavior and thinking that really matters in the end."
780,"Jdog, Dutch Uncle and Sanmagic, thank you for all of these perspectives. I want to give due response but my head is overrun at the moment so can't quite do it right now.Sanmagic I would love to answer this question, it is something that I have been thinking about and dearly want to answer. Happy to share, but again, my head is overrun. Right now speaking is more helpful than writing. Can I answer later? xo"
781,"sorry this is so long overdue, contessa.  i think i got sidetracked with some of my own stuff.  anyway, yes, of course, if you want to answer the question, do so at your own pace, when you're comfortable.  i'd love to hear what came up for you.  i hope you're less overwhelmed by now, feeling a bit more stable.  big hug."
782,"I'm glad this thread was bumped up. I missed it before. Really valuable insigjts here and naturally I struggle with trust as well. The concept of trusting oneself is important and I don't think I had looked at it that way before. In a way I think not trusting others must come from the outter critic and projecting my fears onto others. Not only that, but if I do own that I don't trust myself, then I can see it as the inner critic and outer critic working in tandem, trying to protect my inner child. I do think I care for my inner child and I think I trust her... Just never thought about it before. I'm really trying to see those two critics more compassionately, too. I think by starting that way I will grow my compassion and trust to encompass my whole self. Does that make sense? I guess by trying to call a ceasefire on the war within I think I will find more peace and be more stable.Anyway, just thinking this through as I type. Thanks for starting the thread, Contessa. Would love to hear where you're at with this now."
783,"i think, that as long as it makes sense to you, that's what counts.  i never thought of bringing those two critics together in a compassionate way.  my concept of trusting myself mainly meant that i could put out my own boundaries and stick with them, and that i could say 'no' to people who wanted more than was healthy for me to give.   i used to find acceptable reasons, meaning they were acceptable to others (like saying i was sick) in order to be able to say 'no' and stick with it.  as i've built up my own inner strength, it's easier for me to just say 'no' without having to justify, rationalize, or make excuses for my unwillingness to do something someone else asks me to do.  actually, the concepts of inner and outer critics is new to me, so i never thought in those terms.  instead, i thought about old messages i'd learned along the way, unrealistic expectations that had been heaped upon me from a very young age, and how easily i had been manipulated because i never felt grounded in myself - i didn't have opinions, goals, or any kind of true awareness of who i was or who i wanted to be.  i just floated from experience to experience, made excuses for others, and always thought of everyone else before me.but, trusting others has come from being stronger in trusting myself.  as i've scraped away those messages and expectations, decided that i didn't want to be sick the rest of my life just so that people wouldn't expect things from me, more than i wanted to give/do, i worked on getting rid of all that was holding me back.  it was because i couldn't trust myself to say no and stick by it that i was untrusting of others.  i know that they will always be out there, always want more from everybody, and that i can't change them.  all i could do was change myself, so i have.  some people, even those i keep close, have been clearly disappointed that i didn't do what they wanted, but i know now that not only is it impossible for me to help that, but that taking care of me has to be, must be, my first priority.that this originated from inner and outer critics is new to me, having never heard it, really, before this forum.   you've given me something to think about.  thanks.   just my thoughts and experience."
784,"For weeks now (closer to months, really) I have wanted to ask my friends for help but can't seem to do it due to issues surrounding self-worth. I feel intense shame about needing help and fear judgement and gossip when I am vulnerable.  I drafted a letter to send to my friends last month, asking for help, but haven't found courage to send it.Quick background for the uninitiated is that I ""left"" my relationship but don't have anywhere to go so we are still sharing a bed and apartment like super awkward roommates.   I was going to move back to my home city with a friend but her living arrangement is delayed at least 6 months. I found this out too late to hold off on the breakup and other circumstances forced my hand. Family there is the source of my cptsd so they are out.In my current city I do have a couple places I can crash for a few weeks. But 6 months is too long to be couch-hopping and imposing on my friends and their families. Vacancy rate is extremely low in my city so just finding a new place is out. Also, everyone has small places so space is an issue.I have reached out to a couple friends in my home city to let them know what's up with me, but only a couple. Friends in the current city are supportive, but unable to help much. The couple friends I reached out to in the home city have offered to help but I still balk at asking to stay with them until I find a job & place. It just feels like I would be asking too much of people who have full lives and families.I feel unworthy of the help I need to get back on my feet in part because I won't be able to repay quickly if at all and in part because I think I have not been a good enough friend to deserve the help. The people I have confided in are folks I consider good friends, but I have not been an attentive friend from a distance. CPTSD also made me easily triggered and argumentative the last few years before I understood I needed help so I think I have burnt bridges but am too scared to find out if it's true. The other aspect of this is that I am afraid that I could end up somewhere in a triggering situation that is worse than my current situation.Not sure what kind of feedback I hope for, here. I guess I am hoping by admiting and publicizing it I can diminish the fears into more manageble sizes. Thanks for reading."
785,"Sometimes it helps me to ask myself how it would feel if the situation were reversed. If my friend came to me with the same problem, what would I say? Everyone needs help sometimes. Give yourself permission to need help, and to receive that same help you would give a friend in need. Hugs to you! "
786,"Hi movementforthebetter, I can relate.The fact that friends have offered you to come ""couch-hopping"" indicates to me that your fears of ""not been a good enough friend to deserve the help"" are unwarranted.Surely they wouldn't have offered it if they really did think of you like that, no?But that is logic, and the emotional reaction you have is different, and is equally as valid.I understand, and agree, that six months of couch-hopping is a bit much.You say ""Vacancy rate is extremely low in my city so just finding a new place is out."". Is it perhaps an option to ask all these supportive people you have if they can look out for vacancies? I have had a similar problem 15 years back, and in the end I find the apparent I have been living in since via-via-via friends. One friend knew of another friend (of his, I didn't know her) who would vacate her apartment. That apartment sucked, but next door there was an empty apartment, and I could rent that in the end. I've been happy here since.Perhaps the same might apply for a job?Telling people you are looking for something, even if you think they might not be able to help you directly (or you may even be sure of that) might still get you going.Asking people for help is a real barrier for me too, and even when I managed to get passed that, then accepting the help I'm being offered becomes the next hurdle. ""Am I worthy?"" pops up in my head. Much like your ""I won't be able to repay quickly if at all"" you wrote. I surmise.Fortunately there are people giving away stuff for free. Or they might even be 'repaying' you for something you never expected to get a refund for.   "
787,"Ok, here's my letter. I've decided to wait until next week to send it as this weekend is the final long weekend of summer and the last before kids are back in school.Feedback on the letter would be appreciated if you have any. How's the length and tone? I'm sure I'm overthinking this and I can't help it!Hello, friends!I hope this letter finds you well.Life was busy, time flew, and I wish I had kept more in touch. I hope you are all in good chapters of your lives or writing the plots you wish to follow soon.I am writing you as a way to say hello and reconnect with those of you that are open to it! I realize lives are busy and full so this letter comes without expectation, just my warmest regards for you and our memories together.I am in a period of growth and change, myself. I'm preparing to move back to Hometown! I will be doing this alone, and have decided to leave my relationship of 9 years. This has been a very hard decision and means starting over.I've done a lot of reflection this year on the things that are really important to me. I've also been doing a lot of personal work but that's a longer story.I am reluctant to impose but I am in a vulnerable position and I do need help to get back on track. If you can please assist, I am very grateful and humbled. My family situation is complicated and I can't ask them for  help.1) Does anyone have any job contacts in Hometown that would be willing to consider someone planning to relocate to the city? My timeline is currently set for mid-late October or later. I am also looking for work myself. Most people are reluctant to consider candidates from outside the city. I'm not able to come sooner as I was summoned for jury duty in Sept-Oct. Lucky me, getting to perform a valuable civic duty! Of course, I might not even be selected. If I can't find work before I get there it's my first priority when I do get there. I'm also applying for jobs here but haven't had many bites yet. It makes more sense for me to make the transition back to Hometown sooner than later as the job and housing situation is tight out here.2) I'm also looking for a couch or spare room to crash for a bit. Even some floor, I have a sleeping pad. Again, not being in the city yet, this is challenging, but I am looking. I would prefer to stay close to transit as I won't have a car at this time. Please keep me in mind if you know anyone with space. I can contribute to the household as needed except full rent until I am working. Anyone need a house-sitter, pet-sitter, or baby-sitter? Time would be a few weeks to a few months *at most* while I get a job and place nailed down as fast as I can.Thanks for reading, and know my best wishes are with you regardless of anything you can offer, or if you are able to respond. I hope to see you in person before long!Mftb"
788, 
789,"Thanks for the thumbs up! I also had a call with a friend I don't usually talk to, who is on her own healing path. We talked a lot about asking for help.I realize now that part of my problem is that I am holding some memories and resentments and guilt from the past. I have expectations around who should help and who won't. Naughty outter critic aiding and abetting my inner critic on this. Having expectations about where help will come from is also holding me back from asking, along with my earlier recognized issues. I had myself into a no-win situation in my head. Needing help was proof for my inner critic that I was bad. If I couldn't get help it would be proof for the inner critic that I was bad, and if the help came from the ""wrong"" or unexpected source, that would still be proof I was bad because the inner critic would judge me based on the kind of help I am able to get while the outter critic judges who does and doesn't respond or provide help and what kind. And all of this is really because of messages I internalized growing up that it is wrong to need or accept help. It's not!Now that I recognize this, and really understand that no (wo)man is an island, I feel better about it. I can let the chips fall where they may. I needed help even to get to this point so I'm glad I confronted my inner cast of characters. And whoever helps will be welcome and greeted with a fresh perspective. As needed I will forgive myself and others for past actions, not because I have to, but because now I am free to.Will update again once sent and some responses come in."
790,Can't wait!  
791,"Today I sent the letter. I sent it to 30 people. That was a huge number of people and a huge step for me. I figured the more I contact, the more likely someone will be able to help. Law of averages and all that.I sent the message via facebook and included a private email address people could respond to. I figured if people knew how much I was reaching out it would again increase my odds of success. The private email could save embarrassment of public replies. Because it was on facebook, I had to go letter by letter through the alphabet to add recipients, and each face that popped up caused a little emotional flashback as I remembered our history and whether or not we had any unsettled issues - wheter or not I could trust the person and whether or not it would even be safe to tell them the most basic info about my current situation.I felt absolutely sick but managed to push send before I left for therapy. I didn't want to look in case no one responded or all responses were negative. And then the first one popped up on my phone when I was writing a journal entry. An old classmate who might have a couch. Then more came in. I ended up with 11 leads of job contacts or places to stay. I couldn't even read them all, I started crying on the bus.I have been physically exhausted since therapy. My target today was linked to personal safety and my ability to use my voice. It really tied in to the act of reaching out for help, which I was terrified of. I can tell I have a lot more grieving to do, and will journal about that soon. This is so overwhelming(ly positive) and I am so grateful for the support I have found here. I don't think I could have found the courage to reach out on my own."
792, 
793,"movementforthebetter,i am so happy for you that you found the strength, courage, and determination to do what you did, and the frosting on that cake are all those positive responses you got!  yay!!!  that is so cool!"
794,Thats fantastic well done you  
795,"Been thinking of object constancy the past couple weeks. I realized my lack of secure attachments in childhood means I have a tough time believing I am cared about when I am not with the people in my life, including family, friends, and significant others.I have one friend who is the exception. She frequently texts me to see how I am and asks specifically about things I spoke of, so I know she thinks of me and cares. But with pretty much everyone else in my life, contact is more random and I have a lot of trouble imagining them as thinking of me when we aren't in contact.Worse, I have some selfishness in me and I can forget to think about others very much in a meaningful way when I am not with them and life gets busy. I am embarrassed that I have many friendships I neglected over the years. I have found small gifts I never sent, sealed and addressed letters never sent, promises left unfulfilled for various reasons. I can be a terrible flake at times and it fills me with guilt and shame. I know communication is a two way street and I did not keep up my end well. Things always start out well and then trail off into silence over time. I don't count social media interactions as meaningful.Communication is one of my main life values, ironically. Both despite and because of my upbringing. It's a life's work.I made some efforts to meaningfully reconnect with people this year and mostly it has gone better than I expected. But now I'm encountering a challenge I must have burried in the past: the pain of missing people.Whenever people I am used to being in contact with are unavailable for a time, I miss them intensely. I start to think of them too much now, sometimes nearing obsession. I don't think it's normal and it doesn't seem healthy. It hurts to have a hole in me that is the exact size and shape of a person I care about. I think that the repeated pains might actually be why I have let things fade in the past. I desparately feared loneliness without knowing the deeper reasons why. It was like repeatedly grieving people when parted for too long.I think I am now face to face with my fear of abandonment, even though I have done some EMDR on it and somehow thought that meant it should be resolved. What it actually means is I am now in the position to face it and feel it which I had not been allowing myself to do for years.My inner child is crying out to every person I become close with to not be left alone. It must be so off-putting to those that perceive the neediness. I know I would find it unattractive. But tonight I will listen to my inner child's needs and try my best to soothe her and remind her that she will never be alone because she has me to be with her now.  I hope that is enough to comfort myself, too. If it isn't I'm not sure what will be."
796,"Hi movementforthebetter,I can relate to the flakiness as im the same even down to unsent gifts/letters.  I have trouble keeping in touch with people and it makes me feel bad. Good on you for making more of an effort recently tho. I dont really have any answers for you as im not quite as along the journey as you are. But you have given me something to think about thank you. I havnt done inner child work yet. Letting people back in makes us vulnerable to abandonment again and it hurts.   Reassuring your little one is a good thing and i hope the pains of missing someone lessens for you  "
797,"Thanks Sandstone. I appreciate your encouragement. I am not formally doing inner child work, and have no idea if I'm doing it ""right"".I cried myself to sleep last night. Tried to stay with my inner child and really have a conversation but she kept drifting away and eventually I was just tired enough to sleep. I kept slipping towards fantasizing and had to pull myself back into the reality of my feelings. It was very confusing.I'm wondering now if the way past these feelings of abandonment might not be just to go through all of them for each person as they happen. To allow myself to grieve as many times as I need too. It feels so much like dwelling on the pain and yet it always returns and I want so desparately to just know that the world isn't ending when I miss people and am lonely. Because many times it feels like it is.I have many facebook friends who make vulnerable posts about their struggles with anxiety, etc, and get lots of support. But I can never bring myself to do that. My struggles feel too complex, my needs too great, to simply put myself out there like that. Even though there's more awareness of depression, what we are going through is so much bigger, and I am afraid of what would change if I went public with my struggles with cptsd.My friends are great support when I see them. When I don't though, I can fall into the pit of abandonment pretty easily. I tried to keep myself busy yesterday, but my usual methods of soothing and staying healthy weren't enough to keep the emotions at bay."
798,"On Sunday I attended a wilderness conference.  This has been something my therapist and I have discussed for a long time about getting myself out there and maybe finding people with similar interest.  The day turned out to be a disaster.  First, we went as a group and when parking was difficult I joked about not having a handicap plate so we can park.  Then the coordinator said he felt that mentally ill people should have special parking, away from us.  I'm pretty sure I qualify as mentally ill.  He went on to talk about how mentally ill people use the system to get over.  Then I followed my meal plan for the day.  No less and no more.  Keeping on track has been a huge struggle lately as I am getting close to my goal weight and feel enormous.  Later when we went out for dinner he teased my about how much I eat.  Upset, I tried to defend myself, that it wasn't really that much.  Then he made fun of me defending myself.  He was teasing and is otherwise is a nice guy, poor sense of humor.On the way home I was raging.  I had all these horrible plans about what I was going to do when I walked in the door.  I didn't follow thru because my sister called with a crisis involving her grandchildren and I ended up at her house. How do you all deal with people who are ignorant and insensitive.  I was upset enough still today to ask my 19 year old something I have never asked before.  I asked her if she thought I was fat.  I know I don't see myself as other people do.  I have always been successful in not trying to put my body images on her and I failed miserably."
799,"Dealing with ignorant people, I sometimes do well and other times I don't. The days where I am ok after an encounter with one usually means I spent some time inwardly wondering if they were having an off day, or what they've experienced in their life; coupled with some mindfulness about my own imperfections. Bad days - well, let's just say I've become adept at apologies. Here's a link you may find helpful - ""resiliency building skills to practice for trauma recovery"" - http://www.new-synapse.com/aps/wordpress/?p=1825Be gentle with you. <3"
800,"I hope you don't mind me saying so, but what an   , this guy.He's in a position of authority (being the coordinator and all) and that makes it all the worse. He is  probably not ""otherwise is a nice guy"", I have a hunch he usually picks on at least one of the group he's with.On how to deal with it? First off I must say it's wonderful (of sorts) that you raged on the way home. Off course you were. Very healthy, even though rage is an unpleasant emotion. But there are times, such as this, that there's not much else you can do. The guy was deliberately pushing your buttons. First commenting on your eating, knowing you would probably defend yourself, and then attacking you on that. Premeditated, I'm sure. It's how these people operate.The mere fact that he is calling you out on ""being defensive"" is such a low blow. You were standing up for yourself! Brava! Well done!Congrats on getting close to your goal weight.   Don't let a deliberate jerk like him make you feel bad about your achievements.I think you handled this better than you give yourself credit for. "
801,"Yeah bullying.  There is at least one person like this in most organisations, unfortunately.  I suspect he picked on you because you were new and feeling vulnerable.  They have a radar for people who feel on the outside.  Trust your feelings here imo.  i know it will take courage to go back, but I hope you do and make it clear that you don't welcome his input or company, with curt politeness.This is how it starts, accepting the little things.  And they get bigger over time once he's found out who will and won't protect their boundaries.  That's my expericence.  Don't trust people who hone in on vulnerability and ""accidentally"" hit you where it hurts.  He'll be back for more if you let him."
802,"I didn't know where to put this I could see it fitting quite a few categories.I am waiting to hear from a friend if I will be moving in with her. I had hoped to have a set date by now so I could tell the bf, go stay with other friends, and ride out the interim. I had planned to tell the bf today or tomorrow since he just finished a contract and me leaving now couldn't affect his career. My doing this is impacting many lives and I hate being a burden.I had a rough ""final"" weekend with the bf which involved me comforting a grieving acquaintance. I think I did ok given the circumstances.It was extremely triggering to my F's  sudden death, and I was panicked but also detached. Maybe dissociated is a better word. Still wrapping my head around that behaviour. I would be on the brink of tears but never let myself ""go there"" for fear of making things worse, being selfish/self absorbed, being unable to control my unresolved feelings if I started accessing them. We were in public so I felt pressure to be ""acceptable"", whatever that means. And I was trying to help someone when I am so wounded myself so I doubted my ability to help.I didn't sleep well this weekend. And this emotional car wreck happened and now I'm not in the good headspace I had been in for the past couple weeks. The way bf and the bereaved's wife reacted to the situation reinforced to me that I am making the right decision for me by leaving. But also that bf might not be able to comprehend what I need or why and thatbit could be a longer and messier process than I am ready for.So today I am incredibly anxious. All these things unsaid and all this waiting on pieces out of my own control have me back to seeing in black and white, catastrophising, and feeling incredibly fearful. Not of any abuse from bf, but of all my past times of being abused or neglected, all the times I didn't speak up, each little piece of me that withered as a result. I am terrified that the longer I stay, and the longer I don't say anything, even in light of the extreme circumstances of the weekend, the more likely it is that I will lose my nerve and stay instead. All the times I gave up on myself before, and I am so afraid of failing in this way again.I have a session with my T tomorrow so will discuss. But couldn't keep this inside. I can feel it poisoning me and I believe that most of my problems stem from being unable to speak freely and being unheard or ignored. Just trying to ride out this fear. I assume ot's an emotional flashback. I hope it is only a temporary setback, and after some rest I think I will try some inner child work.If anyone has experienced something similar I would appreciate hearing about it."
803,"I can relate somewhat. Or perhaps even a lot, I don't know. My circumstances are very different.But perhaps this link may strike a chord with you, and be of aid.http://traumahealed.com/articles/stand-in-your-story/It has helped me a lot in the last couple of days. Perhaps it may help you too.   "
804,"Thank you Dutch Uncle, that does help. I haven't yet said anything today to bf and I guess I won't.  I have been hiding in bed a lot and sleeping too much. Apparently I am not ready to deal with it today given everything that happened this weekend. I still feel anxious but it's a bit more manageable.Two steps forward and one step back. Today is part of that one step back."
805,"It's wonderful the article helped, movementforthebetter, even though not everything was said yet, and possibly never will.It's a process of learning, and I have only just started myself.I think I've come to understand and feel that even if I don't say everything out loud, owning my story internally is already a big step forward.Perhaps that's even the hardest part of the process of recovery, and when we own it inside, we may find it easier to part from those who disown us of our story, and/or have done for so long.Small question regarding your first post? Is it possible for you to phone/contact this friend and tell him/her it's at the moment really important for you to know if there is a date yet? And if not if an estimate can be given when there will be a date?Perhaps when you know for certain you will not know for certain for a while might open avenues for action, or more 'peace' with waiting.  , and I hope the date will be there soon."
806,"I will have a phone call with my friend sometime tomorrow.  I am not good at waiting - anxiety really kicks in and I get pretty obsessive. When I keep busy it's less distressing but now I am home with bf full time because he's not working either. It was better when he was working at least. Each day he wants to spend with me, not knowing I have other plans. I wanted to tell him when I have dates confirmed. Same with my friends. I don't want to be an eternal houseguest. I want to have a plan that I can follow through the transition. It will be hard enough as it is.But he's clinging to me and I am silent and distant so that must be hurting him too. It can't be helped just yet."
807,"My friend came over and helped me get my air conditioners in the windows: see “Disappointing a Friend.” He said he would have to come back with some extra stuff to make the window mounts safer and asked if I would cook him a fish dinner. I asked if he would accept a vegetarian dinner instead. He said adding fish back into his diet has improved his health and mood. Am I being illogical in not wanting humans to eat animals in my kitchen, when I feed meat to my cats every day?"
808,"It's your kitchen you do what you want.I do not want people to hug me, yet I hug my kids every day.  Does that seem illogical?  Sometimes we have to get out of our head.  I'm working on that, we can rationalize everything and when we do we end up unhappy."
809,"interesting analogy, thanks. "
810,"I'm not a vegetarian, but I agree that it's your kitchen. Your cats need to eat meat to survive, whereas nothing horrible will happen to your friend if he doesn't get to eat fish in your kitchen that one time. It's not like one meal without fish is going to destroy his health and make him depressed."
811,"Thanks. Sometimes I need to ask myself ""Why am I doing this?"" I need to check I'm not stuck on auto-please mode."
812,"I think that he showed a lack of respect for your boundaries and it was rude for him to persist in asking for fish. I am a vegetarian and have fed the cat of someone I house sat for, but I wouldn't have cooked anyone a fish dinner (even in someone else's kitchen). So no, I don't think it's illogical not to want to cook fish for this guy in your vegetarian kitchen. "
813,Thanks for reminding me of the sacredness of my kitchen.
814,"Was veggie for around 10 years and now vegan for about a year and a half - you shouldn't have to make something like that in your kitchen!  Totally agree with what i've read above!  Your cat needs to eat meat - your friend doesn't need it in the same way.  It is YOUR KITCHEN!  Keep it for what you want in it.  Your friend will survive a night/day without fish/meat!!  Good luck, hope it all goes well - I know conflict can be difficult, even if you are in the right x"
815,"Hey, new member here...""Am I being illogical...""? I would say in a cheeky-friendly way that yes, there is a certain amount of logical inconsistency here but..As Caroline said, IT'S YOUR KITCHEN  If your heart says no meat, then no meat it is  I don't think that all choices need to be made logically to be valid, important, and to make sense in terms of our values. Honor Yourself, trust your heart, and don't over-extend past your boundaries unless it feels right to you to do so"
816,Thanks for that. I could choose to expand beyond the bounds of logic and what better place than in my own kitchen.
817,"Hi everyone, So, the last four times my partner and I have seen his sister and her husband, they have kept their youngest (2 YO) daughter up way past her bedtime, all the while remarking on how tired she is. She seems exhausted, and hurts to watch her basic needs be ignored.  The reason they do this, as far as I can tell, is that they don't want to leave the family event or compromise their other activities. She's their third child, and I think they don't really want to be bothered.  It's very hard to watch, for me, perhaps because of my own family background. I worry that they may be doing permanent harm to her health and sense of safety, but I don't have kids, so I don't really know. Could someone on this board who does have experience with young children comment on this, please?  Here's what we've tried to do about it so far: - My partner drops very obvious hints about how they really should be getting home so their daughter can sleep. They understand what he's getting at, but ignore it or laugh it off. - My partner's parents schedule family events as early as possible, but often, these parents ask to make them later because they have other things going on. Can other people relate? Am I over-reacting? Is there anything else I, as a non-member of the family, can do? "
818,"I don't think that you are overreacting at all, as you said they seem to be ignoring the child's basic need for sleep for selfish reasons.But at the same time I don't think that there is much you can do about it except trying to meet up with them early in the day."
819,"Thank you, Smoke! Last time we saw them was at their house...and, huzzah!...one of them actually absented themselves to put the child to bed. "
820,"If this has finally been resolved, hurray! I've had to ask my guests to leave because it was time to put my child to bed at my house. I've also brought the pack & play as a temporary crib if I know we're going to be somewhere through nap time or very late. Once or twice, while visiting with family, I hated to impose, but did ask if I could put DS then 2 down for a nap in someone's bedroom. Most people, family AND friends, are willing if they invited you knowing the small child was coming also.I agree that ignoring a sleepy child is a bad thing. Sleep is essential to a young body's growth, and there's the ignoring the child's needs for adult socialization reasons. Neither are good. Now that my son is older, DS8 will just tell me he's tired and ready to go home. If I'm not ready to leave yet, I'll suggest he lay down on GM's bed, or whatever. But, I've also learned that he'll tell me he's tired when really he's just ready to leave. I've learned to honor that. He'll tell me the real reason on the way home (my Mom has cats, his allergies can be fierce).  Now, he feels listened to and cared about and considered a priority in my life (at least on this issue)."
821,"This has been going on for a very long time, Im well past being blindsided and know the cause and effects and what to expect from my shot sympathetic nervous system. Lately my whole universe has been up-heaved again the losses weigh heaver then I think you can expect anyone to keep sanity. Two years has past, I feel maybe Im done grieving and have more of a understanding and handle on whats going on in myself then ever. My endless issue is the demands people feel entitled too..    I just wish people would not ask, I keep it all to myself, they cant relate and I get another rehash of the ""just get over it, or someone painting some kinda comparison of their or someone elses plight as if its going to what? Change whats been physically destroyed in my brain? Motivate me or something? Its not like Im whining about it, THEY are the ones that brought it up to begin with! ARGHH.. Ok so I can be slightly hostile on the subject, and that is something apparently I have no right to either. As a male weakness is intolerable, its like I cant escape the continual beatings across so many levels. Heres a short list of what life has taught me and how taboo Im starting to feel my whole exsistance has become..1. Anything that creates or brings lasting happiness to a persons life is a commodity that there is a mob of people ready to steal it all from you or punish you for having. I never had many dreams or expectations. Life is unfair and a life that I have to fight constantly is not a life Im cut out to live. I never even considered I could have a family, Iv taken the relationship card off the table all together. Its even worst I had that for a short time and a son and was very happy before it all was manipulated away, everyone wants what they want, I am discarded yet again, such is the pattern. 2. If your seen as smart people have a tendency to raise you higher or put themselves lower. The natural result of this position leads to resentment, competition, and pretenses to destroy you and enjoy your suffering guilt free by villionizing you the second you no longer serve their needs, or chafe their insecurities.I cant escape it, my entire life Im seen as the smart able guy, the person who is best qualified to ""get it done"" or who knows stuff. Sure when I put it like that it sounds like a great trait to have, its *. People want me to solve their problems for them and watch everything good in my life burn to cinders and put me in my place since they misfiled me in the first place.Iv become rather stoic, I hurt a lot, I must not hide it well enough anymore. ""Am I okay"" no but its not like I can talk about it. Its apparently ok to shove this other concept down your throat too the ""cant you just be positive and happy"" speech. Again its not like I run around complaining or catastriphizing, if you beat me up untill I have to talk to make you comfortable its going to go one of two ways, Im going to be bored and distant or anxious and shut down because your saddling me with your expectations, or I do talk and being so familiar with getting beat up with the darker aspects of human nature (which I can see as just part of the whole) and speak matter of factually is too much for people. They turn a blind eye to themselves and I tend to spell things out in a way denial wont help cover. I have nothing to say to anyone anymore, I just hurt people and all they do is hurt me. Even the fact that Im wise enough to abandon the relationship and not submit myself the the anxiety induced by someone playing with my emotions, and them getting attached to someone so ruined it will just hurt them, is unacceptable I allways get what I call the ""your just too jaded and shouldent give up on love"" speech. My exsistance is offensive, and the things people tell me is for their own benefit, they self validate their own beliefs and systems of coping with an unkind reality. And with that everything is completely taken away from me. Im thoroughly invalidated, they take my voice, my frustration, my very real daily struggle is mere whining, Im not allowed any of it. I may be even slightly passively suicidal at this point Im undone not having to look at another day of this would be a relief, given the circumstances its a reasonable feeling, BUT even that is an offense! Because most are afraid of something heading everyones way on a long enough timeline, so you get another ""speech of what I need to be true to cope"" I am comfortable in my refuge of silence, of hobbies, or books, and film, my isolation, but even then they come to drag you out into the light and stab you with their sticks until they themselves are satisfied with the unpleasantness you turn in themselfs. Just listening to these self appointed ""Fixers"" in the speeches they force on you, you can see the intimate details of the glue they use to cope, silence invites so much out of people. Im out of ideas, I dont have the energy to act. The farther I try to get away it seems the more of a draw I have, and being a cornered thing I am offensive to their natures. I am allways weary of an inner critic, its taken years of a grain of salt of self blame and observations, these effects are real and happening in those around myself, not warped perception."
822,"if staying home alone with your books and your hobbies is where it's at for you, lock the door, disconnect the bell, turn off your phone and delete your email account. I lived without a phone for 5 years. I still keep my doorbell disconnected and I rarely read more than one out of dozens of emails. Ah, peace and quiet. Don't you just love it?    "
823,"I wish it were that simple, one winter i remember I never left my house, people became concerned lol, My continued living requires some level of dealing with people regularly. And I do without complaint.. Changed up my diet a lot, lots of fatty fish, Vitaimins B-complex, magnesium citrate, drinking that Naked juice stuff, put stuff back into my system.. left to my own devices I suck at feeding myself. The Idea was to get my energy back and put some stuff back in my system to recover from the fatigue interesting side effects the magnesium must be catalyzing the vitamin D and having that antidepressant effect it has.I find myself at the store getting good conditioner and shampoo, doing laundry, motivated to take care of things and myself Iv lost interest in. just in a better frame of mind a couple days after juice binging, maybe its just a depressive state tearing me down...well roots makes this supplement I actually found one with passion flower and some other things in it I cant ever seem to find so I got that too... I need to beat this back and the inadvertent diet over haul seems to be helping a lot, which is progress I really need right now. My stupid mood seems to affect a lot more then I take for granted... I have a habit of listening to my body. People dont feel so terribly unbearable so much though Im still not talking about it rawer lol"
824,I want to go no contact with my brother.I'm done he's dead to me.How do I go no contact with him but continue to have a relationship with my enabler parents? I know he will try and get 'revenge' and want to know what plan I can put in place to reduce the backlash.Any ideas or advice from those of you that have gone no contact would be very much appreciated. Thankyou!
825,"Quote from: 89abc123 on April 29, 2016, 12:54:47 AMI want to go no contact with my brother.I'm done he's dead to me.How do I go no contact with him but continue to have a relationship with my enabler parents? I know he will try and get 'revenge' and want to know what plan I can put in place to reduce the backlash.Any ideas or advice from those of you that have gone no contact would be very much appreciated. Thankyou!First off: When he is *-bent on getting revenge, he will get his revenge. I'm sorry to say, but I speak from experience. If he is anything like my DramaSis (and he probably is a lot like her) he'll make sure he will hurt you. But then again, that's probably the reason why he's 'dead' to you in the first place.In my experience things first got worse, much worse, before they started getting better.That said, I am in much the same position as you, having gone NC with DramaSis and DramaMama and trying to keep some sort of relationship with Bro and enablerDad. (my parents are divorced)I have started my journey of LC at first with sis about 5 years ago and went NC a bit over a year ago. During this period I've read a lot on this subject, and a few sites/articles that have helped me the most are these:- When and How to Cut the Ties of Bad Family Relationships. The title says it all. You probably have went through and gone over most of what this article is about, and the most relevant quote for you at this moment is probably at the very end of the article:QuoteWhen You Decide to Sever Ties with a Family Member... [...]7: Don't pretend everything is okay. When applicable, talk to other family members about your situation. Let them know you will be avoiding contact with this person. Briefly explain why, and don't back down.- Ending a Relationship with an Abusive Parent, Child or Sibling is also an article that probably rings a bell with your experiences, and might be useful to keep at hand when the going gets tough and you ask yourself: ""OMG, I wish I had never started on going NC with bro, this is worse than it was."" Those moments probably will come... and pass.- Breaking The Curse of Family Dysfunction is another article that probably describes your experiences in your FOO, so it may be validating as well to re-read this article a couple of times to remind you why you ever started on the path of NC with bro.- 5 Solutions For Coping With Scheming Family Members as his revenge will probably take form, at some point if not already now, through scheming and/or Triangulation.- Escaping Conflict and the Karpman Drama Triangle has been a valuable article on a psychological concept called the Drama Triangle. Expect to see a lot of this, with many role-shifts, to keep everybody off-balance. Useful tips on how to cope towards the end of the article.Good luck, and since you describe your parents as enablers, expect them to NOT easily accept the new family-dynamic that will emerge over time. Basically it's only you who wants to change the present dynamic/status quo, and the others will resist any change. Bro will play an active part, your enabler parents will resist passively. Expect a lot of: ""Stop being so difficult"" from all of them.The upside? I does get better. Because you will get better. But it'll take time and effort, and there will be setbacks. "
826,"Wow thanks so much for all those resources!!I can't wait to read them all. So I saw my mum tonight, and I really just don't think I have the heart to break the news. The abusive nature of my brother is hugely minimised by her. She's like 'oh but he's going through so much right now and he had such a hard childhood and your just being a bit too harsh'. She is always making excuses for him. She's not malicious tho, she's just totally in the dark and wants to believe her son is a good person. I get really torn, like I'm letting my parents down.It even makes me second guess myself...but I just keep going back to the word 'dysfunction' and know that I really do know the truth. I've never had the heart to tell my parents about what a narcissist is and how much the bro fits the bill. I have so much respect for people like yourself who have enforced no contact. Wow. What a challenge! Good on you for standing your ground, I don't know if I'll ever get there.Just a quick question. How much healing did you do in low contact compared to no contact? Is it possible to heal a little or do you still come under fire for the changes you are making? I know nc is best but I'm trying to weigh up the best option."

Is it possible to heal a little or do you still come under fire for the changes you are making? I know nc is best but I'm trying to weigh up the best option.I did a lot of healing during my Low Contact period. In that period I learned a lot about Boundaries, Dysfunction, and a lot about the 'crazy' stuff that went on. Unfortunately, in my case, my efforts to resolve matters in a more functional way (as I was learning 'on the fly' at that time, as I think the phrase is) resulted only in increasing abusive and dysfunctional behavior from her (and my FOO's) part. Which led to me getting only further out of the FOG, realizing I was NOT making it all up.So it was a painful and hard period as well. In hindsight I would say I had better went NC immediately, but only hindsight is 20/20. Then again, both in hindsight and at the time itself, I wish(ed) my LC-period would not have resulted in NC. Alas, this was not meant to be.edited to add:Quote from: 89abc123 on April 29, 2016, 02:32:35 PMJust a quick question. How much healing did you do in low contact compared to no contact?I cannot really make the comparison, as during my Low Contact I had not even the idea that No Contact was a valid option.  So, in hindsight I only discovered I had entered Low Contact (I had been so enmeshed before that) during LC. If that makes any sense.LC pushed me in a different state of mind, and I remember well it took me weeks, if not months, to finally dare to type into Google ""How to break up with a family member"". That set the 'ball' rolling.You may well be at a different 'point' already, as you are already familiar with the concept of No Contact.QuoteWow thanks so much for all those resources!!I can't wait to read them all. Take your time. It IS a lot, and it took me many months, years even to collect them and even more so: digest them!It's a process, and the process is all different for any of us.I can relate to the dread of having to tell your mom. I dreaded having to tell my dad and bro. But once I had reached the point LC had to be turned into NC (since affairs were only getting worse), I knew I had to ""Let them know you will be avoiding contact with this person"".Bro and Dad still resist the change I have made, but now, a year later, they are slowly mellowing down.For both LC and NC I have found the last words of the second article a great support:QuoteJust remember, if you can put up with their abuse you are strong enough to distance yourself and put an end to it.Take care, and take it at your own pace. And you'll get where you feel much more comfortable than nowadays. In whatever shape or form that may turn out to be. "
828,"I had to go No Contact with all of my brothers and sisters - all six of them.  I tried to stay in contact with my nieces and nephews - but then they used them to get at me.  The text I received in May, laced with profanity, and a variety of other horrible names and accusations, yada yada, passed on through my niece, made me realize it was time to break contact with a few more.  Now out of 6 brothers and sisters, and 16 nieces and nephews - I have contact with 5.  My parents are both gone.  The crazy thing is - they have recently tried using a couple of long lost cousins to get in touch with me.  I know this was necessary - I want and need peace and sanity in my life.  But like I told my husband, it all makes me very sad.  It's just plain sad."
829,"My dearly departed Mother suffered numerous head injuries and severe damage to the prefrontal cortex. She became paranoid and irrational and was in serious need of professional medical attention. Her sister and I brought her to several different hospitals, but she discharged herself from all of them and decided I was against her, a bad daughter, a traitor, perfidious to the core. She spent her last days slandering me to everyone who would listen. Not everyone believed her. but those who did went NC with me. She is dead now but her slander lives on. It's hurtful, but on the whole I've only really lost contact with the most toxic of people, saving me the trouble of having to weed them all out. When the crap hist the fan you find out who your real friends are. "
830,"I have a bad habit about leaving places and never keeping in contact with anyone.  Most of all, I had a teacher that helped me when I left home and my dad went to prison when I was 17.  I left at 18, joined the army and never maintained any contact.  She was a reminder of a horrible time in my life.  She would email me every year on my birthday and every year I deleted it without a reply.  Sometimes I read it, other times I didn't even do that.  I tried so hard to bury the past.  Since I left home I have lived in 13 different places.  I leave and I never look back.This evening I emailed her and thanked her for all she did for me.  She put a roof over my head when I had no family.  I apologized for not being more appreciative and not keeping contact with her.  I hope she can come to understand.  And a weird thing happened....I cried.  Maybe I can feel after all.  Therapy is making me soft : )"
831,"Hmm... is therapy making you soft, or is it giving you back your missing feelings?  Good work! "
832,Soft? Or relaxed?Sounds like things are looking up 
833,"I have a problem and I'd like some feedback please. I attend a 12 step, Al Anon meeting on Tuesdays (it's for codependency). The last 4 times I've gone, I have been openly disrespected by one of the other attendees. It's mild, but I end up feeling like an outsider.My dilemma is that I'm not sure whether to say something directly to her, or go to the leader. Or, should I count this as an opportunity to just show grace to someone? I am a lot like her; I speak without thinking, I'm too direct, I'm opinionated. I'm seeing myself in the mirror and not liking being on the receiving end. Thoughts? Thanks all. "
834,"Perhaps I have better advice than I actually practice.  I would say to practice assertiveness and go directly to her.  You have the right to have your opinion given the same respect and consideration that other people's opinions are given and the right to express feelings.It reality I would struggle to say anything at all and feel really bad.  However, I know from all of my work on assertiveness what I think you should do.  I also think people have more respect and are less embarrassed if you go directly to them."

It's bothering you, so I think you do best to address it. To her directly or via the leader? What feels best for you. Possibly both. Let the leader know that you will speak up for yourself next time. The leader doesn't have to do anything beforehand, but may be able to better 'deal' with it once she has started bugging you again, and you address a specific situation. It will not come out of the blue for the leader in that case. IMHO it's better to address it when a certain behavior actually occurs than addressing it more generally. But perhaps in the moment you are too triggered?The fact you see her as a mirror of you: I can relate. But I have come to the opinion that for me to change my own behavior, it actually helps to point the same behavior out at others. How am I going to learn to stop doing something when I let others do it to me?Good luck! "
837,"Thanks, Dutch Uncle "
838,"Three  Roses you sound a lot like me too lol. Like you I am outspoken, direct, opinionated and have often been told by friends I'm a strangle anomaly as I can give direct advice but struggle when it's given back. I struggle being assertive too but here is what I might attempt. Try to think of her compassionately and of yourself compassionately, and just say that although you truly appreciate her input, you found her last remark quite difficult to deal with and could she explain a little more about what she means?This is 2 pronged, it says you are listening to her and you value her input (so being compassionate to her). It puts the spotlight back on her so everyone is now waiting for her to be nicer!If she isn't then she looks really bad and the leader may even notice this too. I learnt a long time ago that if you make it about them they will react defensively but if you make it about you they can't. This comes from assertiveness too  as in 'you keep shouting at me' as opposed to 'your shouting is making me uncomfortable'. They can't argue with how YOU feel, that's your judgement."
839,"Thanks, sweetsixty "
840,"It went well! I decided not to say anything unless it happened again. Today's reading was on detachment - I've got my stuff, you've got your stuff, and how to not let your stuff affect my stuff. Talk about timely reminders. Thanks, everyone "
841,   
842,"I'm all for practicing assertiveness. I find often what I think is a big deal is something imagined, unintentional, and not difficult to bring up. It's my inner dialogue of fighting making it a bigger deal to bring up and fear of the unknown. Just my 2 cents! But I agree it's so hard managing potential conflicts. Good luck and keep us posted!"
843,"Thanks, Healing journey   I do make things a buffer deal than necessary. "
844,"At my last group T I kept impulsively talking over people. I thought they were done, but they weren't. I wound up apologizing excessively and felt like a idiot. I think I was stuck in an EF. That was the day I fell and injured my spinal cord. I'm starting to get the feeling back in my fingers but I still have to be careful not to move my head to fast or to far or I'll experience sharp stabbing pain that goes shooting down my neck all the way to my fingertips. What a job it must be for a T or a group facilitator to maintain order over a room full or neurologically diverse participants. "
845,Three Roses - how did it go? What did you decide was YOUR best course of action? How did you feel about that afterward?  hoping it went well and that you now feel better going to these meetings.
846,"Danaus - I hope you are feeling better. Wife 2 - last week went well, all she did was shush me when I was trying to talk. I'll say something to her tomorrow if I feel the need. She's very hyper, I know she doesn't mean it, and I have a tendency to make things bigger in my head. I really appreciate everyone's feedback. If feels good to be heard.  "
847,"Had a meeting again today, and was able to discuss this issue with the group leader. I felt heard and validated. Thanks for all your support! "

850, Thanks.  
851,"Yes, Blue Knot has great resources and has done some amazing things with respect to services, raising awareness, prevention and advocacy.  Quite the organization.  I'd love for OOTS to do some similar things over time"
852,"I think I've posted this link elsewhere, but it suits this thread so I'll stick it up again. It speaks specifically to past child abuse, but a lot of the concepts likely fit other causes of cptsd.While not an extensive resource, this article was helpful to explaining to a boyfriend what was going on with me. It took a lot of nerve to send it to him, so I'm thankful that he received it well and really tried to understand. It covers a lot of ground. I can see where it would be helpful to talk it over line by line with someone who is in your inner circle of trust.http://www.dabs.uk.com/information/guidance-for-partners-of-survivors-of-childhood-abuse"
853,Thanks for this Papillon  
854,"Actually, I should probably title this feeling abandoned  and lonely.  Pete Walker talks about abandonment depression in his book ""CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" and I came face-to-face with mine again at Christmas as I posted elsewhere. My son was coming for two weeks - he goes to university across the country so we don't get to see him all that often anymore.  Before he arrived I had an EF and realized after some reflection that I was afraid to enjoy my time with him fully lest he abandon/reject me; old abandonment feelings from childhood had bubbled up.  Once I figured that out. I could then reassure myself, calm younger me directly then  let myself connect with him and have a wonderful time with him and my H.  I realized really clearly through this experience how much I have held back over the years, keeping somewhat distance from the joy of my FOC in case I were to lose them.  I know my H and S love me dearly,  but the fear of being  abandoned runs so very deep.  It's one reason I haven't wanted to connect too deeply with friends before either.  But I have worked through much of it and will keep on doing so now that I know what's going on.    Here's an exercise i found in Walker's (2013) book that relates to abandonment.Visualize yourself as time-traveling back to a place in the past when you felt especially abandoned. See your adult self taking your abandoned child onto your lap and comforting her .... ""I feel such sorrow that you were so abandoned and that you felt so alone so much of the time. I love you even more when you are stuck in this abandonment pain - especially because you had to ensure it for so long with no-one to comfort you. That shouldn't have happened to you.  It shouldn't happen to any child. Let me comfort you and hold you. You don't have to rush to get over it.  It is not your fault. You didn't cause it and you're not to blame. You don't have to do anything. Just let me hold you.  Take your time.  I love you always and care about you no matter what.""I highly recommend practicing this even if it feels inauthentic, and even if it requires a great deal of fending off your inner critic.  Keep practicing and eventually, you will have a genuine experience of feeling self-compassion for he traumatized child you were. When that occurs, you will know that your recovery work has reached a deep level (pp. 240-241)"
855,"I tried this the other day, and it worked pretty well I think. Didn't feel unauthentic at all.Weird, yes. (as in: unfamiliar) (There's probably some 'pun' hidden in the unfamiliar there. Now my thoughts are racing.  )I pictured myself in my parents-house, way back. Picked up the small boy that got so molested there, sat down, inside that house, way in the open in the living room*, and hugged and held 'him'. It felt quite physical even.I'll try to do that more. Thanks.You mentioned elsewhere (I think. Can't find it anymore. So perhaps it was somebody else who said this) that you spoke to the Inner Child as ""you (me) are safe now"" (or words to that effect). The ""you (me)"" struck a chord, as I earlier this month I 'spoke' to my Inner Child, and also referred to us as ""We"". That also allowed an 'opening up' to the ""me"" of now, as well as the ""me"" of then.We'll be making a great team.    ""Me, myself and I.""   "
856,"That was Walker who recommended doing it even if it felt inauthentic, I just forgot to bold it    Glad to hear it went well though.  I remember when I first heard about the inner child in an Adult Children of Alcoholics group and fled because it seemed so completely silly at the time.  Looking back I think what it was overwhelming and threatening.   Let younger me surface? No way, much too much pain.  It's only been in the last year that I have acknowledged my IC and accepted that she needs to be heard or she and I will continue to suffer.   I do now completely believe that it is through compassion for our younger selves that we will heal.  I didn't realize how much I invalidated her, wished she would stop being so needy, demanding and hard to deal with at the worst possible times......   until I started to acknowledge her.  Poor, poor lonely, frightened kid who needed a hug like younger you.  I did buy her a giant teddy bear which sits across from our bed and smiles at me/her every night. Ultimately I hope we will become more integrated. I do notice a younger sense of humour popping up now and then (e.g., corny jokes), a tendency to burst into song, a silliness that is spontaneous, and even a little devilish at times   so I think (hope) that is beginning to happen.  Hugs to our younger selves, they survived some really terrible things and now it's time to heal, be well and thrive  "
857,"Thank you for sharing this Kizzie, sounds like just what the doctor ordered, as I also suffer from abandonment issues   "
858,"Kizzie I just found this post of yours and what Walker recommended and TBH it bought me to tears, I certainly didn't expect that to happen. I am often in touch with my inner Children and I am aware that my husband has some traits that my dad who was my abuser had. he died when i was 18 so i never got to know why he did what he did    I didn't choose my husband though at the time i thought I had, it was my kids who made the choice, hence me been in the US.Thank you for your post  Kizzie you have given me more to think about...."
859,"I am just starting to get in touch with my IC and like kizzie I have spent so much time trying to rid myself of her without truly acknowledging her.  So thank you, kizzie, for sharing your experience & tying abandonment to that deep, soul-dragging loneliness.I have spent my life trying to find someone to take the pain of abandonment from me, yet at the same time I could not see that I was perpetuating my own abandonment against myself, again and again, by not having confident boundaries in place to protect myself from the start. It didn't matter if they were friends or lovers, I would give anything and everything to please them at first. When they failed to reciprocate I would usually pull away, feeling betrayed. Or worse, if they were a clearly healthy person, I would withdraw because I didn't feel worthy of them and didn't want to drag them down. Now I see that if they are truly healthy, I couldn't do that unless I abused them.One of my oldest friends, whom I have supported in her ongoing recovery over the years, caused a great deal of damage and triggered my abandonment severely. I thought I was over it, but find I am triggered again now that I am the one reaching to her for support. I don't think she's actually abandoning me this time though. I think it's that she's actually enforcing boundaries for herself whereas I never did even at her most destructive. So I feel abandoned, and this is precisely the time I need to focus on my IC because she sees boundaries the same as abandonment and loneliness but I as an adult know they are not. I think back to all the people I might have alienated with neediness and, well, it's a lot.Last night while going to sleep I started talking to my IC to try and quiet my anxiety. ""I am here for you. I love you. I am here for us. I love us. I am here for me, I love myself."" It definitely felt unnatural but it also worked to quiet my racing bedtime thoughts. This morning I tried saying the Pete Walker excercise and it felt less unnatural. I also cried, so there is something to it. There is pain waiting to be released. I'm getting a little closer every day, even days like yesterday, which was messed up from lack of sleep and self-care challenges. I was still there for myself at bedtime. I am working towards being there for myself full-time."
860,"I think I am ready to be the parent I by the Grace of God and hard work I was to our children.  I guess it started with fake it till you make it.  I had no idea what I was getting into when I had them but took each moment and opened my heart to them.  Twenty plus years later they have taught me others can be safe if I choose wisely and have healthy boundaries.  For the first time in my life, I want friends and a community.  Thanks for sharing everyone!Thumper  "
861,"Just by way of an update, I was recently at my son's grad as I wrote about in a few other posts and saw my cNPDM for the first time in two years.  I did not have an EF I think because I chose not to abandon myself (Walker talks about being abandoned by others and ourselves), because I let go and connected with my S at Christmas and enjoyed it so much, I just let myself do the same thing again and it calmed any anxiety at being around my cNPDM.  What I mean is that I chose to open up to being excited and proud and happy rather than abandon that part of me and retreat into fear of my cNPDM as I have done far too many times in the past.  And that has reinforced for me how important attending to my needs and wants is, that it is something of a balm or antidote for being abandoned in childhood.  I'm not saying that sense of abandonment has gone entirely, I don't think it ever will as it is a part of my history.  I just feel like I am not running away from it as hard, that it is more a part of me, as though I am integrating it rather than separating it into a dark corner and somehow that brings it's power down to manageable level.  Sometimes it's hard to capture these inner workings in words lol, hopefully this resonates. I think a good question to ask myself before I go to bed every night now is ""Have I hugged my Inner Child today?"" and if not give her one great big    "

871,"Tonight I feel lonely. It's one of those nights when I wish I was out having fun with friends. I live alone and I have no friends. I've only been in this city for 1 year and a half, and I know no one. On the nights when I feel lonely, I drink whiskey because it reminds me of good times when I felt safe. I miss those times very much, even if they were few and far between in my life. I like how quiet my apartment is, but on some nights, the silence can feel deafening. On some nights, I'd like to hear some noise, I'd like to feel connected to the world around me, to have fun with people and let go of my anxiety, my fears and worries. But when I'm around people, it's hard not to feel that hollow silence inside of me, that empty feeling that I try so hard to fill.Tonight,  I'm wearing a green dress and heels, I've got lipstick on, and I've sitting alone drinking whiskey. Tonight, I'm wondering how my life ended up like this and why I seem to always be alone. Tonight, I feel hollow and empty, and I'm trying to fill that void with whiskey. I'm sorry for the depressing post. Thanks for reading!"

877,"I don't know where I should post this or if this matters at all, but I'm facing a dilemma and I don't know what I should do. I am taking some summer classes at my university and it's been rather hard to deal with my panic attacks and follow my courses. This one particular course, although really interesting, demands a lot of work (a lot of papers, etc.) I've had problems and anxiety with writing academic papers due to some of my FOO's abuse (I come from a strict family of academics) and have talked about it a bit with my T. I feel that I took on too much of a work load by signing up to this class, and I don't know if I should drop out or not (there can be no refund at this point, but I have no academic penalties if I withdraw from the class). It also seems that the professor triggers me, and I've had to leave the class a couple of times because of panic attacks. I don't know if this is a stupid subject, but what should I do? Should I withdraw from the class or should I continue it?  Feeling a bit overwhelmed... I'm sorry if this post seems whiny  "
878,"Hi LanaBanana,I don't have an advise for you. I can only say that it's often a hard call to drop something. But there is no shame in quitting. In Dutch we have a saying ""Better turned around halfway than get lost all the way."" But I know from personal experience how hard it can be to turn around half-way and back up on your track.I would take out the ""no refund"" from the equation. In matters like this money should not be of much concern. You are considering your wellbeing in this course, and probably thats the only thing you should decide your decision on.Good luck contemplating what feels best. I don't know how pressed you are for time in this, but sometimes it can help to make a personal private trial-decision and sit with that for a day or two. If you feel good with the trial-decision you still have the option to make it final or spend a day or to trying the other option and then decide. "
879,"Thank you Dutch Uncle!    My FOO often held financial matters over my head and made me feel like a burden for taking up all their money. I think I still feel like this and I am very much terrified of wasting money  Thank you for your kind words, it's very much appreciated.  "

884,"Three Roses, because it's a spring-summer session, the class is a lot shorter and more condensed. I don't think there are any other options available, as the class is ending very soon (it was only a couple of weeks long due to the short session). I know that, given my schedule, I can always take up another class to fill that requirement. Thank you for the advice!  "
885,"Personally im stubborn, I fall apart, this destroys me, is become a bit of a way of life.I refuse to fall back if I can help it, I want to change the name of Facebook to Streesor but I dont delete people that trigger me and I deal with the horrible flashback inducing memories app you cant escape from. I take all the horrible and try not to hide, nurture avoidance, I treat every episode as an opportunity to try without expecting myself to make it through, if I fall then I am what I am because like for me is something pointless to escape from.The down side of the down side is feeling like * starts to become not worth the efforts. The upside is I find myself more resilient even if absent, conditioning myself to carry on to spite of feeling lie im coming unglued.I think it only is working though because I dont force myself I give it a go and allow myself room to fail because to me not letting myself try is the worst failure, and Im going to feel sick over it all either way.In your case I cant even imagine trying to write papers in that foggy haze following a panic though, Im sorry that really is awful      "

I know what's theirs is theirs and what's mine is mine... but perhaps that is when I am easily able to remove myself from a situation.Before going NC with my NPDmom, and before all the lightbulb moments and coming so far in my own self-education and self-care, I had a lot more resistance and defenses in place for dealing with angry, morose, self-centered people.  I felt like absorbing or deflecting a constant barrage of negativity and stress was just part and parcel of being around other people, particularly family because, you know, you can just be yourself around family (i.e. lazier and less accountable for your emotional footprint).  People are stressed, people don't deal well with their stress, people can't be expected to take care of themselves, people aren't responsible for their own emotional health, people aren't responsible for the emotions they put into a room, there aren't ways to take that responsibility, people hoist their negative emotions onto the people around them - these were truths so real that they weren't even examined, they were just the wallpaper and the furniture in the room that you don't even see any more you've been living with them for so long.Now that I know none of that is true, and can see the lack of health in it, I'm finding it incredibly difficult to be around people who are aren't taking care of themselves and are letting their lack of emotional health come out in their tone of voice, like toxic fumes in the air everyone else is forced to breathe.  My cousin, specifically - her stress level is very high, I suspect she has rage issues, and it's always boiling just below or at the surface.  (I'm out of the country right now, one week into a three week visit to my cousin and her two young kids, one of whom is very special needs - here helping her move, basically doing the work of a live-in nanny + mover/organizer, which I don't mind, she needs the help... it's just been a challenge because I've been in a c-ptsd recovery depression haze for about three months so jumping head-on into this has required a lot of mental upkeep and self-care...which my cousin is basically unaware of.)More than half of what she says is in a high pitched, raised voice, ranging from emphatic to outright screaming, in an angry tone, worded in a way that expresses outraged incredulity at the person's behavior or just the simple state of things - a sort of mocking, criticizing, exasperated tone is the default.  She goes from zero to I'VE EFFING HAD ENOUGH in the space of one sentence.  I truly don't think she's aware that that's what she sounds like, or that she'd give any thought to the effect it might have on anyone else - 'you don't know what my life is like' would be the response.  It's not that she doesn't have reasons to be stressed, it's that she ... well, sadly, as she opened up to me one night, she just wishes someone would come in and save her from her life.  She has no interest or knowledge in learning about emotional health - the second a suggestion is made, she's stopped listening and is making ""But you don't understand"" excuses.  She just can't hear it.  I don't think she's got a PD!  I think that life has dealt her a really difficult hand and that she's been a nervous person her whole life to begin with, and her mom wasn't - isn't - the 'tell me how you're feeling' sympathetic listener type, so I think my cousin sort of, simplistically put, feels the need to be loud so that maybe someone will make her feel heard.  She does deal with the demands of her life fairly well on the surface, getting things done, it's just the emotional run-off that is noxious to be around.This isn't really about her, though - it's about being my being around her all the time (which I have to be, living with her for the next two weeks), and how it is soooo much harder for me.  Used to be, I could handle it with all the old emotional forcefields I've developed since childhood - my cousin is basically a sweet person who means very well, unlike my mother, and has actual real life problems she is having to deal with every day, unlike my mother who fostered her own misery and the misery of others, so comparatively dealing with my cousin was a walk in the park.  But now I am having a really hard time being around the CONSTANT negativity and anxiety - she doesn't seem to understand that it is not my job to sooth her anxiety - of course I listen and behave in an appropriate sympathetic way, but sometimes I'm not able to be present and her anxiety amps up and up and up when someone isn't there to come to her rescue - I think being around someone who has and can enact boundaries is a whole new thing for her.  I have only been around her for a week and I am finding myself avoiding her in the apartment, and being reluctant to express any emotion around her at all.  Trying to have a conversation with her about 'the way she talks' would not go over well, she's just too hyper-sensitive to criticism (she's doing the best she can!!!) to hear that it's not me judging HER, it's me asking for something I need.So this is a new stage in my recovery journey.  The old tricks aren't working - I no longer feel comfortable around unhealthy behavior - I need clean air.  I can recognize that her behavior is a result of her stress, her life, her habits and I don't take it personally, so that's good; I am emotionally detached enough that I don't feel like I need her to recognize my feelings because her behavior isn't hurting me, so much as it is making me uncomfortable to be in her presence.  Maybe this is a time when I need to stick up for myself more?  Because I'm living with her for another two weeks and so... I'm gonna be in her presence and that's a long time to be uncomfortable.  But I really don't think saying 'hey can you stop sounding so angry every time you open your mouth' even in a really 'this is about me not you' way will do anyone any good.  Maybe I just need to buckle down grit my teeth make nice get through the two weeks.  :/  This is part of the 'figuring out what's normal and healthy' without a role model bit, I suppose...She talks that way to her kids all the time too, and it makes me wince.  We teach our kids how to respond to stress and I see how her kids are learning from her and it makes me think of me and my mom... yowee.   "
888,"Sorry for the novel, thanks for reading if you got all the way through it!    "
889,"Seasaw - Your story spoke volumes to me.  And you are so articulate and able to be mindful. You are able to observe yourself feeling these feelings your cousin provokes inside of you. That's huge!  Really awesome.  What a long way you have come.I don't have much advice, being on the road of learning myself, but my experience with people like this is that there isn't really anything you can do. They make choices.  Everybody in the world, no matter how rich or how poor, has difficulties and hard things to overcome. But how you choose to do it, is a defining character moment.  Your cousin is totally unaware of your struggles correct?  But you too have faced the adversity of having CPTD head on and have chosen  to handle it with grace. Your cousin has the same choice in her own adversity.I do disagree that your cousin does not know what she is doing when she goes from 0 to 60 in one sentence.  She is trying to make somebody take on and share the responsibility for her life. She is trying to guilt or manipulate somebody into taking up the slack. And I am sorry if this is offensive but your cousin does not sound like a healthy, or mature  person  who is good for you to be around or have in your life. She's admitted that you, that she wants somebody to take over.  Believe her.I've lived with somebody like this, a roommate recently and I have no answers.  We parted ways, I said ""you're triggering me I can't live like this, it's time for you to find your own place.""  I would spend my whole evening coming up with solutions to her problems.  She would spend her whole evening arguing why none of my solutions would work. And I am a positive creative person.  Finally I just had to say to myself about her, ""Fine if you want to be unhappy and miserable, then go do it with my blessing.  But not here.""As for your cousin, maybe just set come boundaries with her.  Tell her you understand her life is hard. But outline what you personally are able to do and not able to do and that is all you can do. And that her behavior is making you doubt that you can fulfill what you committed to do for her. The two more weeks. Tell her how you feel when she screams and is angry.  Tell her that you want to help her as best you can, but most of what's wrong?  You can't help with and don't have a solution for.  Suggest counseling for her, or family therapy. Tell her you are not qualified. Tell you nderstand life is tough,  but her behavior is causing you to doubt you can finish the next 2 weeks. Because it is upsetting you to be around it and listen to it.I don't know. And you don't really have enough time to do what I did, but when I laid down the law with my roommate? She escalated her behavior for about 2 weeks and after I held firm?  She changed.  And started really trying to stop drinking so much around me and went to her room when she wanted to trip out on pills and booze combined.But rest assured your cousin is trying to manipulate you.  If only to get some relief from the demons in her own head.  Don't accept it.  It is not your responsibility. I know that wasn't very helpful but I am in baby steps myself with recovery.  But I know I must set boundaries and I am equally entitled to the air in the room. "
890,"In my experience what VF makes, and yes it's normal that these things bother you more now.  In the past they likely did at some point, as a child maybe, but you had to suppress your feelings.  Hence the C-PTSD.  I think that what's bothering you, the irritated tone, yelling, anger would bother any healthy person.Although you care for your cousin and her children ultimately it's your choice too about prioritizing yourself.  Whatever that looks like under the circumstances.  Maybe you leave her at home to brood and you focus on the children, taking them places, find coffee shop(s) for yourself.  Use the bathroom and it's lock if you can.  Whatever it takes to care for yourself as well in this situation.  Your needs are important too.  And if you've had some positive history maybe appealing to her in that way?  Something like you're having a difficult year and are healing and need time away from the apartment some, some fun outings w/the kids, baths, whatever and see how she responds.  If there's no empathy from her, then you may need to remove yourself of suffer through the experience knowing that you won't do so again.  And if there is some empathy build from there.  Sometimes people don't know our boundaries because we don't state what they are, so maybe give her the opportunity to respond too.  You might already have done so, I don't know.  If she lacks empathy for your situation that says a lot too.  If that's the case you probably didn't notice in the past b/c that was your ""normal.""I doubt that she'll change her verbal behavior completely, but maybe a heart to heart about you seeing how stressed and angry she is and encouraging therapy might be what she needs to hear from you.Posting here for perspectives to get you through the next couple of weeks should help.  You've got support here.  And really from what you describe her behavior is not ok, no healthy.  No excuses."
891,"Today I came across an advise (again) that has helped me enormously in the past years to detach me from many toxic relationships I was in. It's still a struggle for me to stay out and/or not to start new ones. So if only for a reminder to myself I post this here, yet I do hope others may find these five tips useful:How to Deal with Emotional Manipulators1. Dont negotiate with them. For emotional manipulators, its all about having, exerting and gaining more power. So theyll always push for more and theyll never compromise.2. Dont engage with them. Dont try to talk, or reason, or discuss some matter with them - as theyll try to twist your motives, and leave you feeling bad.3. Dont confront them. Theyre quick to take offense and they love an argument. Theyll then turn and attack you  and never let things go.4. Know your own personal buttons. Theyll aim to press your buttons to get a strong reaction. But knowing yourself well means you have the upper hand. Plan how to not react and to stay detached and calm.5. Refuse to accept help as theyll treat you like you owe them. Youll then be in their debt  so its hard to feel youre free.For me personally #5 has been key. I think this is what is also called: 'resisting the Hoover'.    Rather than posting a separate thread I looked for one that seemed fitting.I hadn't read this thread before, but I think it's worthwhile a resurrection. Thanks, all who started this thread and shared their experiences.   "
892,"How To Deal With Emotional Manipulators - What a terrific list! so succinct but there is so much to it. Thank you for posting this DU. Such a helpful reminder. I do need reminders when meeting new people & trying to build healthy relationships from scratch.For me #4 is key. One of my major buttons is passive aggression. It so often seems like someone isn't doing anything at all & I'm just being unreasonable, over-reacting or jumping to conclusions. That's the tricky thing for me about PA, it's invisible! For sure the best thing is to 'not react', and boy can that be tricky, to not confront, engage or negotiate. I find when I feel the strong compulsion to do those things it really helps to use distraction techniques so that my mind can stop fixating on the compulsion. Some guided meditations on detaching from thoughts can be helpful too.  "
893,"Dear Dutch Uncle,  I find I must complement your turn of fraise again, except I really don't get it this time. Please explain 'resisting the Hoover' to me.  "
894,"Danaus,I'll try to explain.What I have come to learn (or better said, am in the process of learning) is that my emotional abusers also offer help. Then they are kind and understanding. Only to be followed by another betrayal, trick, put-down etc. And then offering some help again, rinse and repeat. This process is referred to as Hoovering.So, not accepting help from them, however attractive that help may seem, is""'resisting the Hoover""."
895,"Celebrate Creative Maladjustment & Neurodiversity.David McCarthy head of Mad Pride Ireland said We show the world that madness is an everyday occurrence that affects us all and can be dealt with openly, lovingly and without fear. https://youtu.be/fv3LoU5ovbI This Is To Mother You -by Sinead O'ConnorThis is to mother youTo comfort you and get you throughThrough when your nights are lonelyThrough when your dreams are only blueThis is to mother youThis is to be with youTo hold you and to kiss you tooFor when you need me I will doWhat your own mother didn't doWhich is to mother youAll the pain that you have knownAll the violence in your soulAll the wrong things you have doneI will take from you when I comeAll mistakes made in distressAll your unhappinessI will take away with my kiss, yesI will give you tendernessFor child I am so glad I've found youAlthough my arms have always been around youSweet bird although you did not see meI saw youAnd I'm here to mother youTo comfort you and get you throughThrough when your nights are lonelyThrough when your dreams are only blueThis is to mother you"
896,"Listened to the song and I'm weeping. Thank you, Danaus.  Mad Pride"
897,"Today I had a fuller reaction to the memory of my BPDm coming in my room to be emotionally abusive (either criticizing me or wanting me to comfort her).  She used to say, ""Knock, knock, knock!"" in this cutesy ""I'm just pretending to knock because we're so close we don't have boundaries"" voice or say my name with this annoying ""I need you to do something for me"" inflection to it -- it still makes me cringe to think of it.  Even though I spent a lot of time alone, I couldn't truly get away from her.  I had the physical ability to lock my door but I knew that I had to let her in any time she wanted to talk to me.  And it's like I can't ever be alone enough or be far enough away from her.Being alone is the only time I feel safe to be myself.  I spend a lot of time alone and rarely feel lonely; I think I suppress feelings of loneliness so that it's hard to recognize.  When I'm around other people, my mind tends to go blank and I semi-freeze.  (I don't think I'm hypervigilant, but maybe this is my version of dissociating rather than being vigilant?  Does anyone else do this?) If I'm talking with someone (especially party/large group conversations or on the phone) I tend to wait for them to dismiss me when they're done talking to me, as if they're BPDm."
898,I enjoy being alone. My h travels for his job and although there are times when I wish he didn't travel so much if he is home for an extended amount of time I will find myself wishing he would go out for a few days. We both need our alone time and we've had the conversation that I don't think either one of us could handle a traditional marriage of together every evening every day. I miss him when he's out but I think it makes our time together better.When I am with people I sometimes have blank outs where I can't think of a single thing to say. It's kind of like a mental freeze. It's gotten better since Ive learned about mental health but I still notice it particularly in larger social settings. I think it's the nature of the beast known as cptsd.
899,"Yes, that was the worst: never truly being alone. I could close my door, but if I locked it, my mother would demand an explanation. She'd knock before entering, but only once, and so abrupt and loud it often made me jump. She'd barge right in. She was so hideously overworked, she had literally no patience left, no gentleness, no time for chit-chats, so she'd stride in, look down on me, face grim and serious: ""Homework done yet? Your room's a mess, tidy it up! Where's that pair of jeans I told you I had to darn?"" There were no boundaries, or none that applied to her. Everything was under her control; everything was open to her interrogation. I remember wishing I could just hide between my desk and the wall. The only reason why I didn't was, she'd have certainly hunted me down. She expected me to find me at my post. Making her look for me would have been a crime.Does that mean my CPTSD now wouldn't be so very bad if only I'd have been allowed to lock the bloody door?    Rain, I like this concept of emotional safety. I never thought of it like that, but that's precisely what was lacking. It's what's still lacking. I'm hyper-vigilant in social situations. The first itty-bitty thing goes wrong and that's it, the situation's officially become unsafe. Being alone means being safe. Once there are no people around, then there is no danger around. I can be around people, but it takes energy. We had visitors just yesterday, and I'm still sad and frustrated by how easy it still is for me to get EFs. "
900,"There actually ARE people out there capable of LOVING us, and looking at us with caring ...honoring our boundaries.   And, we hide from them too.....    "
901,"Yes, I knew that traumatic memories cause PTSD or CPTSD especially and particularly when they're associated with a lack of control. But it's still another thing to connect this to my own life. It's still so easy to think that it wasn't bad. After all, I was never hit. My mother was hard, that's true. I think she lived all those years as if we were having one long emergency, where it's quite alright to focus only on the most important tasks. It's a pity. She's a good woman. She just can't like me, I think. Love in an abstract sense, yes. If our house ever burnt down, she'd be here in a heartbeat to help. But liking, not so much.A big eye-opener was reading in Pete Walker's texts how emotional abuse and neglect also means there's no one there to share good news with, no one who welcomes us, no one we can go to if we want to chat about things that interest us. I never realized before how much I'd missed that as a kid. It's still something I routinely keep to myself. I started purposely sharing some of the sillier, more inconsequential bits of ""good news"" or things of interest with dh. And what do you know, it does help bring you closer to someone. I never knew.   I'd thought I was doing him a favour by keeping it to myself. It's given me a new appreciation for the fact that dd loves to share Star Wars trivia with me. I have no interest whatsoever in Star Wars, but I have an interest in her, so I'm listening a lot more actively now, asking her questions about it etc. And hey, it's brought us closer together too! Amazing, isn't it, this thing called ""relationship"" that apparently I didn't get in my FOO."
902,"By chance, do you have German, Scandinavian heritage, cat?"
903,"Oooh yes, plenty of Germanic heritage, and therefore plenty of stoicism and emotional constipation. I'm in Central Europe, near the part where cuckoo clocks come from. (There are all kinds of novelty clocks invented in that area about... one or two centuries ago?... One where, on the stroke of the clock, a tiny figurine beheads another tiny figurine - but for some reason those never really caught on.) I agree about the 4F defense. Sometimes I'm wondering if whole cultures can go into a 4F defence. It's probably safe to say that some cultures or subcultures value one of those coping styles above the others. "
904,"No boundaries, no knocks, no locks --- that sums it up for me. Worst memory regarding this problem: When I was doing my A levels, my parents were pre divorce (father overt NPD, mother covert NPD and VERY passive aggressive) and both used me as their confidante. My father was absent from the house as often as he could - and so the b@$tard would come into my room and wake me up at night to talk about his problems - sometimes stark naked!   YIKES!!!!!! (I was never sexually molested by anyone but this was horrific for me as a teenager and he kept doing it even when I asked him not to).The first time I ever enjoyed being alone and literally just revelled in 'the sound of silence' was when my DD started pre school. I had made a million plans of what I would do while she was gone - and all I did was sit in my living room, on the couch, and ENJOY the silence... I think it was the first time in my life I was ever consciously 'alone' - in my head as well as physically. Pure bliss! Nowadays, I enjoy company as well as alone time. Both are necessary to my emotional and physical wellbeing.

I think my mother might have been subjected to passive agressiveness by her own mother but there was never any physical violence (I checked and checked with various sources in an effort to understand). My father had a brief stint with his birth father when no one knows for sure whether or not verbal or physical abuse occured but apart from that certainly nothing. (The divorce laws were quite complicated at the time and my father seems to have spent a few months living with his father before my grandmother could arrange for having sole custody of both her children.) Quite the contrary: He seems to have used and abused his mother as well as her twin sister even as a teenager/young adult (the stories start when he was 17).Whatever their own childhoods were like or not like: It can only ever be an explanation, never an excuse for the way they (mis)treated us.Quote from: Rain on September 29, 2014, 10:58:05 PMBut, it stops with you ...That's it!

907,"FMV -My mother also did the verbal knock while simultaneously opening the door. I thought nothing of it until I read your post.  really she had me that brainwashed. See she went on and on about how she was a great mother because she allowed me to have my door closed, she didn't even have a bedroom door, she said. I discounted how I felt about her barging in, because she over-layed those feelings with her 'you're supposed to be grateful' feelings. Wow. Just wow.I too love being alone. I've asked my T about this several times, thinking that it might be wrong. She assures me, that as long as I'm happy to be alone, there is nothing wrong with it.I remember the best times growing up were when I was a teenager, and my parents would finally leave me alone in the house. It's like the whole house exhaled when I surreptitiously watched their car leave though a slit in the curtains (to make sure they really were gone). Then when I heard the car engine on the street, as it slowed to pull into the driveway, all the anxiety came flooding back in.It's hard to describe what happens to me with groups of people. It's kind of like tunnel vision, but it applies to all my senses. I am hyper aware of my immediate surrounds, but a cyclone could be happening in the next room, and I might not notice. My mind slows down and speeds up at the same time. I can take in tons of clues in my immediate surroundings, but verbal ability is greatly reduced. I think this is what Peter Levine describes as freeze. He says when the amygdala activity goes up, the activity in the Broca(language center) of the brain goes down."

There was definitely a line crossed, and it was crossed twice over after you asked him to stop. Nakedness plus emotional incest - I can't even imagine how hideously unsettling that must have been. Honestly, with all our stories here... developping a taste for alone-ness was probably simply good sense. A proof that some of our self-care instincts were alive and well. It's probably rather thin, as far as silver linings go, but still. Here's to us!  "
909,"I just want to say thank you to all of you, I look forward to alone time and crave it but then once I have it ... I'm lost and kinda down. It's no good when you have a family because you save certain chores for these days but chores trigger me because ... Well you all may know what a bpd mother does if your chores aren't done "" the right way "" . Emotional abuse does things to a person, I now see that I'm highly suggestible easp. When I'm dissociated. Pete talks about inner critic induced flashbacks and I myself call them "" shame "" attacks. It's like a panic attack but with hopelessness vrs a racing heart.

I just got an awesome bit of info, I love in a heavily PA Dutch place so that's German and something else, I just was in a class for work and they talked about how our little town is very much it's own little world. Shame based culture, very private, go to work and work hard, stick close to the family, don't laugh at yourself, keep your head down, don't be special or stick out...etc. just a lot of inferiority and narrcessit deffensiveness, religious bigotry. You make it we got it lol Well I found out that pa Dutch originated in a very small town outside of Germany, a town that got wrecked often due to being small with no allies. Apperently in that town if someone came walking through and they where of a different race or looked taller or more muscular just if they where clearly not from around.... Chances are they had an army with them ready to pillage and attack. Really no relevance but I gleaned some insight from it and thought it really painted a picture of all the enmeshment and shame I see in my little towns culture.

He didn't offer more nights there)2 other friends kindly let me stay at theirs, and i rang the women refuge centre and they told me they couldn't do anything for me until monday.It is Monday today, so I rang back and left a message as their lines were busy.  Im still waiting for them to return my call.I didn't know if going to a shelter was the best thing.i was unsure of weather i was being silly not to go back to that house.I was wondering if i felt unsafe due to reasons that are more about my past, and i was wondering if anyone else who was enduring psychological abuse from partner with Narcissistic traits would freak out as much as i did, even if they didn't have the past i have had.I don't know if this is narc abuse from FOO and him, but i cant tell what is what and never have been able to, and i have not trusted my own perceptions for so long, so like a child, i don't know what to do.T said she will ring me in the morning as she was busy all of Friday.I am not sleeping well. Taking me ages to get to sleep, mind buzzing etc. too adrnalised to sleep, and so i finally go to sleep, but accidentally slept through her call that morning.I text her to explain what happened.She hasn't replied to my text- but i can see that she has read it because it says *read* at the bottom.I don't know what the rules are regarding boundaries with therapists and clients.I feel like I've just *missed my chance* and  I know she isn't a *friend* who can say, ok we all make mistakes, i understand, ill call u back when i have a moment.Its her job. I was just wondering if you guys know what the deal with this might be- regarding her not responding to my message explaining why i missed her call, and that I'm sorry.I thought that at least a text saying weather she could call or couldn't would be the right thing to do, as i got back to her- i know it might look to her like I'm not that bothered about the call, but i don't think my voice message or the text (that i wasn't sure sent due to area till later) conveyed anything but being really bothered.Maybe I'm a little paranoid that I'm attracting others who are narcy, or who don't really care and i don't want it to continue.I just want to know if you guys think there is something *iffy* with her not replying to my text.Thanks for any help or input- most appreciated.

Never mind if it's FOO-stuff, his narc stuff or a mix. You acted to protect yourself from hurt or harm.  Excellent you are now looking for alternatives, and the shelter is a fine one.Call them every hour. Leave a message every time the lines are busy. The are a shelter for people in distress like you are now. They can handle you're repetitive calling.  Regarding your therapist:She might have clients around and scheduled calling you later.From personal experience I know how annoying something like this can be. I've also felt 'held at bay' by my psychologists at some point, she had to cancel an appointment, but as it turned out she had complications with her pregnancy. It still came at a very inconvenient time for me too!   (I kept my cool though   . That did take an effort   )Keep trying, and if one of the two eventually works out today, I hope you can feel good about that. Even if no solution will be reached today, you did your best, which is something you can take credit for.Wishing you the best of luck.  "
914,"Hey Dutch,thank you so much for your validation, and for letting me know that you don't think I'm being silly.I never even thought about this, so thank you. You acted to protect yourself from hurt or harm.  Thank you for measuring me that calling lots for the Shelter is fine.Your right, it is annoying and also at an inconvenient time. Its great that you understand how that feels - but not for you if you know what i mean.Im sorry that happened to you too. It drills home the fact, (even though i don't call a lot at all - never called her)..that they are your *therapist*, and that they cant care in the way that you want them too, in the way that you need them too.Its annoying because i really needed to talk to her...and I won't be seeing her this week cos its her week off. Im not hopeful that she will call back- i just have a feeling that she won't.You talking about her pregnancy complications, does make me think as i have been trying to bear in mind, that maybe there is a good reason why.Im really not sure i could caller or text her again.Well done for keeping your cool.Thanks a lot for wishing me luck Dutch. You are so supportive and it means the world to not feel alone and unsupported.  "
915,"Hey guys, I hope this isn't too weird, but i just wanted to share a really positive experience i had today, and i think, that maybe, it might provide some hope for those of you that need it, who wish to attract healthier individuals into your existence, or at least, individuals who are not *only* about themselves, who actually *see* you and who treat you the way you deserve to be treated. A little backstory..Because of my parents...i got CPTSD, and part of the CPTSD for me, like many others, involves attracting subsciously to you, others that mirror your parents, / caregivers / the people that initially hurt you.I have always had self absorbed friends.I have just come out of a relationship with a man who has narcissistic traits, who hurt me a lot.Sure i hurt him too, and i take full responsibility for that. We were not good for each other, and i changed a lot of my behavior, the only thing i couldn't change was opening up and doing the whole intimacy thing (counter dependent).But he can not see his faults no matter how sensitively i put it, no matter if I'm blunt.I attracted a woman who has undiagnosed NPD, just like my mother.None of these relationships worked out, some ended because they ended them, and some ended, because i ended them.I have wanted for so long, especially since this relationship with partner breaking up, to attract good people. i know i have to work on myself for it to work, and i wish for that too. it will happen one day.Only, i think that it might be happening now.Since the break up, people that i have always really liked, have been so supportive, with out me even having to ask or tell them or be open.One particular person..i went for lunch with her today.I noticed right away, that the conversation was equal. Im a listener to others, but she didn't take advantage of that, and talk none stop.She didn't talk over me, if i spoke, she didn't interrupt me.She listened to me when i spoke.Apart from my T, this is a first,and with T, its about me, and she has to keep telling me that, because i feel so guilty for talking and her just listening.With this person, it was equal, and I'm not used to that.She took interest, she asked questions,She seemed to care, and she demonstrated that.She was empathetic, validating, perceptive, understanding.I felt seen and heard by her.She seems like me, - as they say- people are mirrors that you look into to see yourself.So i would never use her kindness or lean on her to much. and if she is too much of a giver, thats an issue for her, but the conversation did feel healthy, and i care enough that i would never exploit her ...codependant? ways.She is aware of her way of being too..to a degree.She shared some of her story, with the undiagnosed NPD X, so she understood about my situation, and how it looks like he is a great person on the outside.She believed me- because of her own experience and she didn't judge.I felt less alientated, and alone, and i NEVER though id experience that, apart from with T and on here.I know i want to shout the truth from the rooftops-but i didn't do that.I know that its not my job to get others to understand what happened / what is happening.Because maybe i have a wound there, because my dad never stood up to my mother or protected me from her.The things i guessed about this person all along, were true.Another indicator that i need to trust myself, my perceptions and my feelings. T tells me that all the time.I don't need her to be a mother to me, i don't need to lean on her for emotional support, (i need support) but i don't like her *for that reason only* and i don't need her just because I'm lonely.I always liked her, just didn't know her very well, and it would be great to get to know her. Thats why its so great that it was her that stepped forward, I'm extremely lucky.I really care about her, but i won't try to fix her.It would be so great if we did have a friendship, because i have a feeling, that it would be equal.A little bit of my real self appeared and i think she saw me in a different light.I told her a little of what i knew, after her telling me a bit about her childhood, and the relationships she had been in since then, and i empathized totally, and she was open to hearing what i had to say.i always envisioned myself being like the narcissist lady, helping others, sitting on the computer or in a cafe with someone like me, telling them what i knew, only now i know that its fine to help, if people want help, you can't just go around trying to fix people.i really looked up to her, and thought she had healed, and ignored the niggling doubt i had in my mind that she wasn't, until everything ended and i saw the devastating truth.After she left, i couldn't see a future *me* anymore.Only now, i sometimes feel like i am like her, only in a healthier way that she was (I'm getting there)I had to let go of that false image i had of her being healthy, and me being like her in my future.But perhaps those two images of me being like her, but also being healthy and like myself, whatever that is, have blended, and maybe i am on my way to becoming that.Going for a meal, and her driving me home, was like when i used to spend time with the narcissist lady. I still really miss her for sure, but i am numb to those feelings that i never grieved.There is grief for me, about the fact that, what she said- some of the things = was right, and now that i am seeing that there was truth in what she said, she isn't here anymore of me to tell her that.and its dad that she abandoned me, because i know she didi t because she was scared.And all the illusions and dysfunctional behavior of hers, isn't HER, it was a defense against pain, and her head had been messed up by her abusers - not her fault.Its sad that i had to not contact her again, cos i couldn't be in a realtiohshiop wither her as it was hurting me, and she would just repeat the same things she already did for sure.If it didn't hurt so much, i wouldn't mind seeing her again. But out of self respect- weather it hurts you or not, you have to say *not ever again*.(i know its not always possible to go no contact)Today was in a way, sort of like a repeat of the past i had with the narcissist lady, only it seemed healthier, and I felt no pressure to be someone i was not.I felt really overwhelmed since i got back. its a lot to take in, but in a good way.Im not pinning any hopes on this person to fix me- nothing like that.Im just very happy. And this doesn't mean I've found *the person*...or that i have too high expectations. I feel very down to earth about it all, after T helping me to see what i *do*, and who knows if it will go anywhere.I have had a great experience with her, so i just wanted to share that.it could be that when you are aware, awake, have your eyes wide open,are more self aware, are on the healing path, send out a desire into the universe and through out your being to connect with like minded, more healthy individuals, or individuals who are working to become healthy, individuals who respect you, and you respect them...maybe it really works."
916,"ps. really important thing i forgot to mentionaparently- when you start giving all those things to yourself that you never had-ie. validation, feeling your worth,you attract others who treat you the same as you treat yourself.Its know ones fault if they attract bad others. Its all a result of programming, and people needing certain others to feel more whole, and others having issues, so they take advantage of those who don't feel they are worthy of being treated with respect and kindness."
917,"This is a topic that I have been working through lately in my own life, and one that I have seen coming up on a couple of threads...Whom have you told? Who in your life knows that you have CPTSD? On the reverse side, whom would you never tell? Did you have good, bad, neutral, surprising, other experiences in telling? Would you do it again? Who would you like to tell but maybe do not have the courage yet, or are unsure if it would be safe?It's a lot of questions. Please feel welcome to respond, or ignore any or all, or to make up your own as best suits you  In my case, I only learned about a year ago that I have CPTSD. I have likely had it since childhood but did not know that that was what it was. Recently, I have made the decision that whenever I can safely do so, and when I feel like I want to do so, I will speak my truth. I am really tired of carrying the burden of someone else's shame and guilt and embarrassment. I had no control over what was done to me, and I am tired of carrying 'blame feelings' for that. I am also tired of the unfairness that people with physical ailments can speak freely and expect and get accommodation for what ails them (correctly so) but that those of us struggling with mental health illnesses and concerns are crammed into a closet locked by shame and stigma. That said, I am not 'out' everywhere. Sometimes, discretion is the better part of valour. And sometimes, I am OK with the situation as it is, or too tired in other ways, or just not wanting to be 'the advocate' in every situation. So: -my friends generally know that I have CPTSD. Some are closer to me than others so know more details. I am also very careful to treat my friends as friends; I have a good therapist to help me with the challenges in my life that need therapy.-on the other hand, I told someone that I thought was a friend. This person, who has the background to know better, gave a 'you just have to think happy thoughts about unicorns and rainbows' response. I was really surprised. I also lost the friendship over it (they were completely unwilling to move past this position and I could not be with someone so dismissive of my challenges).  But, I am still OK with the fact that I told and would likely do it again.-I also recently told a group of collegial persons that I volunteer with. This seemed important as my CPTSD was having an impact on the work that I was doing with the group and causing worry among the other members (e.g. some were concerned that I was angry at them and wanting to quit, etc.). Generally, the telling went well. The others were respectful and hugely supportive. Plus, we reorganized tasks to make them more manageable for me. I am glad that I told and would do so again.   -my FOO does not know. I am NC with almost all, and the FOO is essentially the major cause of my CPTSD. I am in contact with two supportive siblings but am unsure if I will tell them or not. -I would NEVER tell the people in my immediate workplace. Here, there is a culture of bullying from the top down (the head of my section is a bully). While some of the people are likely 'safe', many of the people are also of the mindset that the bully is 'a great leader', so you can imagine the response that I would get. Most also hold social sciences, such as psychology, at best with suspicion but generally worse with contempt.-I am unsure if I would tell another group that I volunteer with. My CPTSD does not affect my work with this group, so it seems unnecessary for them to know. I think most of these people would be safe but they are more teammates then friends. Plus, my volunteering life overlaps with my professional life and I am not sure how that would play out. And really, I enjoy having a space where I can just go and have a good time working with others for a good cause and not have CPTSD be part of it all. It is almost my CPTSD-free zone and I need that in my life. We, as pointed out on another thread, seem to be among the last groups still 'forced' to be in the closet. I am now exploring how to safely open that closet door.   I am starting to plant seeds where I can (with apologies for mixing metaphors). In doing so, I am also surprised to learn how many others are struggling with mental health illnesses and challenges but are also hiding in the closet (or being crammed in against their will), and how many love someone who is dealing with mental illness and challenges. When I tell my truth many are relieved to know that they are not alone and that someone is willing to say something. Sometimes too, the reverse happens; someone has the courage to speak their truth and I am appreciative and relieve to learn that I too am not alone. Yes, sometimes it goes badly and you unfortunately cannot unring the bell. But the results so far have encouraged me to continue planting the seeds when I am able and in a 'good place' to do so.I am hoping others might have stories to share, both where things went well and even where things went wrong so that we can celebrate times that went well and commiserate with times that went less than ideally and learn from both."

Please feel welcome to respond, or ignore any or all, or to make up your own as best suits you   And only answerable with a lot of answers. And by this I do not want to dishonor/disvalue your question in any way.The simple, straightforward and bottom-line answer: I have not told anybody*, except a few ""nobody's""* on an internet forum. *) Take the 'body' quite literally here. It does matter, in a way I don't quite comprehend/could explain myself. I want to take the opportunity to express a heartfelt ""THANKS !"" to the all bodiless people around here. Valueable PERSONS you all are. Make no mistake about it. Secondarily: I have no formal diagnosis, so who could I tell? This may sound like a 'cop out', but it's not that simple/straightforward.Tertiary: I have told quite a few people of my 'struggles in life' along the way, that now spans 50-odd years. I feel 'proud' (for lack of a better word: I 'hate' pride) that I have at least three (male) friends that have been with me on this (long and winding) road for 30 years, and are quite in-the-know about it, even while I have not uttered the word/diagnosis ""cPTSD"" in front of them. They know me, whatever I may 'be'.   to you, dear friends: you know who you are. Quartiary (?): I've joined this forum a just a few months back, and I have told exactly two people about it. And I'm sorry to say that I told both of them about this forum only after I had been exiled from another such forum (which I had not even the time to tell them about) to tell them (great friends who have been very supportive (while not even 'understanding'  ) on my journey the last couple of years). Both of them have expressed great skepticism to me about joining this forum (due to my previous experiences no doubt) and I'm pretty careful telling them much more about my presence (and identifying with cPTSD) here.Fifthly: I've told quite few/a load of people I have descended into alcoholism a bit over a year ago. Between 10-20 people.Sixthly: At the same moment in time, I decided I would/should not tell anybody in my FOO about this, lest I would be shred to pieces by them. Even more so then I already am. My FOO consists of two parents, two siblings, four offspring of siblings and a plethora of extended family. The reason I tell not anybody of them is due to the fact I do not want to inform the 'inner circle' (=the FOO in a strict sense) in any way. In regard to may of the 'outer circle' I 'hide' for fear of 'contamination', not out of fear the outer circle shouldn't know per se.Seventhly: I've told about a dozen people I was seeking additional psychological help, and told them I have taken a SCID-II test to see if I had a Personality disorder, after an anxiety disorder had been ruled out previously. The result of that was negative, and I have been shy to tell most of them I now identify with cPTSD. Which is not to say I'm pretending to them 'nothing is wrong'. I'm just a bit hesitant to present them with another 'presumed' label I could ""put on to me"".TLDR:Specifically: no-one.In general: a whole bunch, in various degrees.QuoteRecently, I have made the decision that whenever I can safely do so, and when I feel like I want to do so, I will speak my truth. I am really tired of carrying the burden of someone else's shame and guilt and embarrassment. I had no control over what was done to me, and I am tired of carrying 'blame feelings' for that.

919,"Great great topic.  Thank you Vanilla.  It feels like another level of recovery that I'm ready to address.And I very much appreciated your thoughtful and thorough response Dutch Uncle.Here are my personal thoughts and experiences regards this topicBefore (4 years ago):Early in my recovery when I just knew about the PTSD and not the C part I told a number of ""friends.""  In all fairness and honesty I think I was too needy of others at the time and become overwhelming for pretty much every one of those friends.  Perhaps it's b/c they were friends I selected prior to recovery w/patterns of abuse and/or neglect.  I suppose there are layers and details that all converge to create the responses I received.  So pretty much all 6-8 people either withdrew or I withdrew b/c I somehow sensed that contact w/them or their responses caused me pain.Now (past 1 1/2 yrs):Positive responses - I've told one close friend, my BF, and my sister-in-law.  My doctor.  My therapist.  They all responded w/empathy and kindness.  They didn't discount my diagnosis, but they didn't dwell either.  It's like they just accepted it as a part of me.  Not big.  Not little.  Just a piece of the puzzle.  They see all of the other aspects of me too.Negative responses - My ex-boss (maybe led to me being let go? although I was able to do my job, not as well as in the past, but not so bad either).  A man who I'd begun to date - he probably had the same diagnosis and ""fled.""Neutral responses - My adult daughter, my teenage son.  Three friends who I made early in my recovery.I don't want to tell my parents, my brother - I sense this weird pity, lack of understanding combined with thoughts that they do understand, that I'm the ""ill"" one and they're ok.  It's all indirect and unspoken.Your post brought a very emotional response for me.  I think it's because I feel the injustice to my very core.  The fact that others can speak so openly of their cancer, their diabetes.  Few people question and many seem to support.  Workplaces, friends, families and strangers rally round to provide support, funding, listen, hug, etc.  But many of those same people would withdraw or discount our experience.  And it's just so incredibly unfair.  Like the modern version of barbaric.I also don't really identify as ""ill""...I feel ""injured""...like I have a normal response to abnormal circumstances.  And I think that I am fighting my own judgemental demons about mental illness that somehow place MI as more problematic or invalid or ? compared to cancer or diabetes or ?Future plan:Perhaps when I fully retire and I do not need to worry that coming out of the closet will become a liability.  Perhaps then I will become 100% ""out of the closet"" where it would benefit myself and/or others.  There's a job nearby working as an advocate w/those who have MI.  The position is intended for someone in ""recovery"" to support others with Mental Illness.  Perhaps I need to consider that work.Now (today):That's as much as I probably need to share at the moment.  I look forward to this ongoing dialog."
920,"Telling others has been a mixed bag for me. I consider myself shy; although most others don't. I'm actually a good conversationalist, once I'm engaged, or have to be. I can be quite funny and extremely witty, which I also recognize as a deflection from the inner pain I carry everywhere. Cptsd is such a cruel mixture of pain, shame, mistrust, self-blame, and gloom; I choose to deflect it more often than not, I guess. The grief runs deep.But sometimes it happens/slips out, at least in bits and pieces. The challenge is still my response. And I've found that scary mix of pity, wonder, and blame from those I've let into what I don't always hide too well. All they know is something's wrong, bothers me.I want, desperately, to fully trust, but I've been shattered by a couple of people, too; then the fear resets and I shrink again. I've told myself over and over I really want to trust and it always seems to happen that I step back again.I'm getting better, I think. Not caring so much what anyone will do with what I tell them. Trouble is, my last ""trustworthy"" person was anything but, and they literally spurned me as if I'm some alien for feeling hyper-sensitive.I guess the onus comes back to me. I know I feel better if I can share, and it seems to filter in sometimes with the simplest comment (e.g. ""something bothering you?""). Fact is, inwardly at least I'm close to tears sometimes...there's so much I find triggering; sometimes the most mundane things can get me there.It's a conundrum, but like other parts of recovery, I hope to find at least a balance, if not full peace, with what seems like someting I need to find a modicum of safety about.  "
921,"I've never told anyone. I've had multiple traumas. I just learned about. The C.... I'm just diagnosed with PTSD (and a multitude of other diagnoses). Guess it would be pretty difficult to get a correct diagnosis when I can't even talk about the most traumatic events. I talk about the ""minor"" ones, laugh about them..hey, it's part of life, right?!. If I ever told, they would be someone to despise me more than I do myself."
922,"I'm pretty open about it; I've told many people, even wrote a Facebook status about going to a psychiatric hospital, but I think the reality of it has only hit a very small amount of people in my life.I did write that I have CPTSD on an application form that asked about my health for an acting gig, and then began to question whether or not this was the reason I was rejected (I gave an excellent audition).I have a feeling saying the words isn't stigmatised as much as showing the symptoms, but I may be wrong. It's also quite normal for people to speak openly about their psychopathology in some art circles."
923,"When i was first diagnosed, i told quite a few people. And some of them were fine. Others pretty much stopped talking to me. And that was fine. My daughter has been supportive, and that's wonderful."
924,"I have just been diagnosed with C-PTSD.  For years and years I've suffered without knowing what I suffer from - I've been misdiagnosed so many times with depression of some sort, which has never 'fitted' how I actually feel.  I've walked in this fog that never seems to lift, since I was a little girl and for so long, have felt disconnected from my life without knowing why.  Now while my diagnosis scares me, it also makes me feel somewhat relieved, as now I have a 'name to put to the face' and can recognise it for what it is.   They say knowledge is power and I hope that learning to know and understand my condition, will empower me and help me to learn to live with it in a more positive way.  "
925,"I can totally relate.  I was reading a paper about 6 months ago, and got such a shock when I read the description of Complex Post Traumatic Stress.  Felt like someone had spied a secret without me knowing!  It's set me on a journey like you, to try and work out the way out of it.  And like you, I also feel a lot better knowing what's going on, and being able to put a name to it.  Good luck darlin!  May we both find our way out of the fog "
926,"Yup, I too got misdiagnosed a few times. When arguing that 'no, that diagnosis doesn't fit' the responses were inevitably 'you're in denial'. I finally said to one therapist 'I GET that something is not quite right in me, but it is a DIFFERENT not quite right than what you are saying'. His response? 'Then what do you think it is?' Of course, I had no answer; unlike him I had not gone to school to learn psychology. But of course my not knowing proved not only that I was in denial but that, because I finally got frustrated and grumped at him must also have something, as yet undiagnosed, else...   In the meantime, it was CPTSD, which does resonate with my responses to life situations. I have only known about the CPTSD which a health care professional finally recognized in me as he had a background in working with people who had experienced very severe childhood traumas.All of that said, I think that the people who make-up the DSM (and likely those who make-up the curricula for psychology degrees) have done a disservice to all of us, both clients and those who are working to help us in our recovery processes. That they fail to recognized CPTSD means that it is difficult for us to get a proper diagnosis and therefore to get proper treatments. I read Dr. Bessel van der Kolk's book, 'The Body Keeps the Score' and later watched him speak on a Youtube video that Kizzie posted on a different topic. In both he expresses frustration that despite multiple studies, huge amounts of evidence, letters of support from those working with people suffering from psychological injuries due to trauma (like those of us with CPTSD), there seems to be an almost willful unwillingness to recognize CPTSD as a legitimate diagnosis, and to fund research on treatments that can help us to get better. It's very discouraging but also a light in the dark that people like van der Kolk continue there work to have us recognized and to do research on how to help."
927,"Me, too.  I'm turning 50 this year and I have recently been diagnosed.  While it explains it and it feels good to have a name on it....it's scary as *.  The occurrences today have flashbacked me into fear and anxiety.  And I know it won't ever go away.  I need to learn to cope better."
928,"I'm feeling a long introduction coming on - consider yourself warned  I'm here because of a new relationship that ended. However as I am trying to understand/deal with it I am also looking at the past 7 years of my life - and the eery similarities of the 2 relationships. So, here I go introducing the stuff rattling in my head that I wish I could figure out. Any help sorting this would be appreciated, that is why I am here  7 years ago my lil brother/best friend was killed in a crash. We were on the phone. It was pretty bad. (kid on drugs hit my brother and his fiance). Anyway shortly after this happened I met this amazing guy. he even told me I was amazing- Whoaa! Never heard that before! I was hooked Soon he was traveling to my state to be with me (he worked 2 weeks on/ 2 weeks off) and within a few months we bought a home. The relationship started having weird things I tried to justify. understand etc...he did not like any of my friends - he accused me of sleeping with many of them, man or woman and eventually we had to find new friends. He did not like my mother. He did not like my brother. And within a few months I had a phone to my head all of the time because he wanted to ""be a part of my day"". Eventually I began wearing a blu tooth 24/7 and (I am fast forwarding I realize this is long) was in fear of us losing a connection, since if we did it was always my fault and I must be trying to call my ""new boyfriend"". Anyway, that was our life. I had my hair cover the blu tooth so people could not see. I was not allowed to visit people unless he was home on his 2 weeks and he was with me. I could not go out to eat with my folks or even drink at home if he was gone. It got to he wanted to watch me  take a sleeping pill on skype so he knew I was going to sleep at night - that I wasn't going to sneak out. And yes we had motion sensors I put on every night when I went to bed, door/window alarms and an 8 camera system constantly recording while he was at work. So yeah - dysfuntional. I never did anything to cause the mistrust though he did create scenarios that I could never get him to understand did NOT happen (like sleeping with my friends - married friends!) Well let's fast forward to April 2015. We were planning on getting married in the summer of this past year. He asked me if we could run off and get married. That I always stayed with him and he couldn’t understand why I did. That he should have married me long ago. I should add that if you saw us in public or went through our photos you would see the happiest couple. He sang me love songs in public - he was over the top when things were good. When things were bad they were very bad (He would jump me and strangle me so I could understand the pain he goes through, he would go out and drink all night, not answering his phone and often not coming home - however he would watch me on the cameras and send me mean text messages...it sucked) In no way can I explain the good and bad here. But you get the idea. So...I thought perhaps he was coming out of a depression he had been going through and also perhaps things were FINALLY turning around for us. Well, we had 5 days of happily married and then on the 5th night he had an outburst - I was tossed around for I believe 20 minutes and then he got a gun and shot himself while standing next to me. I still can't believe everything. I also cannot believe our relationship now that I have emotions and reminders of what my days/nights were like- emotional waves that can physically knock me down.  I don't understand how I could justify everything, put him on a pedestal and well...survive. I also wonder if I had reacted differently - not always forgiving him, would he still be here? Did I do him wrong when I was trying so hard to keep things ok. To avoid arguments, accusations etc.. I hate these feelings.So - 4 months ago I met a guy (T) and enjoyed talking with him. He is retired military, 100% PTSD and we talked about all of that and talked about some of my stuff (I am still wondering if I have PTSD – not sure however online tests say I do. Still unsure though). This new guy (T)  treated me so lovingly, we fell into a relationship. I am 41, no kids and B was the only husband I had - though for only 5 days. This new man seemed so gentle, sweet and I was surprised at how much I was going back to the ways of my old relationship and realizing I didn't have to with him (not being connected by blu tooth and fearing I would get in trouble etc.) I have to be thankful that being with him showed me the severe dysfunction of my previous relationship with B. I made sure I did not overwhelm him with too much B information however he knew the important things that I was dealing with.AND THEN....I was at my house, where B passed. Cleaning B's items out since my new boyfriend (T) didn’t want to go there and see B's items. (T asked me to move in with him in the first 2 weeks of our relationship) I was doing little bits at a time since I had moved in with T.Well on this day, I was giving items to a close friend/neighbor and I put the camera security footage on. For the first time since B passed I watched him and I walk around the house. I could remember the day - and the day hurt very much. He had come home from the boat and walked through the house looking for something wrong. I could see how I pretended to be so happy yet was so scared. I also saw the physical rejection he gave me and it was very weird to say the least to watch. I lost it. I cracked a beer and basically blacked out - not from alcohol- I think from emotions for 3 hours. I cried and laughed and I gave away a lot of items of B’s that I do not remember doing. Then I drove to T’s home. He was furious. I believe I blacked out there as well since I have not been yelled at since the night B killed himself. (I just realized that as I type) T kept accusing me of being drunk - I was not. I did have 3 beers total though in a matter of 7 hours. I also spoke to a friend when I drove and she told me – “you did not sound drunk” and she should know since I did drink a lot this past summer to escape and she was there to help me through it. I don't understand the whole black out thing however once T started yelling at me about breaking promises and lying I don't remember a thing. Augh I hate my head and myself  So - T said I had made a promise to not drink without him (promise was to not go to bars without him and I was at my home surrounded by close friends T knows. I also spoke to him while at home) He told me I was lying about being drunk and that being with me went against his morals. he asked me to leave a few days later, said he did not love me anymore and he can't forgive me. I am a lying drunk   Next day he sent me a message that he had packed my items and they were in his driveway. 3 days later I find out he is posting on wonderful facebook that he was together with his ex posting ""It just took some time to see what I needed was right here all along"". Then 4 days later they were posting being engaged. * happened. T had started with complaining about my friends a few weeks before - telling me they were not my friends. He did not like my work and talked with me about changing my job. Another thing T would do is mention money - costs to upkeep his home or costs of things he bought ""us"" so I was constantly giving him money (even though I had my own home to upkeep as well). It was a very expensive relationship   He even bought $700 of camera equipment to help me with my job (which I didn’t ask - he did it and was excited to help so I went with it) and then he handed me the bill one day   He even typed out over $1200 of items (that I never asked him to buy for me and my home and also it included some of his home costs) and gave it to me in the first month of dating. I've never seen that before. I paid it though. I even gave him money for heating oil, his electric bill, bought groceries. In no way did I not want to contribute. Now these last 2 days he has emailed me asking for his stuff back. Telling me clearly I only think of myself because I haven’t brought it back. The stuff he itemized were mostly items I bought. And goodness I am not asking him about the camera equipment, and all of the items ($1500 worth) that I gave him half for that are at his home. I really don't want to be silly about stuff. I  Now I just don't know what to think. Is the problem me? Am I unable to love someone as they need to be loved? Or is the problem the people I choose and I am just not able to love them the way they need? Am I just a wreck? I've read about narcissism and can see B and T however is it me that is narcissistic? So confused  Too much? Wrong place to post?And how do I respond to T so that he does not continue this hate towards me? I want to do the right thing. I am not sure how to reply to him since he gets so upset over everything I say  he emailed me today that “clearly I don’t care about him and only care about myself because I have not returned his stuff”. Huh? And he may not know I was told of him being engaged. He does not mention it in his emails. In face here is a piece that completely confuses me  “The only time you can come by is if you are dropping a box off in front of my garage and then it better be a drop off and go.  Your calls are meaningless to me because its just you trying to get your way again and ignoring what I would like.  Why would I want to talk to you or try to work anything out with you knowing you just ignore my wishes and only look at your needs.”It sure hurts bad. Losing B hurt bad and this hurts bad as well. I really thought T was sent as a gift and it was going to be a wonderful relationship.  "
929,"Hi beelady,I'm not sure how this fits with CPTSD, or whether anyone on this site is capable of providing you with help. That said, I can offer you a little perspective:If it were me, I would not have stayed in either of these relationships.For B, I wouldn't tolerate the lack of trust; if someone loves me, they need to love and respect the values I live by without demanding proof. I don't believe you are responsible for B's fate in any way whatsoever; he clearly had issues that required professional help; this is something totally out of your depths and you are not to blame.As for T's accusations and demands, I wouldn't tolerate any of that. He didn't support you during a difficult time, and so he is not worth your time.This doesn't seem like a matter of whether or not you're providing enough love; you simply haven't been shown the kind of love you deserve.On the mention of personality disorders... Personality disorders do not have good inter-rater reliability. That is to say, mental healthcare professionals have a very tough time coming to an agreement over who does and does not have a personality disorder, and if so, what type of personality disorder it is. Jumping to the notion that a personality is pathological can be a quick fix, but things tend not to be that simple.Based on what you have written, I can only speculate that you could use a bit of help learning to assert yourself, and that jumping into relationships quickly hasn't served you well. You could use some professional help from a psychologist. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with you; I think you've had some crappy relationships and traumatic experiences and could use some guidance. It may also be useful to talk to a lawyer about the financial demands T is making, and if T is making you feel unsafe, it may be worth considering calling the police.Like I said, I'm just offering a fresh perspective; I'm not a professional.I hope you find the help you are looking for."
930,"Hi, I an new here and reading the posts in various sections really hits home to me and I feel it's nice to have others to talk to. I have a counselor I see weekly too. I am divorcing a npd/asperger spouse (over 20 years). He withheld his knowledge of his autism to me our entire marriage. When I figured it out on my own he confirmed it then immediately wanted a divorce (he discarded me because I now understood the issues between us). He was controlling and manipulative and abusive: gaslighted me, mind games, diminished me, deeply controlling etc.My FOO is a mess. I have a big family: half had PD's/BPD the other not. My mom was BPD as well, my father did not have personality disorder nor BPD. I think I spent the majority of my life distancing from them (the BPD/NPD's) as they created drama and drained/affected negatively all the other people in the family. I also had traumatic loss of non PD/BPD family member and ptsd about that. My mom died a few weeks ago...the BPD/NPD relatives all became enmeshed, I believe, in white collar crime. Like predators: the fact that I went no contact with them a few years ago makes them even more angry at me because they can't ""get at me"" anymore. They cannot exploit me anymore. So, I got letters in the mail, social media posts and phones calls trying to ""mend"" with me which I know coming from them is complete BS. These people are crooks. The worst kind. I always lived a state away from them and due to traumatic illness in a sibling I loved (who was not like these others) I became exposed more to these crooks and it slowly unfolded that they are crooks. They deal in deception crime. It's hard to explain. I only know what my dying sibling told me about them and of course heard through other relatives about the trouble these four siblings would get into. What can I do to feel safe? I am trying to cope with my divorce, live my life, focus on healing flashbacks etc. as best as I can.But to me the BPD/PD they have seems more complicated by the criminal dealings I know they seem to be caught up in. I feel like if they keep trying to get access to me (this despite my explicitly telling them I want NC) I can't endure just ""enduring and taking it"". Do I go to police? I am no investigator, I have no concrete proof about the crime I believe they are involved in, but I feel certain if I shared my suspicions with police they would investigate these people. I am torn about this. I would much rather they go away. I have tried my whole life to escape them. They have ruined the lives of my other non-BPD/non-PD relatives. They don't quit.I feel with my mom's death they are plotting and planning to enmesh with me again somehow. Whether I allow that or not. Does anyone else go through this? My counselor says to be careful about going to police because if nothing is found I have deeper hate from them. But, everyday I look back on what they have done and see there is no way that they are NOT part of crime rings. Torn. I have lived like prey within my marriage and FOO my whole life. Abused, used, lied too, exploited. I want to pick up the pieces but feel the learned helplessness and pts will never heal if I can't get my FOO away from me. I am seeing some progress in my life now that my abusive asperger ex is gone, physically, from my house. That helps. It's not easy: but my panic attacks slowly subsided and I thank god for every day I don't have to wake up and be demeaned under my roof every minute of the day. But then my mom dies and I know those predators don't like the word ""no"". Help. Advice? I don't want to go backwards from my recovery work. I feel like I live in a war zone waiting for bulletts."
931,"For someone who's renowned for their honesty, was a blogger with haters and everything who accused me of 'oversharing' more than once........I'm finding it really hard to talk about the fact that right now, I'm engaged in a group for adult survivors of childhood abuse, and it's bringing lots of stuff up.  I'm this extroverted character, madly in love with my man and the father of 7 of my 8 children, living a chaotic hippy lifestyle, talk about birth, sex and death with all and sundry........and haven't told barely a soul that I'm doing this group, and even in my family we don't really talk about it.  It's like all the parts of my abusive childhood live in separate parts of my brain, and it's hard to draw them all together.  When they're all separate, they don't seem that bad you know?  But when I finally manage to string them together or write them down.......I'm not sure really how to talk about it......it's all so weird and convoluted, and I've SO got that magical mystical relationship with my abuser going on.  It's such an epic story.  I was really pissed the other day when we were talking about grooming tactics in my group, and I realised that all the memories I've got about my dad were of him grooming me.  Isolating me.  And my stepfather.  Really pissed that it was just a tactic, and REALLY didn't mean that I was special.....It's so hard to talk about.  I've got no memories until the day my dad died in the Granville train accident.  He died in 1977, when I was 7, and he was 49 which is 7 x 7.  See that magical attachment slipping in?  I have a few memories before the day he died.  Mostly of him spoiling me, slipping me pocket money, grooming me.....  As the youngest of his seven children, he waited for me to pick a favourite.  As you might understand, the rest of my siblings hate me to this day, for being so spoilt.  I have not a single memory or smell or anything of my mother.  And only a few memories of two of my siblings, who I later had flashbacks of holding me down.  I've got one memory of meeting a school teacher on the stairs, I must have been in first grade.  And we hugged each other!  We loved each other!  And it's the only memory of her I've got.   Over the years, I've had indications that there may have been ritual abuse going on at some point during this fog.  But I can't be sure.So on the day he died, (and trust me, there's a whole magical story to that one too) they sent me to bed before they knew if he was dead or not.  It took them a long time to reach his body.  In the middle of the night I knew he was out in the garden, and I went out to talk to him.  He told me he was dead and I couldn't touch him, and he talked to me for a long time, though I can't remember what he said.  Then I came inside, and in the morning I had mud on my feet.  They told me he was dead, and I said I knew, and I walked into my brothers room, and looked around at the posters on his wall, which I'd never seen before, and thought he looked like an interesting person to get to know.  And that's when my memories start.6 months later, my mother remarried another man.  He was a member of her church, (I was born a mormon), so that was good enough for her.  He told her on their honeymoon that he'd married her because of me.  And she let that go......  So from when my memories start, I was left in a family who resented me for being my fathers favourite (and copping his abuse), and then joined with another father and step father who were sexually abusive, and my memories were miserable and pretty evil in general.  My whole family enjoyed torturing me in various ways.  Which really does my head in.  If what I remember is so evil, what the * have I blocked out?!?!?!?!The next great trauma was when I left home at 14, and got betrayed by EVERYBODY in my life, and lost my home, family, friends, cat, piano, cello, everything.  Which was good ultimately....but traumatic.  At 24 I had flashbacks and body memories when in bed with my girlfriend at the time, and the body memories lasted 6 hours or so, and involved my dad pulling my nappy off me and abusing me as a two year old.  I told my sister, who by then was a stand up comedienne talking about incest (from our stepfather only), and she told me I was full of *, making it up, it never could have happened, and has refused to talk to me ever since.  That was 15 years ago.  There's been so much pain.....So me and my love and my babies have gone a long way to healing a lot of our childhood abuses.  We insist on total and complete honesty to ourselves and each other, and we've accepted our darkest selves and each others, and we're pretty awesome.  But we've managed to keep traumatising ourselves in our living situations.  We've lived with family, and on communities, and we keep triggering off psycho's, getting betrayed, and getting chased out of homes.  We keep unconsciously recreating the trauma of our childhoods.  (My love has child abuse from many, and his own PTSD) For the sake of all of us THIS NEEDS TO STOP!!!!  We've GOT to find ourselves a home with no neighbours, no observers, and no overlords who can tell us what to do.  We need to retrain ourselves, and show our kids what a home as a sanctuary looks, feels, smells and sounds like.  And safety.  We need to keep working on our boundaries too, so our kids and us can finally collect some long term friends.  And even though I'm quite brilliant, do fibre art in a completely unique way (fibre and spinning is my THERAPY and meditation), have written and self published two books, blogged, and juggled about a million impressive balls......I totally sabotage myself, never quite make it, and specialise in spectacular rejections I feel like I'm invisible, no matter how amazing I may be.  Like there's this film of glad wrap between me and life and any kind of material success.  I've done quite a few amazing things that nobody would ever know I had anything to do with.  I had a woman hold my hand once, go all misty eyed, and start channeling while talking to me once, telling me that I'd always have a profound effect on people, but never get acknowledged..........and I don't want that fate.My mother is a whole other kettle of fish.....very cold fish too.  Hated me as the favourite of my father, hated how I looked like him, just hated me in general.......till I got pregnant with my first daughter, then she turned into super, accepting, supportive mum.  Till she finally got her off me when my daughter was 14, and then she completely dumped me and all my other kids back into the soup.  So I never had her, got her in a really lovely way, and then lost her again.  When life is really good, and things are looking up, it's hard to not hear the little voice inside me saying that if my own mother and father could have hated me that bad, who am I to think that anyone will ever really love me, and how could I deserve that?  How could anything successful come to a creature like that?Has anyone got any directions they could point me in to work on these things?  Helpful resources?Ha.  Funny how much I managed to say after all.  Just wish I could do it in real life "
932,"Thank you for sharing so well. It takes a lot, even 'anonymously', to express so much so beautifully and yet still feel stymied. Finding a level of true safety can be so elusive. But we keep trying, sometimes defying our best hopes in the process.I'm going to risk sharing a favourite author's little book that's helped me a lot recently. The title sounds kind of off-putting, but it's not happy talk, it's just a collection of prose/poetry that describes the author's own ongoing healing journey in as realistic a framework as he can.So the author's name is Jeff Foster, the book is ""Falling in Love With Where You Are"". One quote from him: ""Regret is the longing to change the past. Fear is the desire to control the future. Peace is the surrender to Now."" That journey takes us into a lot of pain, and he doesn't shy away from the scars they leave on us. Positive, yes; realistically so, as it includes those journeys through the muck and mire as well as the bright times.I sometimes exhaust myself trying to find ways to cope and/or understand what I can never make sense of about my abusive roots. Then a book like this floats in and uses language in a new way that clears so much en route to rediscovering the essential aliveness we all strive for.Thanks again for sharing your story; hopefully you'll feel free to just be yourself here.  "
933,"Got tears streaming down my face, seems to be what happens when just about anybody acknowledges me in this   Thank you so much for your reply, and that quote made complete sense.  I'm going to go off and find that book   I think joining this forum is going to be a good thing   Thank you again!"
934,"I don't know about any of you, but I imagine I am in good company when I say that the holidays are triggering for me, sometimes subtly.  I am not around my NPD FOO anymore so that has been much less of a source. That said, my NPD M still managed to send along some drama long distance in an email about her current battles with my NPDB (not getting enough attention from him). Sigh, they never change but it wasn't that that triggered me.   As I wrote elsewhere, it was my son coming home.  Very strange as we get along really well and were all looking forward to seeing one another.  So I dug down and there is some old and awful abandonment depression, that cold gray nowhereland I inhabited for long.  It has receded for the most part, but add in some ""holidays were dangerous"" trauma memories, being busy because of work and voila, it rises to the surface. It's a bit different than the danger of being in my FOO.  Then holidays then were dangerous because everyone was emotional and there was always a spark that would set it off and blam, drama x 10, always.  Now, it's dangerous or so my Inner Critic was trying to convince me, because if I am too happy, if I relax and enjoy the holidays with my FOC I  am putting myself in danger of being abandoned like as I was when I was a child.  Hunh?   Did not see that one coming but it makes perfect sense if you have CPTSD. I doubt I would have been able to clearly figure what was happening, why and then do something about it even last year but before that for sure.   So, hallelujah for recovery. It's been a bumpy road, but well worth it.    Anyway, I thought this might be a good thread to start about managing (or not) the holidays.  I should say that until recently I did not manage the holidays well for most of my life. It was always a time for EFs, big ones and as you know that is not something to look forward to so holidays, especially Christmas have had a real sense of dread attached to them. "
935,"Hey Kizzie,I just read your post, and I wanted to reply not only because i wanted to and i relate, but because i know what its like to be alone with this, and I wanted you to know that i hear you and that you are not alone, so i wanted to reply right away.I'm sorry the holidays are triggering for you. They are triggering for me too.  It sounds like, now the drama and fear have gone, you may be feeling feear still, but the sad feelings yo have always had to burry might be coming to the surface. Maybe now your mind feels that it is safe to unleash those feelings.It makes perfect sense to me about worrying about relaxing and enjoying yourself for fear of what might happen.If good things were taken away from you (or bad but it was the best you had..) you would be afraid of that happening again.Anxiety / hypervigelance i know is a way that our bodies and minds think they are keeping us safe.Its so great that you are now able to see what is what- what is going on with you- why you are feeling the way you feel. I also experience dread about the holidays. I think its a great thread to start.Funny, as i worry that writing about xmas and all the things that come along with it, will trigger others, but we do write about all sorts here, that isn't christmas related, so its ok i guess, its a place to write. So thats good!Why is it that I'm so worried about triggering others when it comes to the matter of christmas on the forum?I guess because its a sensitive and upsetting time for me.Im normally relieved when the day is over, perhaps because i spent years with FOO trying to get though the day, and being there for my dad (which was wrong as he uses me and *he* should be being the parent and not so self absorbed- he isn't the only one who is hurting), that this year, spending it for the first time with out them, some feelings are comming to the surface, they have been there for a long time, i have just never let myself cry and have always blocked off thoes feelings. I guess now there is room for me,and as I'm not trying to be cheerful for my dad, there is only me, and i can hear myself and glimpses of sadness I'm too afraid of from the depths of my sole-not to sound too dramatic lol.I hope you are ok Kizzie, we are here for you. Such a great realisation you had. You are not alone.   "
936,"Nice title.  I've had a very a-typical X-mas season this year: for the first time in 20 years or so I didn't visit my 'mom's' birthday on the 25th. Also for the first time in 15 years this was a year where the whole FOO (excluding divorced dad) could have come 'together'.So quite some pressure on me has been exerted on me to come, and wild accusations have been made towards me, and hoovers attempted.Nobody has asked me why I didn't come, and I'm pretty sure they have invented their own story as to why I didn't come: my NC with sis. I could have come regardless of that.Which isn't why I didn't want to join.I have decided to leave that as it is: they'll make up their own crazy world anyway, so any attempt to 'reason' with them is futile. Any JADE will only lead to Circular Arguments and DARVO.And as I said: they haven't asked, so apparently they are not interested in my point of view anyway. So why try to give it to them?In quite a significant way for me this is sticking to my plan to fully become the ""invisible child"" I always was for myself, while 'they' make/treat(ed) me as the scapegoat.Yes, I do feel a bit dazed after this 'first time'. But it does feel as a fresh start. A year where I've put the trash in the dumpster. I've created room for something else to fill the space next year. Or leave it spacious as it is.  Quote from: Kizzie on December 26, 2015, 05:23:14 PMI am not around my NPD FOO anymore so that has been much less of a source.

I guess now there is room for me,and as I'm not trying to be cheerful for my dad, there is only me, and i can hear myself and glimpses of sadness I'm too afraid of from the depths of my sole-not to sound too dramatic lol. It's not dramatic at all IMO Indigo, it's a gut wrenching pain that none of us should even have had to feel let alone relive over and over each time the holidays come around. I suppose that's why I have been taking all things in recovery bit by bit (our famous baby steps we talk about so much here). We are traumatized in the very depths of our soul and that is not something to be taken lightly.  It deserves a lot of attention, care and time to heal.  I think by writing about it at whatever stage we're at is helps us to heal.  I know when I read posts by members at OOTF that were farther along in recovery than I was, I help on so tightly to the hope that I would get there too one day.  Quote from: Indigo on December 27, 2015, 12:20:22 AMI hope you are ok Kizzie, we are here for you. Such a great realisation you had. You are not alone.      Thank you Indigo, you are such a kind person  Many   back to you. "
938,"Quote from: Dutch Uncle on December 27, 2015, 08:58:18 AMIn quite a significant way for me this is sticking to my plan to fully become the ""invisible child"" I always was for myself, while 'they' make/treat(ed) me as the scapegoat. Yes, I do feel a bit dazed after this 'first time'. But it does feel as a fresh start. A year where I've put the trash in the dumpster. I've created room for something else to fill the space next year. Or leave it spacious as it is.   That's very significant Dutch, it's about you now and that's recovery,      much like Indigo said about having room for her now.  That sense of space is both scary and exciting at the same time.

939,"QuoteI noticed you said you feel ""dazed"" which sounds like you did not have an EF or dissociate and if that's the case   and  No EFs, no dissociation.In fact, I have never before seen so clearly 'they' are not interested in my story, but simply will go with their own 'invited story'. Hence nobody even asked why I have 'passed' on the invitation.Got a few times a bit of FOG emerging: ""I noes! Now they'll team up and gossip and all be indignated I didn't come!"" but I was able to let that pass almost instantly: What can I do about such a possibility if they do not even take an effort to get informed by me?They got their minds made up So much easier, in a wayI also convinced myself that IF this X-mas will resurface in a conversation, I will have to make clear to them that I'm willing to tell them why I didn't come, but only at a time when they first will have erased their pre-conceived 'reason(s)' on why they think I didn't come from their minds. As it is now, my reasons would have to be 'stronger' than the ones they invented in order to convince them. That would be an uphill struggle. They first need to have an 'open mind' in order to have a chance of my story taking hold in the first place.A level 'playing field' needs to be in place, and only they themselves can level the skewed field they have created. Not me.Until that happens, I'm not playing ball.(and possibly I will not even 'play ball' after that, but that's a 'worry' I can put aside, at least for now.)Quote from: Kizzie on December 27, 2015, 08:09:05 PMYes, that's it. My ICr was also saying ""Hold back emotionally because if your H and/or son abandon you, it will devastate you.""  Pardon my curiosity, but how where your holidays with H and son? I hope, wish and trust you weren't abandoned in the slightest. "
940,"You may never get that level playing field but it sounds like you okay with that now.  It took a long time but I realized that my FOOs skewed reality is their actual reality and that's why it is so difficult, fruitless really to try and break through.  They believe utterly in the reality they have created.  So any effort is wasted breath for the most part, unless it is the satisfaction of speaking our truth.  If it is to get to that level field, it is a frustrating endeavour to be sure. They simply live in a different world and there are so many better ways to expend our precious energy.  Seems to me you have levelled the playing field in the sense that you are playing by your rules now. That shift is monumental In recovery I only.My son is still here and we were having a wonderful time - no hint of abandonment because of course it is not there and never has been.  This is the first time my son has seen me use a walker and he didn't miss a beat.  I realized in that moment that he loves me, my spirit, who I am as a person and a mother. It was an amazing moment of clarity about what it means to be loved. .  "

942,"It's ironic, how our FOO affect us differently and yet we end up in the same place - CPTSD.  I do not like to go all out any more because my NPDM made every holiday such an intense, pressure filled extravaganza of decorating, feasting, family gatherings which may have looked good but underneath - anger, tension, drama.  Yuk, yuk, yuk!  We used to go all out for our son but he is off at university and is content with a more subdued XMas when he comes home. Nowadays my H and I are quite happy to maybe put up a tree, have a lovely XMas dinner out and call it a day - so much less tension and pressure!  I am NC with my extended FOO and NPDB and LC with my NPDM so it's easy to do. We've actually talked about going south and skipping XMas altogether. Will your FOO be hoovering when you don't go all out do you think?  That can be difficult at first because of their expectations. "
943,Getting rid of the holidaze - we really have to include this under self-care      
944,"""Holidaze"" is a good word.Dh and I will probably try to dodge both our FOOs this Christmas, which won't be easy... simply emigrating to a tropical island isn't practicable, unfortunately... "
945,"This is my third holiday season 'new style' coming up. No Halloween here, Christmas is the biggest holiday of the year (we have festivities from 24th through 26th).First year, frankly, I felt totally dispirited: Instead of a large number of people on three different days there would only the four of us. It felt like neither decorating nor cooking nor baking --- nor the frantic house cleaning because of the people who'd be spending a week in our home... Even the idea of the small number of Christmas presents that would be lying under the tree depressed me. We discussed it as a family and decided to have a quiet Christmas - just our little FOC - and rent a cottage where we could spend the new year celebrations with some friends and their kids. We also broke with the traditional meals and instead all of us came up with ideas what each felt would make for a nice Christmas brunch and dinner and we all helped get it ready. No frantic cleaning, just the normal stuff, and we also rediscussed the decorations.  After the three days of Christmas, both kids said that it was the 'best Christmas ever'. When I asked why that was they answered: ""This time, it was about us."" --- That's when I realized that in my frantic attempts to please the (...no nice word for them springs to mind...) of my FOO who don't even appreciate it (!) I forgot to make it about us.So, that's really all I want to say to you: Make these holidays about you. Whether you go to the Bahamas or hang around in your pyjamas all day doesn't matter as long as you can enjoy the spirit of the holiday and find peace in your heart. Maybe not as ideal as the romantic Christmas songs suggest - but also a whole lot better than the endless hassle and demands and put downs that holidays with many FOOs actually look and feel like.  "
946,"Feeling blessed that my best family has been a gathering of friends, most often at my house, for the holidays. In my 20s, my mother declared she was no longer cooking for the holidays. Rather than taking over, I started my own tradition. Everyone brings something so I'm not burdened with all of the cooking, and it's SOOO much fun 100x over anything I grew up with. Sometimes best holidays arise from defining a new family. Take care -"
947,"thanks for saying that.    I was telling it to myself most of all, because I kept on chasing a dream and it never came true. "

949,"This year (like last year) I will be escaping Christmas by running off to the country for a meditation retreat. Gone no contact with FOO couple of years ago and no partner or close friends to speak of, so its that or spend it at home by myself. I found it very healing....winter being a time to let go of the old to welcome in the new and all that. And the people were friendly, so it was nice. "
950,"A meditation retreat sounds lovely Zenfox, whereabouts if you don't mind me asking? We will be staying home for Christmas, but my son is coming home from university so we're really excited about that as we live on the opposite coast and don't get to see much of him at all. And this year my NPDM is spending XMas with my NPDB so it's just us and we couldn't be happier - no pressure, no having to manage all her PD behaviours (they really ramp up at XMas or any holiday for that matter), just our little FOC enjoying the holidays together.  "
951,"We don't celebrate it in my country, but happy Thanksgiving? Is that what one wishes? I hope all overseas members have a lovely day full of turkey, peace, friendship, and hot chocolate.    We're baking Christmas cookies today, because this Sunday, we're going to light the first candle on our advent wreath, and that necessitates Christmas cookies and a hot drink. "
952,"Thanks, Cat!  Gobble, Gobble!Yes.   Happy Thanksgiving is the well wishes here in the States.Ah, Christmas cookies ...these look yummy!!!!   Do you make the speculaas ones too?http://www.marthastewart.com/343667/speculaas-cookies"
953,"They're lovely, but we don't have the forms you'd need, and they look complicated to make. We might make these, these and these, because they're quick and easy, and last year I made brownies, cutting them into circles, and decorating them a bit. Huge success, and it's very quick to make. And then I'll cheat by buying some ready-made cookies and adding them to the plate. Rather, no: it's not cheating, it's efficiency. Vorsprung durch Technik and all that. Ahum."

956,"I know I'm late to this thread, but never mind, had a lot of stressful stuff going on before christmas.BeHea1thy- what you said struck me and was just what i needed to hear:Turning that corner on your first holiday since diagnosis (or enlightenment) is always a challenge. It's gonna be new & different,  regardless of what you do. It is. This year was strange not spending it with my dad. The FOO have not had it together for ages since parents divorced.It would have been super hard going back home to dads-, its not home, and its stressful enough with the grief I feel, spending it away from him and not seeing my sister etc. due to all the family issues. This year it was new and different and I guess it will continue to be so until the christmas period is over.  It will be new and different- i knew this, but i feel sad. I need to remember this. Thanks and i hope everyone did have a good thanksgiving no matter what you did. "
957,"I know that there is anger suppression and dissociation.Do you know if there is such a thing as suppressing anger so much that you feel it, but then it goes right away like it never even existed?Maybe that means that your best efforts at disassociating from it are working.i just tried thrashing some pillows, as anger was seething under the surface- but i felt numb , not angry.Its like the anger has just vanished under my skin, like it wasnt even there. This is frustrating. "
958,"I feel that. Sometimes I can feel mad, and it progresses to angry tears...other times it just fades away, like it did not exist.A couple of times I did get to rage, but I pulled my hulk back, he's ugly! And yep scares me. I was never allowed to express negative feelings, and I maintained clinical detachment from them growing up..only occasionally breaking down when I was alone. Easier to connect anger to my first marriage, I guess being more recent."
959,"Hi EmoVulcanThanks for your reply.Its good to see that someone can relate.Same here about not being allowed to express negative feelings.My anger scares me too. I dont think i was feeling the anger fully enough for it to come out, but i think it should of come out.Maybe in time it will get easier. I have not broke out of dissociation yet though or anything.Yes, i find anger is easier to connect to events that have just gone- more present events.= and not the past so much."
960,"Lately, I have been trying to be open to the idea I may be resisting feeling/dealing with anger at my abusive father...the problems are many with this, instilled blocks to anger, obedience, and. Even rebellion.  But, if I understand nothing else, I recognize my father was also a victim of a cycle of abuse...I think that merits compassion for him,  not to excuse, the act was reprehensible, selfish in nature and without regard to consequences..though that has to be torture to know how fragile his safety from them, and I could not avoid them, in fact fear of everything I knew being decimated kept me silent..as it does for many I think.  So, I do not know for sure, but I think I am OK with my childhood, and iii may indeed my marriage I need to deal with now to continue integrating my inner child into a whole self.I think that is factually where I am, I suppose time will tell."
961,"EmoVulcanI think i know whats going on with me, might be the same for you too.I am a disasociator, always have been, the sort of dissociation that happenes in my head with out choice to block things out.I feel like I am a bottle, with so much energy and anger in there, only when i try to take the lid off (express the anger), nothing comes out- the lid is too tight shut on the bottle.I know i dont feel feelings like most people. The emotional numbness I'm comming to realise I have, that i never realised before, is scary. My T wanted me to focus on where i feel things in my body, and I'm realsieing how much energy is in there, even nervous, agitated energy, that comes when i feel nothing at all, when i feel dead inside, and i need to feel something which is why I'm addicted to crisis, apart from the fact that my brain expects unhappiness and crisis because of my previous home life, as well as self sabotage etc.- there are so many layers, no wonder this is hard to unravel.Im comming to realise too that I'm afraid of being empty, if i have no anger etc. and theturbulant emotions settle down...im scared i will literally be empty.Apparently this is just a phase in recovery...but to feel nothing?!!Yes, disasociating for so long, being punished for asserting boundaries, for expressing anger and or other emotions, the brain has learnt not to let go.Even when i do let go unintentionally when pushed just too far, i disassociate when  rage, so i never feel the anger when Its comming out anyway!Yes, fear , keeping silent is control.I want through a phase of *forgiving* my mother, only that wasnt real. I blamed myself and thought i was wrong when now i have a T telling me it wasnt me.Im angry at her, and whilst i feel empathy for her, Im still angry or rather, - getting there.The anger i had towards her growing up has been long suppressed.I must of had to suppress it big time living with that much rage- and truth is, i did.So yes, just wanted to say that maybe you think you are recovered on this bit, but you might not be, however , you also might just be."
962,"Indigo!I can relate so much to what you are describing! I can get irritated at times but true anger is always quickly suppressed with a sudden feeling of panic and fear, then I just go numb.I relate this to abusive parents that became offended whenever I tried to set boundaries between us, and if I got mad they also became mad and violent or threatening.So it wasn't good for my survival to be mad and stand up for myself, it was better to sneak away from them and try and create some space for myself to exist despite what they said.This have followed me around, as a sort of rebellious resistance that I will disobey as soon as the authority figures are not looking. Also the addiction with crisis, usually in love relationships.I guess that if you live with relationships that are in crisis and long for a better day then that is all you know and will repeat over and over.Or just not have any relationships at all :/ I only got one tip for you: Don't try and pressure yourself to feel this anger.I tried this in therapy and it became very traumatic, partly because my T didn't notice that it was too much for me as my facial expression doesn't show what's going on inside.So she kept pressuring me until it drove me into a blur and I had to stop seeing her.Thank you so much for posting about this!  It feels good to finally read about someone that can relate to this complex emotional dilemma. "
963,"Hi Bimsy,Panick and fear - i dont always realise what is going on with me, and in therapy i am currently working on just noticing, so yes, panic and fear over takes and leads me to feeling numb.Im sorry about your childhood experience when it comes to your parents and anger and boundaries. Its not fair is it and I'm sorry it happened to you and that it is causing you difficulty now.It was the same for me. Now if pushed too far and i do rage, i come out of my body whilst its happening, then feel numb when its over.I wasnt allowed to question anything, wasnt allowed to set healthy boundaries, wasnt allowed to express anger or feelings.I have that rebellious streak too.Yes, i agree that we repeat all we know over and over.Thankyou so much for the tip.I havent been pressuring myself to feel. Yesterday anger came, and i was able to express it at my punch bag.Its pretty overwhelming and scary. Im beginning to notice all this energy and anger inside me, since I'm getting more n touch with where i feel emotions in my body, and i think yesterday i reached my limit and i did it for my own sanity and my own physical health.I vomited after and felt really nauseous, not sure if it was a mini panic attack, but i was hyperventilating and felt anxious after releasing rage.I guess we are wired up to expect punishment and scary things to happen when we express anger.How crazy that your T didnt notice that you wasnt ready to do the anger thing. Im sorry you had to leave, that sucks. I hope you have or will find a better therapist.We are taking things really slow, and thats good.Its also good to have others who can relate. (bitter sweet).good luck with anger and this journey. Im guessing your new here, so if so, welcome, glad to have you.  "
964,"Thanks for the welcoming  everyone is so nice here, it's wonderful to see!I am sorry to hear that you did also experience these problems with your parents!In a way I figured it must have been something like the things I went through since we seem to react pretty similar.I do remember now that I actually can become angry if I am pressured into a corner, from what I've heard I look pretty scary when that happens I don't really know, I just get really mean and defensive until people leave me alone.  I'm glad to read that you are working with your anger, in the future I wish to do the same thing.For me my anger usually feels like a clump in my throat, I've read or heard somewhere that it feels like that when you hold back things that you really need to say.May I ask where you feel your anger?It sounds like you are going through some sort of cleansing, both spiritually and maybe physically (with the vomiting), it seems intense! How did you feel afterwards?I admire your courage to deal with these feelings, I think I can imagine just how scary it must be.  By the way, is your T educated to take care of people with PTSD and CPTSD?I'm just asking since I am looking around for someone that is.I hope you don't mind me asking a lot of stuff  I just want to know everything now that I know about CPTSD!"
965,"Hi BimsyAww, no problem..everyone is nice here i agree, including yourself. And totally fine about the questions- dont mind at all. If you didnt ask, you wouldnt know ad its great that your asking. I have lots of questions and started out with tonnes. Interesting. I feel anger inside my chet and stomach. Maybe my back stores it too as my back aches a lot.I like the idea of going through cleansing! How cool is that! I hope so. Maybe a spiritual awakening or something, but i think that happened already.Afterwards I felt really sad, so cried for a minute, then felt sick and panicky, I was hyperventilating, and I felt anxious that some punishment was going to come, even though i was alone in the house.Thankyou so much about the courage. It is pretty scary.T is educated to deal with Cptsd and Ptsd.I asked her lots of questions that i found fro the internet, to see if she specialised in the aeas i thought she should specalise in.I hope you find someone. Its a bit trial and error finding the right one sometimes."
966,"Thank you Indigo Trial and error indeed, I've already contacted a place in another city that deals with PTSD so we'll see what they have to offer!The anger feelings in the chest sounds very emotional, if I try and feel what that would feel like I kinda feel like someone hurt my feelings.Can't really figure out the pain in the back though but I am curious of what it could mean!Maybe some sort of physical anger, like wanting to attack someone.. I don't know  I'm just playing with the thought as I like to imagine how other people feel things.You said you felt sad after the rage, I think my emotions usually comes in that order too.First we get attacked and feel angry and defensive and then the hurt emotions, sadness of being hurt by someone we trusted.That is how I think of it anyway  It sounds like you're doing the right thing anyway, a good cry is always very cleansing I think!Sometimes it's hard to know if it's a rewarding kind of pain that leads to healing eventually or if it's a kind of pain that just adds to the burden.Like when you are in therapy and think that it's supposed to hurt before it feels better, there is a difference between healing hurt and just being hurt again though.So I always look for that good kind of hurt, it's not easy but essential I think!And you seem to have the good kind of hurt from what I can tell  what a great thing!"
967,"Spartanlifecoach just talked about throat constriction as a symptom of highly demanding parents, it also makes sense! "
968,I have the same thing happen so I don't really try.  Maybe it would help to focus more on accepting anger as a reality.  My problem is trying to deny it exists so trying to express it in order to get rid of it doesn't work.   I'm thinking an indirect approach would be better-just say I accept that I'm angry and then it will naturally come out somehow.  
969,"Hi BimsyGood luck with the PTSD place.Maybe someone did hurt your feelings. I have it when others are disrespectful or impolite, but really under there is sadness that they are being this way.Yes me too about the pain in the back. Do you have this too?The anger for me anyway is very physical and verbal.Yes, that order of emotions - anger then sadness makes sense. Anger is usually the pushier emotion that wants to come first. It is a protective defence, against others, but also for us, to stop us feeling the sadness underneath.T said to me that my anger has been so long suppressed that other feelings are starting to leak out beneath the lid that is anger.That is how I think of it anyway  I know. I think that all pain is healing, you might find you have new pain that adds to the burden, but it may come from a similar place, and I guess that burden can be a big one, but one day it will be expressed and things will shift.Yes sure, if you are hurt again, that is an opportunity to learn, however it sucks i know.And that- being hurt again that you may experience now from other people in your life, it could be a pattern that we are sub consciously repeating. I know not everyone likes to hear that. Its not our fault. We attract similar situations and people into our lives to the origional abusers we had.I think that any kind of hurt we experience, weather present, or a reminder of the past, is al because of old hurts as in my life anyway, the real hurts i have experienced mirror the origional hurts in my childhood.Hope this makes sense."
970,"Hi tired,Im not sure if i have accepted anger as a reality. Expressing anger started after T said to me to notice where I feel things in my body- anger etc.I realised that my body is knackered, its in pain, and i have so much tension, anger and anxiety swirling around inside there all the time.This week was very flashbacky, in an angry way, and i realised that i was too restless to come home and not do anything about it. I didnt want to stuff it, as, with therapists validation, i felt that it was ok to be angry- as i am being treated unfairly in my life now by certain others, and i was by my parents.I felt i had no choice but to explode with rage, so i did.I have been looking at boundaries too and I'm angry because it seems that my bounties are not respected- in fact, i know they are not.I watched a youtube video on boundaries and i felt angry and think I'm starting to believed that what my parents did to me was not my fault, as in, i didnt do anything what so ever to deserve them treading on my boundreis and treating me as badly as they did.T said to me too to say to myself- I'm angry, when I'm angry. I dont do this all the time, nut it may help you. I think it will come when ever it comes.Maybe realising what happened to you, what *really* happened to you and maybe how its manifesting in your life now may help?What my parents did was wrong making me suppress everything i felt under the sun, punishing me for any tiny expression of anger i made, and like a tiger locked in a cage, these feelings rattle around inside of you, and i went mad, developed ocd and anxiety...if i care so much for those animals, and that is like what happened to me, then that is awful and i dont deserve that. Im now carrying on suppressing stuff like my parents wanted me to, being a good little girl but now i dont give a ****.I hope this helps you somewhat. It will come. I honestly think seeing a T has helped me wit this - I'm not done, but she has set it rolling."
971,"Being angry basically means losing my parents forever. Because it means yes they failed, it's true that they failed, and I can never talk to them again. It means that there is no way I can become a child and have parents.  My lifelong ambition, to have parents, will never happen.  Blocking all contact with them was the first step for me and after 2 years of going back and forth, I've been feeling less guilty and at the same time more angry.  I feel like I'm hurting them this way but I can't do anything about it.  I can't make them into better people.  The weird thing is that when I feel angry I immediately stop feeling it.  It disappears when I feel it.  But it's like I have so much of it and I can't take a lot at once.  I imagine I will die if I do.  Maybe it's true that too much stress from feeling anger can raise your stress hormones and kill you.  I worry about that."
972,"I am in a new romantic relationship.  We've been communicating daily for about 2 months.  He contacts me daily, is kind, appropriate, attentive.  But now he's taking a few hours instead of a few minutes to respond to my phone calls or texts.  It triggers me.  I don't want to scare him away, or sound needy, but I also don't want to experience this trigger.  Thoughts anyone?  Suggestions?"
973,"I would like to ask you you a few things after reading this.Though there's no need to answer any of them.Apart from those questions I'd say: It's pretty normal that after the first 'high' of a romantic relationship the infatuation (? English is not my first language) subsides a bit, perhaps he is a bit ahead of the curve on this in comparison to you. I would not think too much of it. But hey, thinking is really not a top-priority/faculty when falling/being in love, so be gentle with yourself in this.  The questions:- What does it trigger to? Do you have any idea?- What do you experience when he responds after a while? Do you then feel as good as when he responded 'instantly'? Or is it different?Closing remark: You are a very loveable person. This new romantic relationship proves it. Perhaps you can say that to yourself (or your inner child, or your inner critic) when you get triggered. "
974,"Thank you for the questions.  That's exactly what I need to meditate about, what does it trigger to...in the emotional mode it's hard to stop and think to understand.  When I'm not triggered (like now) I can do so.  And check in w/my T about this topic. Usually after BF calls all of the anxiety subsides (one time in two months it didn't subside so much).  And I think that was b/c he said something I misunderstood and rather than clarify in the moment I let it slide and then thought about it too much bit afterwards.  I am learning how to assert and clarify in the moment.Like you said, infatuation is the name of the stage.  Although, even though English is my first language, I don't care for that word to describe the stage, not hopeful enough I think.  Perhaps there is a better version in another language?  I am open to one.  He and I don't communicate in English either.This last time when I was feeling insecure I posted here, processed and then called him when I felt more ""settled.""  We had a wonderful conversation.That said those two questions you mention are spot on.  I will be paying attention and to them as things progress.  I don't know what it triggers to, but I do feel as great when he responds later as when it was ""instant.""And yes, that inner child self-talk about being lovable is a great take away lesson no matter what happens.  I believe all of these ""tests"" life deals to us are signs of something we need to learn, so that is perhaps a big one for me and many of us who are healing from cptsd."
975,"Hi C, I have experienced the same thing many times and I can relate to those feelings of insecurity when in new relationships.I think that three things are going on. firstly being ""in love"" or Eros, call it what you will, provides us with a huge rush of neuro-transmitters, seratonin dopamine etc  that act like opiates and can override our critical parent and makes feel nice and warm,. the work of Helen Fisher is an essential read to understand how they work like very strong addictive drugs. what we do is associate our nice feelings with the person rather than the neuro_transmitters, a nice trick that nature plays on us. what also happens is that when the stimulus is taken away or threatened, serotonin levels drop and you do cold turkey, your body craves them which makes us want to be with that person. then your critical self steps on and starts to tell you that your lover and the source of those drugs has left and is not coming back. that hurts of course.Additionally, if you have cptsd you have issues with trust and on a sub conscious level expect that your boyfriend will either just desert you or find somebody else. from experience I believe that this is the basis for most men being unfaithful, they have trust issues and will look for other love interests to mitigate the risk of being left alone. the fact that we are attracted to people who remind us of our parents means we play out a replay of our child hoods in the hope that we can find a partner who will care for and nurture us.I used to secretly spy on new gfs to see if they were cheating, as a serial philanderer I was always expecting my partners to cheat, I had been in the military and seen so many wives out on the town picking up young guys. it wasn't until I left the military before I understood this as abnormal. I had a couple of nice girl friends who helped me with trust issues.I have found that knowing the mechanics of why I feel pain helps me realise it's a brain trick and not real.Best wishes"
976,"First off congratulations C!  I know this is a big step for you to trust yourself enough to try again.  Go C!  Whoo-hoo!  Now to your questions. I am automatically transported when I see love questions back to all of the study I have done of John Grays work (Men Are From Mars).Some thoughts from his work, and not in any order:1)    If a man has not overtly expressed any sort of withdrawal other than a slow down in response rate it generally has NOTHING to do with us.  It is usually something (not us) that is on their mind and taking priority, or circumstances we know nothing about that prevent them from making a rapid response.  In any case treating it this way - as HIS deal, HIS issue and nothing to do with you may help calm the fears.2)   Another way John and his daughter Lauren suggest to get what we want from a person is to thank them and praise them and appreciate them when they do what we want, when they do what makes us feel good.  So the times that he DOES respond quickly?  Appreciate and point out how great it makes you feel, how special you feel to be high on his priority list.  Its reverse nagging.  Instead of complaining you compliment and highlight and appreciate the behavior you want.  Or even if he is slowing down, you can still smile and tell him how great it makes you feel when you hear back from him quickly.  So its something to try.  There is NOTHING wrong with wanting to be important to someone!3)   Another thing Lauren Gray suggests early on in a new relationship is to treat it like you would a pair of shoes you are thinking of buying. You are looking them over, so how do they fit?  Are they comfortable?  Are you looking for dressy and they are hiking boots? That wont work!  Its an experimental period for both people, and her point is you DONT ask yourself if the shoes like you.  You ask yourself if YOU like the shoes. Putting ourselves first is a strange new way of acting for those of us with our past, but it is a part of healing.  Making what we think and feel just a tiny bit more important. So you can give genuine effort with what I suggested above, but ultimately you do need to be happy with the shoes!4)   Last and not least is we need to have full lives ourselves and be happy ourselves to have a happy relationship. If we dont have lives that are full enough, sometimes we can over focus on things that are not deal breakers. And make ourselves miserable sweating the small stuff.  So I would encourage you to have a list of deal breakers, and to live by your standards and what you want. You are equally important and deserve love care trust and respect.All my best to you and I wish you happiness, peace and joy. You are a wonderful kind caring person who has a lot to offer and who deserves to feel safe warm and loved.  Your friend, Vey Foggy"
977,When I get like that I need to snap back into myself. The problem is the attachment to someone else. Then if they leave even for a moment for any reason I'm lost in space.  Try something that is just you . An activity that is only yours. If it's too hard and you're wrapped up in anxiety try going for a drive or taking a long shower with the intention of snapping out of it and then right afterwards do something you love that is solitary and unrelated to that person. That's what works for me when I can pull it off .It also helps if I say to myself oh well I guess he doesn't like me. He's going to leave me like everyone else does and I've survived before so I will survive again.  Basically a worst case scenario . I'm good at dealing with tragedy so that works for me. What happens is that the person doesn't leave and I'm surprised and happy. It's weird.  
978,"Thank you everyone.  These are all terrific ideas.  Some I've tried successfully and some are new.  Either way it's great to hear the validation as well as stretch my skills.  I do the worst case scenario and it helps.  Also the reminder that it's a brain ""trick."" Sometimes I sense that new neurons are forming connecting the emotional part of my brain with the rationale part so that I don't get stuck and can assess things in a healthy way.Things continue to go well by the way.I love the shoe metaphor although I like to have a lot of pairs and types lol  But I think that in my case refers to versatility, not multiple people   Like I can wear healed sandals the same day I wear hiking boots if I hike by day and then dance at night."
979,"I just started to explore Helen Fisher's web site.  That is exactly what I've been looking for to help me understand and explain healthy relationship development.  Like many of us I have very very limited experience either observing or participating in a healthy romantic relationship.  I love the way she structures the information, the extent of the research, etc.  Thank you. "
980,"C that's really great that you have found her work as valuable as I do. I was recommended her by a friend who is a professor of neuro-science in Fairbanks, if she has peers who think her work has value then that means we are on the right track.I have never really been able to use strategies, as the critical parent is so overwhelmingly powerful, as is the withdrawal from those brain drugs. I just try to keep busy computer games help immensely. After reading Fisher, I believe Valentines day should come with a health warning, as should boxes of chocolates, romantic weekends and tables for two.  "
981,Hi My t said 'it seems the hardest area for people to work with is the relational work ( relating to others )..Yep can relate to that one ...I can see am on the shiny beginning of attracting more healthy relationships - this is my intention from now It seems Easier now to spot co dependence illness in others and I can see I've come on with this myself Last nite I was with a women 'friend' and there was on judgement of me after another - she was disinterested in things I was sharing (ie not listening and not present and I more judgement came when I didn't answer her need to be confirmed - It's easy to be resentful but I know today co dependence is an illness Progression for me is that I worked to stay in my own power and not get too sucked in -- Took it to meditation time this morning and it feels right to 'leave' For me now it's about listening to that voice/ feeling inside of 'I'm not enjoying this relationship ' trust my judgement I intend to relate to others who aren't in co dependence illness who have done 'enough work on self and work on relating In the meantime I continue to work on my progress in relating My issues have / can still be Being closed off - freezing when I find someone difficult esp when they talk too much Being too switched on and open - bringing the wrong people too close Beating myself up for not being Perfect in my relating Taking in others feelings / personalities Feeling guilty being in my own energy ie I should be in your energy - you are more important Feeling judged by others The recovery is - Finding more middle ground in relating ie taking more of me ' out of the equation and just relating in general - having fun keeping it light sometimes - doesn't have to be ll emotional and doom gloom Accepting myself where I am t any given time Being in myself and feeling ok with that - it's good to be in my own energy - I am important and I can do this and relate with others too ( find this difficult And as  result of this I hope to 'feel less judged by others as I have less out ward radar Do people relate ' ( ha ha to this stuff What have been your experiences ? Recovery ideas v welcome 💓
982,"certainly can relate Boatssr!  QuoteMy issues have / can still be Being closed off - freezing when I find someone difficult esp when they talk too much Being too switched on and open - bringing the wrong people too close Beating myself up for not being Perfect in my relating Taking in others feelings / personalities Feeling guilty being in my own energy ie I should be in your energy - you are more important Feeling judged by others oh yeah, same here. beautifully succinctly expressed.  you are way ahead of me on this one. the biggest step i have taken is to leave behind virtually all my relationships. becos ultimately even the 'good' ones were not helpful.  i like what you say about being in your own energy. i have never done that, really, except on my own in my little pottery when i still had it.  people have always come first, and it took years to realise how much damage i had done to myself becos of it. or damage was done to me. never sure how much blame to take. i guess i haven't begun the journey to form healthy relationships. i don't feel safe enough. and i don't trust myself to not fall into the unhealthy patterns that have been all i have ever known.  will it ever happen? i can't say, at the moment. it feels hopeless for me. but i read your posts and think, well, maybe..."
983,Thank you Arpy  🌸Quote 'never sure how much blame to take ' I can relate to this ...Should we be taking any blame ? It's where I came from fo I was conditioned to 'others come first' and so 'my pattern is to become 'friends' with people who are emotionally unavailable for me because they are unavailable for themselves - Yes and I have been unavailable for me emotionally / spiritually and so allow this relating --- as don't know any different I'm done with beating myself up --- done done done - For me today it's the 'trusting my feelings when I get the 'this person isn't right for me to have intimacy with - also I don't feel so black and white with it now ... I like how p walker talks in his book about the 'reparenting by committee p63 chapter 3 and the 'circle of friends that has varying layers and levels of intimacy .. P64 
984,Quote Arpy ' you are way ahead of me on this one. the biggest step i have taken is to leave behind virtually all my relationships. becos ultimately even the 'good' ones were not helpfuNot sure about the way ahead  ! 💫✨💐 It wasn't that long ago I too left behind virtually all my relationships - I've been pretty reclusive for 2 yrs in this department because I too couldn't trust I would nt keep repeating the pattern - Co dependence is insidious - horrible addiction to have Just last nite another 'friendship ' the one I spoke of at the start of the thread I am going to let go of - But that's recovery ha recognising and letting go - thing is it's easy to go on a personal inner critic downer - but today I'm working to not do that and have a call with my sponsor soon - It's easy to feel hopeless this area I find - as one of the main fruits of life is to have good relationships around us But I can see I'm developing and I do have a hope I didn't have before - I feel too integrated now to keep this pattern repeating I told the universe I'm done - I'm not having it anymore it is time for new more healthy attachment - I do feel stronger and less needy and yes more 'in myself ' It's all possible for us I believe this - Hope on every corner Best wishes 🌸🌞
985,"I am SO SICK of asking, ""are you mad at me?"" ahhh!! I ask my boyfriend all the time. There is like this part of my brain that always thinks people are mad at me! I recently was afraid my doctor was mad at me because he wasn't available, and I asked another doctor to prescribe me a medication. I get afraid of my therapist not thinking much of me at times....But the thing about all this, is that I KNOW that there is no reason for them to be mad/disapproving of me.  My father especially, as well as my mother always had the unrealistic expectations of me, and my father was particularly angry and violent, so I think I developed always seeking approval and being afraid that someone would be mad at me had I not met their expectations.This has been going on for so long, and I have never elaborated it like this. It's so intense, how much I feel it, the tears are starting to pour..Do any of you relate with this (and I am sure some of you do)? "
986,"Ehrmm No, not at all.I never ask if people are angry. Basically my position is: if they are angry, they should tell me. I'm not guessing.I might say: ""boy, do you look/act/behave angry"". But that's rare. Usually they respond they are ""NOT ANGRY!"" anyway, so I've learned to keep my mouth shut.On a more hilarious note: I once had an Italian girlfriend who asked me ""Are you angry?"". ""*?"" I thought, and actually got a bit angry/upset about it.It turned out she had actually asked: ""are you hungry"" (latin languages practically always have the 'silent H', they have difficulty pronouncing it.)  "
987,That's funny Dutch. Thanks for your feedback.  
988,"Sadly, I concur with this 100%. It's like I just assume that other people, anyone, will be negative vis-a-vis anything I do. It's insidious, and the worst, so normal for me. If I don't assume they're mad, it's like they might very well be, any moment, no matter what. Or they'll disapprove of something; if not mad, perhaps recall a time when I fell short of the mark. Or I'll be misunderstood. The list is pretty lengthy...even, let's see, someone calls me and says ""we haven't seen you in a bit, why don't you come over--we need our [my other name] fix."" And I know it doesn't show much here, but people do seem to regard me as a funny sort they enjoy having around, but my suspicion bulb is always lit--nudging me with ""yeah, right, they're just saying that; they're saying what they think you want to hear,"" etc., ad infinitum.I put together an acting gig for a dinner/theater each October. It' a pretty big undertaking, and gets consistent rave reviews from everyone; but afterwards I'm hunting for something, anything, that must have gone wrong, somebody may not have liked, had a problem with that I can assume was my fault. Then the cycle of my mind's swirl turns on me, and I'm so angry at myself, but everybody else loved everything about what I did. Grrrrrrrr.... Oh yeah , it's still that ongoing project--to trust, to feel, to not just be me, but to have the self-compassion that allows me to accept ""me"". And for sure it   me off.So let's start from here as we climb towards that true acceptance of ourselves, maybe even for the first time.  "

990,"""Sadly, I concur with this 100%. It's like I just assume that other people, anyone, will be negative vis-a-vis anything I do. It's insidious, and the worst, so normal for me"" and ""my suspicion bulb is always lit"".Yep.  i guess i just feel (know)that people don't like me and even (especially) if they say they do, that really either they are just saying that, or they may mean it now but soon they will go away from me or turn on me or whatever. as far as angry at me goes, people rarely get that far openly, i think i must be too sycophantic to let it, thanks to growing up with a very short-fused dad, (plus living in a xian cult for years, where openly expressing anger was a no-no).     one person who did was a person i considered for years as a kind of second mum whom i loved very dearly, and she got so angry at me when i left my husband  - more like total, vitriolic character assassination - she told me ""everything you are and everything you do is tainted by soulishness"" (a cult word for selfish, worldly, etc.) i haven't been able to get that barb out of my head since. it is very hard not to believe it when someone you love that much says it. it proves to my crazy mind that i really am irredeemably flawed i guess.that incident was the beginning of the end for me in terms of functioning as a human being and i don't know how to begin to rebuild myself. so i have isolated myself and try to avoid humans if i can. i get very tired of being like this all the time but i don't know how to not be. sorry for the gutspill  "
991,"Wow.This whole question: ""are you angry"" just brought me a EF. (I guess. Still not sure/learning about the concept)I just told that the ""are you (h)angry"" pissed me off, basically.And I suddenly realized that it might well have to do with my (therapist)mother who was is always inquiring/inquisitioning me about ""if I'm OK"" and always then sends me off the deep end, that I'm really not OK, even if I say I am. That my aura is oozing, somewhere, terminally.So I'm not at all prepared for the possibility that if I answer (calmly): ""No. I'm not angry. Peace reigns."" and the other would say: ""Oh, great. Just checking. Lovely."" And all remains as well as it was.No such luck with mom.Thanks. I think this has been a major 'upper' for me.Sorry if this is a threadjack."
992,"hey DutchUncle, "
993,"Yeah, I know you what you mean KayFly. Even with safe people who I know genuinely love and care for me I worry that I'm going to do something to upset them. I'm very unassertive as a result of only meeting my father's needs throughout my childhood/teens and tend to keep my head down everywhere I go. Now I'm getting serious about wanting to recover I'm making a mental note to stop asking people whether they're unhappy with me, as validation should come from myself rather than other people. Love yourself and all that. Funny you mentioned your former colleague, Southbound. My boss once said to me, ""You always look so guilty about something."" At the time it was kind of a kick in the teeth to have someone point it out so brazenly, but now I understand more about what's happened to me I'm starting to see that my instant panic response is not my fault. "
994,"I'm sorry to hear so many of us are affected by this. It's interesting. I can see where it comes from, like you Blues_Cruise. I like the idea of self validation, rather than asking. But sometimes I genuinely don't know. So why can't I ask? I want to know for myself. Maybe next time I will sit on it for a bit before I ask.I feel you Woodsgnome...it is ongoing, and complicated, keep your head up.Thank you for the book suggestion SouthboundAnd thanks everyone for sharing and relating and empathizing. You're all great. I think I would speak more but I am like brain dead and tired."
995,"Haha. Yeah I don't like to give advice unless it's something I follow, or am willing to follow, but ""I love me"" is a good mantra. I also like the ""I'm on my side.""...true that...I have apologized too much in times that I haven't needed to, and because i have recognized this, I am getting much much better about it. I don't find myself apologizing much anymore unless I really have to.Progress is good.."
996,"I figured out that I always feel responsible for everything that goes wrong. I guess after 17 years of being a kid being blamed for every thing that went wrong for my mother its not surprising..""My boss once said to me, ""You always look so guilty about something."""" - the story of my life. Lol If one feels responsible and wears a guilty look it soon becomes easy to pass the blame onto the scape goat. It's hard growing up and nobody trust you, of course it takes years before you can understand why. It's great to know that I am not alone here. It's tiring having to always work against that  though. Difficult to have any self confidence."
997,"Yes I am also asking partners if they are angry about something. I notice as well that because one thinks that one is annoying it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.The hardest thing is working relationships, after about a year I trend to run out of energy, then it seams just a short while before I get a letter from the HR dept. I also seem to attract drama, life can never be straight forward."
998,That might be my biggest problem and it extends to random people
999,"MOST DEFINITELY  !  As someone said in this thread, I guess that happens as a result of being in trouble and always wrong for the first 17 years of your life.  Then, being so comfortable being the pincushion and not knowing any different letting the pattern continue with a boss I worked for over 20 years and in my marriage (yet, he is the porn addict and I am always the one that feels guilty and that I have done something wrong).   I agree with everything that has been said in this thread and can totally relate.  I am always apologizing and taking responsibility for anything that goes wrong even when it really was not in my control.  I have had several people ask, ""what are you apologizing for?"" and also ask ""Why would you think I was mad at you?""  But, I really do not know how to tell when someone is or isn't or know where to draw the line on how much of something I should take responsibility for and what I should not  . And, what about compliments?  Does anyone else struggle with that as well?  I was never allowed to feel good about myself or what I had done for the first 40 years of my life.  Now, I actually have healthy relationships as work with fellow managers and coworkers.  When they try to compliment me, I do not accept them well.  Cannot look them in eyes, always downplaying them, giving credit to everyone else, or just change the subject completely.  I have had several managers call me out on not being able to accept their compliments as well as my T.  My T sets me up once in awhile in a session to see if I have made any improvement in being able to accept and respond to compliments.  I would say not much, still pretty weak in this area too.MaryAnn  "
1000,"Hi all,I am in a bit of a mess and just need some support. I have been with a lady for 6years now. For most of that time I worked away. We have a small boy of two. Being away I only came home for a week every three months but since I lost my job I am here full time.I have CPTSD and am in that decreasing spiral, too many failed opportunities and I have accumulated a bit of debt. Being with my son full time has been beneficial, but it has triggered a lot of memories. I have become really low and have quite a bad preoccupation with death. We live in the same building as her parents who have my son for a few hours each day I have never been on great terms with her mother and I just blew up at her father a week ago. This all doesn't appear very attractive to my SO and I have tried to get her to understand CPTSD.she is not interested in helping me, she read some of the bloom paper and told me it was too difficult to understand. She will not engage in any kind of discussion about it.She has become cold and has pretty much indicated that she would rather I was not here. This triggers all my abandonment fears and makes me even more down.I would get out but I have no money and nowhere to go, so I must try to stay until I have work again. I have spent the last few months with my son and now have a strong bond that I don't want to break.I try not to engage in end of the relationship chats I have been through this before, I always find myself with women who turn out to be cold and unable to love, so by the age of 48 I guess I have it nailed! I am not in my home country,  I have no friends here and feel like every one is ganging up on me. I am also being denied the opportunity to explain why I am the way I am.I can see that I am being scapegoated, but there is no way to talk about what is going on. I have tried but clearly I am crazy. The trouble is their denial is triggering me and I need to run."
1001,"Hi steamy  Yep, that's a tough spot to be in. As a long time bachelor I can't give you much solid advice.But I can say you are an OK man.  Loosing a job is depressing, I can relate to that. I'm in the same boat.And suddenly living with your wife and kid is a big change, for all three of you. It takes time to adept.It's a pity cPTSD is not a subject the can be discussed. It leaves you alone to fend with it. Well, not alone, you have us.  She tried though, but it's way over her head. Well, don't we all feel it's way over our head? It's even way over many T's heads, is what I have gathered from the experiences shared here on the forum.I suggest you try to drop the cPTSD ball with her. That must be hard for you, but unfortunately that ship is not sailing.It's wonderful though that you have bonded with your son, and possibly continuing on that avenue, with your wife, will make things a bit easier.You haven't shared what the ""blow-up"" with your father-in-law was (and you don't have to!) but a blow up now and then is OK. It happens. You're under a lot of stress, perhaps FIL is too.If you feel it's appropriate to apologize to him, do so. If not, don't.If possible, find a volunteer job. Something to keep you occupied, you might also meet some people that way, make acquaintances, perhaps friends even. Any 'cultural center' or so relating to your home country/nationality? Do you play outside with your son? Playing grounds can be great to make some contact as well. You must have plenty to chat about regarding witnessing a small child growing up. Shared experiences make for great bonds.I hope and wish things will get better for you.  And remember, baby steps for you too!  "
1002,"Thanks Dutch Uncle, I agree adjusting takes time.I take him to the forest and the church nearby has swings and a slide that we use but i never see anybody. I have tried to get my SO to find a toddler group that we could go to as he is autistic and could do with the social interaction.I blew up at my father in law because he always destroys my efforts. I am a keen gardener and have spent weeks working in the garden, I have planted a number of shrubs and created kitchen garden. Everything has been destroyed. I either find that he has simply pulled them up or he will put objects  such as planks of wood on the plants, crushing them. He recently allowed the neighbour to build a wall and didn't get them to make good, the topsoil was gone leaving clay and stones, and bare earth where there was lawn. I had vowed never to touch the garden again except I wanted an area for my son to play. So a couple of months ago I weeded and seeded an area behind the house. I went out and found that he had put piles of wood on the grass completely avoiding the concrete area. I now believe he does it consciously or sub consciously as a means of having power, passive aggression.Everybody then gang up to make me feel bad for objecting. Its not my house or garden and yes they can do what they  want with it. I don't understand why anybody would chose to live in a place which has so much potential but never do a stroke to keep it tidy.A few times they have ""lost"" my son, they were supposed to be looking after him, he comes to me and a few minutes later they come looking. I get upset because he managed to open their front door and climb stairs on his own before anybody realises he's gone. Soon he will want to explore the street. It happens once every two weeks. They wonder why I am touchy. My beef is that they are not engaging with him and simply putting him infront of the TV.I agree that cptsd is over peoples heads, conventionally, we get judged on our personality, although folks will agree that we are the products of our experience, they can't figure that negative experiences have negative effects on us."
1003,"Good grief, steamy…FiL...  I guess apologizing is out of the question.     What an  I would  too! Destroying your work in the garden… Does this man have PTSD? (or MiL for that matter? I ask because of your place of residence) How did they survive the war? (possibly not the best subject to bring up with them… I'm just curious.)Good grief, once again.

Never mind they don't do anything, destroying the work you have done is way out of line. Especially from FiL. And if you are living in with them, it IS your garden as well, IMHO. But obviously my opinion is of little concern to them.QuoteA few times they have ""lost"" my son, they were supposed to be looking after him, he comes to me and a few minutes later they come looking.

They wonder why I am touchy.For what it's worth, I don't wonder at ALL why you are touchy. Good of/for you to take a stand there. You're the primary care-giver here. If MiL and FiL are acting irresponsible towards your kid, you are damned right to have an issue with that. What's your wife's take on this? Forget about the garden for a moment, but this is her child too. She really should show concern about this. Does she? I hope she does. She should be on your* side in this. Not on her parents side.Though that might be easier said than done. Do you two talk about these matters?*) read: her kid's side <--- and possibly you need to point that out: it's not about taking your side, but her kid's side, just as you are on your kid's side, not ""against her parents"". I hope she can recognize that.QuoteI take him to the forest and the church nearby has swings and a slide that we use but i never see anybody.

Tough.I agree it's important to give your son the attention regarding autism that he needs. I assume he has an official diagnosis? Does the healthcare-system over there provide for anything? Primarily meaning: they have specialized care available for him?I have a dad whom I suspect to be Asperger's so I somewhat relate. (He's not diagnosed, in fact how could he have been? Asperger's only ""in view"" for one or two decades now, so of course it was missed. (and it's just my amateur diagnosis anyway))Perhaps reading up on autism can give you some time ""off"" from the stress of cPTSD and the ""extended family business"". I must say I found it quite interesting to read about Asperger's, and I have the distinct feeling that my understanding of it has improved in some ways my interactions with dad. Even though it stays awkward. But I suspect that with your son and the 'early detection' things can and will be a lot more positive.What does your wife think of son's autism? How does she cope? It must be hard on a mother too to have a son/child that regularly doesn't respond/react like 'all the other kids do'.Well, there's a whole post again of Mr. Bachelor with-no-kids-himself.  Take care. As you already do.  "
1004,"Yeah a lot of stuff here lol.The war didn't affect Zagreb much, the Serbs only tried to bomb the TV mast apparently. It was much worse to the south and east. It was a great observation of yours as I often joke that I am turning into him. He's an intelligent guy but I don't think he had a job since the destruction of Yugoslavia and the introduction of the ""free market"". So yes I think he has CPTSD too.My son has had an official diagnosis, he is what they call hyposensitive, he takes anti convulsant drugs for epilepsy which I think probably contribute to his numbness.I have read a fair bit on autism, we take him to therapy 4x per week, the Croats are pretty good in that respect even though i suspect the government therapists are less than motivated.We don't talk much about these things despite my attempts to get her to open up, she did say that the autism is a stress factor, I also think that it has escalated my symptoms too. She does put a lot of effort into our son although then has crazy teenage fits too. ""My mash is too hard, she doesnt like poatoes now afterall and didn't i know she wont drink cold milk!"" Living at home for 40 years means you don't grow up fully and develop your own sense of self. She has a lot of work to do there and I doubt looking at her mum (60 odd years in the same house) that she will.I have a couple of job applications in, one I put the wrong job title down, lol, that's what we CPTSDers do! The other is only short term but the organisation have a million preferences such as being fluent in French, experienced in carrying out component studies and being based in the UK even though the job is in Burundi.... I barely meet 1 of those criteria but given that there are only a few hundred prosthetist in the UK I doubt if anybody there is without a job and meets their silly criteria."
1005,"I'm only recently coming to terms with the fact that I seem to have C-PTSD. I fit the criteria pretty much perfectly and I've had the life experience to back that up. I knew I had social anxiety but now I understand more what it's rooted in.I don't want to be this way anymore. I want to recover because it's so, so lonely when you can't fit in with people and make new friends. I believe people hate me and think I'm a weirdo / freak when they don't. Like my social anxiety keeps getting proven wrong recently because these people don't hate me and they keep showing that, but I've had so many bad experiences what with bullying and abuse that it's like I have a default understanding of what people think of me.Even when people prove they don't hate me it doesn't take long till my head is back to finding reasons why they must. I want to get better. I want to stop feeling like I'm separated from other people by this thick veil. I want to make connections and not be sitting wanting to die every day I go to work because I can't handle the pressure that the need to socialise brings. I want to make new friends and be happy.My life isn't really that bad, it's actually really pretty good now! But I'm struggling so much to enjoy it because of the way my past has affected me.I haven't told my doctor that I think I have PTSD. I'm not sure they'll be much use because they're usually not too urgent (like I've told them I'm suicidal and all that's happened is I've been given pills and a charity counselling number?) So idk what to do.I just don't want to be isolating myself from other people forever.I have this strong desire to connect to other people. I feel truly happy when I begin to be able to but it tends not to last because of anxiety taking over. Will I be this way forever? What can I do to make it better? I just want to be able to talk to people without the terror of thinking they will hate me / I'll * up and my body shaking, heart racing etc. Social anxiety sucks."
1006,"Hi Samantha19  It's a tough road we're on, but I'm so happy you joined up.Yep, ( c)PTSD does this to us. Can't feel happy when all is OK… ""Where is the bloody PROBLEM ? I know there is going to be ONE !!! Where the bloody * is it? Hmmm, now?! Own up!!!""Welcome, and I hope you'll stick around. It takes time to accept there isn't a problem. Around here a problem isn't even a problem. We're all in the same boat. A 'love' boat. "
1007,"Hi,I have social anxiety too which drives me crazy because I am not an introvert (everybody labels me as this because of my anxiety and because I self isolate when I'm depressed). I do have friends and a job regardless and I'm pretty proud of myself for that and you should be too! The fact that you have connections when you have social anxiety is awesome because u really are facing your fears daily.I totally get it though, for me the friendships I have aren't satisfying only because I can't connect with them on a deeper level, my friendships and relationships are all surface level.I started out doing a 20 week cbt program from the social anxiety institute and it was absolutely awesome but I stopped because I have other issues I want to work out first. It costs around $250 (which is cheap because if u saw a therapist it would be that price per session) and the guy that designed the program is an ex sufferer himself. It's an audio program and you can download it online, it's had the best reviews I've seen yet for social anxiety.I have decided to do schema therapy first though which changes core beliefs. One of my main core beliefs is defectiveness/shame so I am really keen to get that sorted first because I think it is key to me recovering from social anxiety. I plan to pick that therapy back up when I finish my schema program.For you, I'm no therapist but I think it's important to heal some other things first before you try and cure your social anxiety. If u are hypersensitive to critisism or you fear intimacy, it's going to be extra hard for you to start putting yourself out there socially without wanting to crawl back into a hole. Social anxiety can be cured though and only you yourself will know when your ready to start a treatment program, but cbt is the best thing for it and the social anxiety institute is brilliant and I couldn't recommend it more! You've got this. You can do it "
1008,"Samantha19,I too often feel like, nice as people are, the other shoe is bound to fall. Maybe they'll freak that I like green and they like red, it can be as simple and stupid as that. I never give myself the benefit of the doubt; they're right, I'm wrong, I run from fear that I'll hurt their feelings even more when they find out I don't always like yellow, either.It's as you say, mostly a habit. But it's pernicious in its staying power. I have no sure-fire answers, per usual. But I have tried something that sometimes helps; and feel bad when I forget it—but I'm always looking for reasons to beat myself up (another habit...sigh).I'm pretty much retired now, but I used to be an actor, amongst other jobs (all of them involving people-contact, surprisingly). One day, anxious as usual before a performance, I started just to silently say “peace” on the in-breath; and “love” on the exhale. Sometimes I'd reverse the order; what seemed to matter more wasn't any precise order, just that I put those two words in play. It seemed to diminish the fear somewhat, at least for that while, but it was what I needed when I needed it. So maybe next time you can try that? As another saying I ran across once puts it, try “playing with options”. Actually, I think the playing part serves us better than calling everything work or technique. Playing, even as just a word, has a better feel for me, anyway. Peace/love;love/peace. Play with options."
1009,"Hi everyone,thanks for your kind replies. It does help to know you're not alone.I completely identify with that, Laynelove! I honestly think I'm an extrovert, something I've recently realised, as when I actually interact with people my depression seems to shift and I am really happy! But most of the time I'm, like, drowning in social anxiety so I come across as an introvert and I used to believe that I was one. If it wasn't for social anxiety though, I do think I'd be an extroverted person.Yeah, I've been doing CBT as well and it's pretty good, it's just I also feel my problems might be more deeply rooted than that. It really is my core beliefs that are flawed as I think when I was developing my self esteem and self image were just under such attack that I took that in and it shaped my core beliefs. So yeah, I'll have a look into schema therapy, thank you  And I know exactly what you mean woodsgnome. It's so silly but it's hard to force yourself to see past it. I always think if people don't already hate me they're going to start to soon. It's like I'm waiting on it to happen. It's dreadful because I know on some level that people are generally nice and friendly and have no reason to dislike you so long as you are nice and friendly too. But still, the feeling persists on being there. It's a major pain in the *!Also, the breathing in and out thing really helps me too.  I do one that goes ""In, out, present moment, wonderful moment."" I got it from a bhuddist book and it actually really works for me. Things like that are brilliant for focusing on the present moment and calming down. I'll give the peace, love one a try too Thanks again everyone <3 Good long in your own journeys!  "
1010,"I ended a fifteen year relationship over the holidays last year.  I was tired of being hated by him.  The relationship was toxic at best and brought out the worst in me due, in part, to my CPTSD.  I moved out of the city and into the suburbs so I wouldn't have to see him.  Almost all of my friends are friends with him also.  I avoid them because I do not feel safe with them.  He's with the person he was cheating on me with.  It hurts to hear anything about them.I was bullied as a child for many years and my dad, who is a Baptist minister, preached of an angry god who was going to send me to *.  I believed every word my dad spoke and grew up hated by my peers and hated by god and terrified of being sent to *.  I'll be 50 next month and I'm still choosing cold hearted, emotionally unavailable people to have relationships with.  I want to be happy.  I want to meet people and have fun.  But I'm terrified of life.  "
1011,"i am so sorry you are in pain   . it's so hard to feel unloved, even if the relationship was toxic to you and keyed into all that bad stuff from your upbringing - it doesn't make it easier does it?  but try to not lose heart, glbreed, nurture the possibility of change and growth in yourself. it isn't easy, but even just taking a tiny step is an achievement.loads of support to you p.s. i know what you mean about 'angry god'.  a vicar once said to me when i expressed similar sentiments, ' i'm glad i don't believe in your god, because he's a psychopath!' yup, his god was much certainly nicer than the one i was taught.

1013,"QuoteI'll be 50 next month and I'm still choosing cold hearted, emotionally unavailable people to have relationships with.  I want to be happy.  I want to meet people and have fun.  But I'm terrified of life.I ended a 25 yr relationship a few years back and dove right into another relationship where ""cold hearted, emotionally unavailable"" is at the forefront of my feelings about it so I get this.  Someone on this site said to me a few days back (paraphrasing here) that wherever I am with myself is what I will attract into my life. And she's right; If I want better relationships with others, I must first have a better relationship with myself. In my opinion, (I am just starting my journey with CPTSD) that means I have to be more available to the process of growing out of isolation, out of pain - out of the terrifying place; I must become more aware of my feelings, more aware of how I act/react and make a sincere effort toward taking action with whatever it is I need to do.Of course, just acknowledging that this is the beginning of the journey IS taking action; I have always known that (for me) awareness is half the battle.The ""more active part"" if you will, is reading Pete Walker's book CPTSD From Surviving To Thriving along with reading/sharing here on this site; both are tremendously affirming and supportive.These are the small steps I am taking in terms of action; in doing so, the vulnerability I experience quite often is excruciatingly painful but I am changing so I know it's OK. I know if I stay with it, I will find more to do as my growth permits.glbreed, I'm glad you are here. I hope you find some comfort knowing that their are others who identify with your feelings.Welcome."
1014,Thanks everyone for your words of encouragement.  It means a lot to me and I am grateful.  
1015,"Hi, glbreed...I've been on a ride resembling yours, especially the early stuff, it appears, the hypocrisy of the bigoted hateful misfired mixed-up posers who pretended they're in tune with a deity and by g they'll gladly share the good news of love as soon as you shut up and obey the only way. You know the rest.What I ended up learning best, was that life involves a whole lot of unlearning. It's pretty unfair, and accepting it is one of the hardships of following the unlearning curriculum. Stepping past and out of the dung left from the ugly past is pretty hard but we pluck along.""Isolation"" is my middle name; maybe it should be my primary one. Partly chosen, I've been fortunate enough to have physically isolated myself from it, but the inner hurt never leaves. Still unlearning, maybe accepting more, but never retreating from the recovery journey.I hope you can find some means to stay on your path out of what you described. Wish I could say it's easy, but I gave up hypocrisy back then, too. Look around--we're feeling your pain even as we seek to live with ours. Good to see you here."

[/quote]Sounds like some of my issues.    * is created for us, I think.  Religion gave us duality...good and bad.  But nature is much more complex, and we are learning about complexity.  Perception is reality, some say.  I have striven to see ""what is"": a truth seeker.  With profound and uncomfortable questions.  I am over 50.  Introverted by nature and nurture, set apart.  Apart is not aside. Though it feels that way.  We have been expressing the pain of the clear seeing child within.  That child is actually telling us we are worthy of life.  By sending the pain of what has been done to us, and protesting everything that wants to blame what is on their heads and hands, even if they are in denial, they know the truth.We are, I think in a resolution of self, finding our true selves, and learning how to be hyperpresent in the now, or free of our pasts, but not of some long gathered wisdom from less than ideal things in life.   You are strong, and it is not any of our responsibility, what others do or have done.  You recognized a predictor! You protected yourself, more important, you protected your true self. That says you are healing, growing, and at least learning who needs to be passed up, for someone better. I think, we need to resolve. The religious thing, the burden of guilt we bear, and is projected on us, or maybe we felt our abusers guilt, and mistakenly believed it was ours.  This is the only sense I can make of illogical feelings.  Certainly, I would be prompted to comfort a child in distress.  It seems adults do not notice such things, they are not fully present, like a child is, taking in every detail that is new to them, without judgement of good and bad.  That was why Jesus said the children shall lead.  Our divine children, within."
1017,"Hi glbreed,Like Woodsgnome and EmoVulcan, my early years were much the same as yours. My parents were and still are strict Southern Baptists.  My father was controlling, oppressive, abusive, and a narcissist.  I have no doubt that he is a uNPD, malignant type.  He used his God to control and shame me from as early as I can remember.  I was beat with belt on a daily basis for defying him for things like not eating everything on my plate, or appreciating everything that was cooked and not be willing to try beets, okra, black eyed peas, anything seen as disobedient.  If you shed a tear, my parents were the type that said, Shut up or I will really give you something to cry about.... Or Keep it Up, no one hears and no cares. Eat them or you will never leave this table!  And that was just what happened at the dinner table.  I learned how to disassociate very young.  I was expected to be like Jesus and put everyone else's wants and needs ahead of my own.  If I wanted for anything, I was being selfish and unappreciative.  As a teenager, I made the same mistakes of any teenager, but in my house these were unforgiveable indiscretions.  My father made it clear that I was going to *, it didn't matter what I did from that point on, I could not be forgiven.  I had committed the ultimate betrayal of not honoring my mother and father.  It was his job to control my every thought and action and that I had failed him.  I was looking for a rescuer, thought it was the man that then became my husband, only to realize that I married a hybrid of my mother and father.  I put myself in the same situation all over again.  Quote.....I'm still choosing cold hearted, emotionally unavailable people to have relationships with.  I want to be happy.  I want to meet people and have fun.  But I'm terrified of life. This is me, be it friends, bosses, I know how to pick the ones that will abuse me most.  Happiness and unconditional love are all I really want, need.  Shame is the driver of my fears. Fear controls me.  If I am not pleasing and doing for everyone else, then I will never be worthy of happiness or love.I recently discovered that as much as I thought that I had forgiven my father, accepted that he could not change, and simply did not have any feelings for him at all, that he is still controlling my every decision.  I fear his retribution on my mother and my brother if I do anything he doesn't approve of like getting a divorce, joining a humanist group (I am agnostic but have never told him), writing a book, participating in causes to support issues he is against.  He is still controlling me and I never even see or talk to him.  I am afraid to live and be how I want.   The worst part is that I now realize that Shame is intrinsic to my character, my personality as a result of how they treated and raised me as parents.  I react to everything from a sense of shame. It is part of the foundation that the rest of my self was built on.  Unlearning that is going to be a rough ride.  As part of my foundation, it is going to be tricky to correct without the whole house falling down.....  Glad you found us glbreed. It is nice to have others that we can relate to, support, and walk with in our journey's to self recovery.MaryAnn "
1018,"Working on my recovery for CPSD. I have encountered a recently issue that really left me rattled.We are all familiar with being profoundly influenced by behavior towards us by people who don't have our best interest at heart.Recently met someone who presented as someone balanced, smart, open. I let down my guard, just a little bit, and wham. Next thing I know I've got a covert psyco on my hands trying to manipulate me and projecting their bad behavior on me. We have all encountered a similar situation before. But this time things were handled differently by me...As soon as the manipulations started and the twisting of words and the attempt at trying to guilt me started, I tapped into the old familiar feeling of being a dependent, helpless kid again. I was determined not to let this continue. It was a real shocker to the predator as they did not expect me to become aware nor have the skills to walk away from the situation.What really helped me in this new relationship was that I was no longer that helpless dependent child. I am now an adult. Capable of accessing the situation, and shutting the predator down. Yeah, my vulnerabilities were targeted, and yeah, everything was turned around and projected back onto me. It always hurts when that happens even though we know what's going on. I'd rather a predator show me their true colors early on so it can be delt with as soon as possible than doubt myself and allow the manipulations continue.I stopped a predator dead in their tracks today. Am I shaking, upset, angry and shaking in my own skin right now? Heck yeah I am. But as unpleasant the feelings come into my awareness, I'd rather deal with some pain now and reclaim myself, rather than not listening to my gut and having the torture go on and on, eroding everything new I have learned, I'm sticking to my guns. I've stopped the continuation of being a victim. I've stood up for myself.I'm not asking for you all to fix my feelings, only time and compassion for myself will heal me. But I really wanted to share this with you all. That we can stand up and say ""no, the buck stops here"", do what you want, say what you want, I will not budge from my convictions. This doesn't mean I won't have some strong, unpleasant emotions, it means that I've disengaged so I can start to heal.I really wish that standing up for ourselves will bring immediate relief once we have recognized the problem and deal with it, it just doesn't work that way. We have to reclaim and love ourselves enough to go through a small amount of pain, instead of jumping back into the frying pan of emotional * and having our spirits torn apart once again.I have worked too hard to let this happen again.Could use some support, but ultimately, it's up to me to ask you all for the support that you can offer to me. I hanging on here, knowing that each second is one second closer to regaining my self-esteem, therefore allowing me to get on with the business of living and keeping that positive support around me.I take solace in the knowledge that a predator came into my life, saw the goodness in me, thought they could exploit me and came away dead wrong. So I took action to let them know, I'm not the doormat I appear to be just because I showed my open and vulnerable side...knowing that I probably surprised the predator and oh would I have liked to have been a fly on that wall to watch his own undoing slam right into his own face.Who's with me?"
1019,"Wow! Thank you for showing the way, CPTSDchild. And yes, I'm with you, as I'm sure we all are.It takes so much fortitude to endure some of the slop people try to lay at the feet of someone they'd rather intimidate, humiliate, and shame with their false notions of superiority. As if we are so weak by virtue of having endured some awful circumstances that we fell victim to through no fault of our own.I've been in that position, too. Run into someone who seems like they can be trusted, then they try and turn the tables on you, often starting with fake sympathy which quickly turns to blame. So often I just turn away, afraid of my own anger at having to explain and afraid of losing it entirely, which only reinforces their contempt. Then they try and explain your whole life for you, how you don't live in reality, should just get over it, etc. Yet you, CPTSDchild, found the strength to say enough is enough. Trouble is, it's natural to want to reach out, to find understanding. Like you say, one's best healing comes from within, but it sure helps to have someone to support you, and not have to wonder if they'll turn on you just because you admit that, yeah, it's scary and it hurts, a lot. To show that it's not weakness to feel that way; just honest.You summed it nicely by saying, ""We have to reclaim and love ourselves enough to go through a small amount of pain, instead of jumping back into the frying pan of emotional * and having our spirits torn apart once again.""Thanks again.  "
1020,"I have to agree, being aware of the warning signs of being used and abused definitely is an upside to CPTSD.  I had the same experience with a guy back a few years ago when I was trying to date. He came across like the greatest guy in the world ... but I recognized those little cracks. I think I shocked him when he tried to sucker me into feeling sorry for him and I called his bluff. I have to admit, it felt good to stop that particular sort of monster in his tracks.As for reaching out, it's hard to reach out. Some days I feel like all I attract are psychos for 'friends' and dates. I keep trying, though, when I can. I have a couple really, really, really good friends who I've known forever and I know I can trust. It was hard to find them, it's going to be hard to find trustworthy people in the future too, but I think they're worth sorting through the chaff for. "
1021,"CPTSDChild - WOW!!! wow, what can i say? i am gobsmacked and full of respect and esteem for what you managed to do. support you? too right, and follow, hopefully, some of what you modelled there. it speaks right  into my deep fear of standing up for myself, so i can only guess what it cost to do it, and the triggers that it set off. but as i say, big respect, and i hope you are feeling, once the painful storm settles a bit, like you really achieved something great.  Quote ""We have to reclaim and love ourselves enough to go through a small amount of pain, instead of jumping back into the frying pan of emotional * and having our spirits torn apart once again."" i love this, i might need to put this up somewhere.  thanks for sharing, C-Child, loads of kudos and support   "
1022,"Wow! CPTSDChild! That was awesome!   Fantastic job!  You made such good points about trusting our guts, and being will to face a (relatively) small amount of pain and discomfort in the short run in order to protect ourselves against predators who would cause us huge amounts of pain and discomfort in the long run.I am with you. Thank you too. By the synchronicity of the Universe, at my last appointment with my T I had a 'buck stops here', 'I am done with all of this BS' discussion. Thank you for posting this success story. It is empowering to decide to fully protect oneself, but somewhat scary too. I really appreciate that you posted your story for inspiration. I will draw from that good energy and the good tips when faced with predators in my life  "
1023,"Hi again guys,I work, go to school, intern, etc. I'm around people often, but never feel closer to them and though sometimes i feel lonely i never want to spend time with people. After months of hanging around someone and spending time together I have no greater desire to see them than I do any other stranger. How do I actually begin enjoying really connecting and wanting to reach out. I do reach out and pursue my ""goals"" because mentally i know i should but there's no real joy in it for me.Has anyone else experienced or overcome this?"
1024,"I live with this people-fear constantly--yet I too held mostly people-oriented positions. I can recall two periods when I felt comfortable enough to where I actually felt at ease with the situation--when I worked in hospice/end of life settings and when I was involved with pre-school kids in the program called Head Start.The common denominator for me, I think, was that in those roles I didn't feel judged, or maybe it's more the fear of being judged was erased by serving a greater need. I fell into each of those experiences. I'd love to find another outlet like them, but the circumstances of how they came about were unique and aren't an option for me right now. Like you, I've reached a level where being alone is okay, too. I'm not actively looking, but I kinda wish for it all the same. Mine is a classic ""freeze"" reaction to cptsd, per Walker.So that was my way, for a while. Not desperately seeking another outlet, but who knows? I'm not sure I consider it something to overcome, but if another opportunity arose where I could just be and share myself again, I might give it a shot. I'm still cautious with people, for good or ill, but at least I had the chance to feel safe at loving and being loved.I hope you can find a balance in your life between alone and with people you can feel comfortable with.   "
1025,"Hi annbelievesinwhalesI cant believe you feel the same way I do!!I have began to think there may be something wrong with me- but i guess its cptsd related, ive never discounted that possibility.Im sorry i dont have any answers, only similar experience.I have lost joy in spending time with others too.I do feel lonely, bored etc. in others company, but cant be with others, because it is triggering, but the thought of being with others sometimes makes me panic.I do find it boring being with most people, and I think its because i can not share any aspect of myself.People want to feel connected and that involves an equal relationship on both ends. People can not appreciate me if they dont know what there is to appreciate. There may be nothing...but i hope you know what i mean.I am always listening to others ...its always about them. I dont like attention, but I just get bored listening all the time.I am also a freaze type. Cautious and untrusting of others. I think currently and have for a long time, that people suck.I know its not helpful me saying that. I hope you can find a balance too."
1026,"THE SAME!I reach out to people because I know it's good for my mental health but most of the world is like it's not there, like it could be there or not and I wouldn't care.People wouldn't understand as I can seem bubbly, outgoing and friendly and have a well tailored persona to expose when socialising but the world is so blank and meaningless.Perhaps because I carried lies and was taught to hide so well I am now having to rebuild what life is about but the first step is to find healthy so I try not to think about how disfunctional it is to feel only numbness against the world and the people in it. One step at a time..."
1027,"Boy I feel that way.The only time I feel as though I am comfortable with people is when I'm at work. I'm a nurse and I like talking to my patients. I'm not aware of the pain or fear. I don't feel as though I have to open up. I'm happy focusing on the person.I know I'm suppose to feel as though I want to be around others. The problem is I feel too needy. I feel afraid. If someone yells at me, I freeze. People think I'm an idiot. I can hear them talk about me. (no it's not paranoia). Nurses are mean to each other."
1028,agreed 
1029,I have the same experience.Ironically when I meet people I connect with I find I give them the space I would expect for myself and they think I am being distant.I can't live in the pockets of others. Friendships Soon dissolve.
1030,"Hi Ann - Quote from: annbelievesinwhales on July 19, 2015, 03:02:56 PMI work, go to school, intern, etc. I'm around people often, but never feel closer to them and though sometimes i feel lonely i never want to spend time with people. After months of hanging around someone and spending time together I have no greater desire to see them than I do any other stranger. How do I actually begin enjoying really connecting and wanting to reach out. I do reach out and pursue my ""goals"" because mentally i know i should but there's no real joy in it for me.Has anyone else experienced or overcome this?Lord yes lol!  After everything we have been through I don't think being emotionally distant from others is a surprising outcome.  The numbing, the unwillingness to allow ourselves to attach to anyone, to feel anything makes perfect sense.  If we don't allow ourselves to feel anything towards others we can't be hurt.  It's what we had to do to protect ourselves as children when those who were supposed to love us abused us instead.  And it worked, we survived. FWIW, as I recover and get more and more of the pain out and processed, there is more room and energy for others, more of a desire to connect, and thankfully a lessening fear of being hurt because I am learning to protect myself in more appropriate ways.  Hope some small part of this helps  "
1031,Ann b in whales It never ceases to amaze me how much identification I get here....Yes !!I 'checked out ' for a couple of yrs re social life ( not completely but didn't really Persue making friends etc - wasn't bothered - preferred my own company The past few mths ( since working with therapist ....I have found a shift - I want to be around people more though I still feel uncomfortable and find eye contact hard .. But the progression is I do now share about myself and feel more equal in how I relate .. It feels a lot about emotional boundaries - before they were so poor I lost myself to others - How do u enjoy connecting and reaching out - I can only give my own experience in that it has been about my self development as I've felt some more integration I have started opening up to life more - Maybe it's not so much about enjoying it at first ? But practicing in timed ways and reflecting on what the thoughts were whilst doing it ... We are social animals by default and I'm learning just how much people do trust and explore with each other - healing through relationship - The more I focus on me and not necessarily them the better - Fear is a big one for me and my thinking is distorted - I very much come with a black and white attitude to life and it seems about learning that middle ground Maybe find a hobby that u enjoy and meet people with an activity between u - I joined a walking group and it sure takes some of the despondency and fear out of relating Wishing u all the best 
1032,"Triggerd 2 I work as a nurse also and relate to what u say 'I'm not aware of the pain or fear ' yes when I am with a patient because it is one sided and a service - 'i' am not in the equation so much ' . That gets me to think that the aim of healthy functioning in relating may be down to me not being so absorbed in me - more about the sharing and less focus and hypervigelence on 'me' That said I'm not there yet I am just learning how to practice more balanced sharing - how to work with my energetics and be in my own body with a sense of protection and how to be honest eg if I feel shy I am shy - not I feel shy and I pretend to be confident - Learning how to be authentic and not self beat because I'm less than perfect is very important for me as a sufferer of cptsd Yes I am just learning I'm a freeze type too - esp if someone is too dominant / talkative / lacks boundaries - I go like a rabbit in head lights ... My default setting is to go quiet and give up - I'm learning to be more myself - if I don't feel comfortable sharing with someone ( which happens a fair bit , and I'm sure happens to others who don't have cptsd ) then I am learning to share for myself..This week I am seeing that I give others too much power / attention /focus and what I'd be best to do is give that to me - Always afraid of what others think / their opinions and general personality ... Relating feels like playing a game and learning the rules ... I can see that the problems come from that lack of early attachment and retreat into self / not learning those social skills and becoming early on afraid of people - But time is changing I can't live locked in that fear and hide now - For me now it's about facing that fear and all the accompanying thoughts / attitudes and working with it - of course it requires support I can't do this stuff on my ownAnd just to finish yes ! Care staff can and are bloody awful - those environments are full of co dependants and all the behaviours that go with that - talking about others behind their backs / lack of assertiveness / all or nothing thinking / not taking care of self / lack of boundaries It's toxic The only thing I can do is look after me - I too have had a long history with codependence ( the silent killer ) and I had to work through a lot of guilt in order to start focusing on my self ( and still a work in progress ) but I know today that when I keep my energy in the right places I feel so much better - learning to be assertively kind is proving very beneficial - people really do have more respect for it "
1033,"Kizzie, what you wrote makes a whole load of sense and is helpful.I am glad you are feeling that there is more room for others now that you are letting some of that pain out.How amazing.I did turn off my feelings for my parents and mu sister.I feel nothing but anger and indifference for my mum.You helped me to realise that i did not let myself feel attached and maybe not just because i found my mother infuriating and annoying but because they had no love to give.This works with others too.How nice it would be to find true people as in friends, that accept you and where a healthy relationship can be had."
1034,"Glad it helped Indigo   I was just rereading Pete Walker's four trauma types and he has them grouped under a section ""CPTSD as an Attachment Disorder""  which speaks volumes to why we have difficulties with relationships.  QuotePolarization to a fight, flight, freeze or fawn response is not only the developing child's unconscious attempt to obviate danger, but also a strategy to purchase some illusion or modicum of attachment. All 4F types are commonly ambivalent about real intimacy because deep relating so easily triggers them into painful emotional flashbacks   Reference: http://pete-walker.com/fourFs_TraumaTypologyComplexPTSD.htmOther than my H and S, most of my attachments have been illusory, lightweight  and as he suggests, because I was so easily triggered by any hint of rejection, anger or by someone who seemed in any way needy/demanding.  Those fears seem to be diminishing as I recover fortunately.The other reason was not wanting anyone to see what I used to think of as the  'defective' part of me that has EFs and is not always rational and adult. Knowing now that I have a disorder or psychological injury rather than a defect of character, does make it easier and yet I  still hold back from a deeper level of intimacy. I am letting people closer than ever before, but I am just not certain about whether and how to achieve that deeper level without revealing what I have been through.  It is not easily discussed and not with just anyone.  So far this forum is really the only place other than therapy and with my H that I am open and that's because it's anonymous.  I feel like I am connecting in one sense, but it's a bit of an illusion or a modicum in another because we don't know one another IRL. "
1035,"I had 3 clients today.  I am more exhausted than I can explain. I have spent days cleaning and doing heavy yardwork for 12 hours or more, straight, without getting tired at all, but talking to human beings has drained me.  I thought that seeing people one at a time would be easier than crowds.  But they are both draining.  I feel a general connection to humanity because I understand people and I understand the individuals that come my way.  But I don't want to spend time with them.  Especially if they seem the slightest bit critical or if I imagine they might be.  That just makes me think, why did I bother giving you my time if you don't even appreciate me; being around you was a monumental task for me and you kind of have to love it and need it otherwise why should I put the stress on myself.  Honestly, at this point I don't care and if I don't connect to individuals I won't mind.  But I have to pay my bills so I guess it has to happen. and when it's good it's great but it takes a lot of ego stroking for me to believe someone likes me. I don't think I'm going to get over it. I'm not trying to be a downer but I believe that based on experience in a lot of therapy so my strategy is to figure out how to survive in spite of it.  "
1036,"i really understand that, Kizzie.  this forum is at present the only contact i have with anyone except my kids. and certainly the only place where i can feel safe enough to share in any way, precisely becos of the anonymity, as you say. being alone is all new territory for me becos i have always been very social (the upside of living in a xian community for 15 yrs before i left and got married, had family etc.)  i always considered i was quite good at relationships, and in a way i was.  but the  final 'betrayal' in the cult a couple of years back plus a sexual assault by someone in the church i went to next, and then an episode of sexual harassment at work and i suddenly just felt i was not safe anywhere. so i have self-isolated as completely as i can.  i know it's not healthy in the long term but it's the best i can do in order to survive at the moment. the thought of re-engaging with people actually sets off very upsetting EFs if i am not very careful. happened this afternoon when i had a missed call on my phone from a lady (a nice one) who i used to know in the cult. i didn't ring her back, but it really scared me. and then i felt guilty becos she obviously meant well, then, well you know how it goes.  i can't bear being anywhere near anyone in or connected with the cult, and i don't have any relationships really that don't come under that heading.  the fear and the feeling of nowhere being safe for me is too much to tackle at the moment.  i am just hoping that if i keep working on what i can manage to tackle, the rest will somehow follow.  "

I also isolated myself because I couldn't bear to be around anyone and it gave me the space I needed to stay inside my skin long enough to get to know myself better.  When I was around people I was always pulled out of myself, focused on them and meeting their needs.  I figured out that I was trained to be ""other-referencing"" by covert NPD M and B, alcoholic F rather than ""self-referencing"" through a thread here at OOTS. A light went off big time and I was so much more okay with not pushing myself to make deeper friendships IRL, but just get out there a little bit more at a time. And I am much more comfortable saying hello to neighbours, talking to my hair stylist, etc., things that would have just drained my energy a year ago.  What feels important about being able to venture out now is being able to be open here. I see that the sky does not fall, there is compassion and support, and that I am not alone.  I couldn't find that IRL because like you and so many here, I would constantly be triggered, a facial expression even would ignite doubt, shame, in an instant.  Here I can say what I need to in my own time, I can practice being my authentic self.   And the sky does not fall - huzzah! Just yesterday after writing the post above I had a friend of 20 years over and we had our first open discussion about our pasts.  I knew intuitively that she had faced trauma, but she was guarded and I was guarded and we never brought any of that up.  But we did yesterday because she is in recovery as am I and the time was just right I guess.  I didn't have an EF, but I did sleep for 12 hours last night lol.  Anyway, my point is that I think you're right about ""the rest will follow""  "
1038,"How do you turn it off? How do you stop the flood of negativity, the drumbeat of other people's perceptions that drown out your own? I've always done this, and I understand why. From my earliest moments, I was indoctrinated with the belief that what others thought of me mattered more than what I did. That what my family said was more true than what they actually did. Add a naturally sensitive, empathetic nature, sprinkle in the ability for keen observation and self-imposed vigilance, and you have the ingredients for a life of seeing patterns and assuming intent, a life of discounting your own best interests (of barely being able to discern them), a life of anxiety and despair. A life of believing other people held the key to me.I used to think of my capacity to read and understand others as an enormous gift, one of the best things about me, a kind of rare depth perception most people lacked. And in some ways I still value it, because it fed my creativity and humanity. But it's become overwhelming, and no mantra of selfhood turns down the volume. I notice too much, read into what I notice too much. It's gotten easier to just withdraw, isolate. I think the instant default to shame is one of CPTSD's cruelest, most intractable legacies. Does anyone know what I mean? "
1039,"Coda wrote: ""I used to think of my capacity to read and understand others as an enormous gift, one of the best things about me, a kind of rare depth perception...""For years I too felt that way, then discovered it was really my hyper-vigilance playing out. I got far away from the FOO's territory, created what I thought was a fiercely independent life, but still absorbing too much from others. I was kind of okay, but something inside kept gnawing.Years into this process of unraveling the damage, I finally sought out a T. I wasn't upfront with what I really felt, though, other than a vague and steady anxiety that wouldn't shake loose. The T looked at my questionnaire, asked me more about it, and zoned in on childhood abuse I'd absent-mindedly checked off on the form. I became very alarmed as she probed me further on it, stammering words like ""been there, done that; I've read lots,   "". For once, I'd met someone who saw clear into my avoidance of self. By the time that session ended, I was a mess as I realized all that I'd been trying to hide from. Part of the worst self-realization was knowing how much was not just escape, but absorption of the abusers message that I really was no good, a failure, a sinner, etc. Then followed anger/blame/self-blame/depression cycle, and still alive.For a while I'd been a wilderness canoe guide; this journey through the rapids of my self is by far the roughest trip I could have ever imagined. And I'm still trying to sort out a good route; I want to find a clear chute, but if I hesitate (i.e. not find ""me""), I'll be swept into more danger yet. You also noted:""I notice too much, read into what I notice too much. It's gotten easier to just withdraw, isolate. I think the instant default to shame is one of CPTSD's cruelest, most intractable legacies.""That summarizes my life, too. Hyper-vigilance to the max; exhausting, too. I still feel judged, knowing that I better please ""them"" or it won't be good for me. Even living alone, I feel watched (huge inner critic). Shame is a long river. We'll make it, though; reach in our pocket and find the key that was always there. Thank you for this, coda.    "
1040,"Thank you woodsgnome, for this incredibly generous, perceptive reply. Being heard is a good thing. Being truly understood is beyond measure.Do you think it's solely hyper-vigilance? Might there be an iteration that takes those qualities and marries them to something more than mere service and servitude? It gets so hard to tease apart what's valuable from what's unhealthy. And when I can no longer be that person I feel I ought to be, and want to be, I just freeze, retreat, protect myself from the world and the world from me. And then, the poison cherry on top of the poison cake of self recrimination: coward.I often wonder what it would be like to live without self-consciousness, to stop looking in the fun house mirrors where every bad thing appears bigger than it is. But neither do I want the kind of oblivious, uncharitable permafrost that so many 'well adjusted' people inhabit. For survivors like us, there has to be another way, to turn what nearly destroyed us into something that will save us. Lately though, I'll be dammed if I know what."
1041,"Coda, what you say is very familiar ground. I wonder if a link to what's beyond hyper-vigilance could be mindfulness? Perhaps it helps to restructure hyper-vigilance and view it from its positive aspects. In Walker's book, for instance, he points out that people with hyper-vigilant tendencies can easier access mindfulness. There's a mini-industry of programs teaching mindfulness and we've created a shortcut with our onboard hyper-vigilance.The kicker, though, remains the self-consciousness. That daily self-critique, the notion that I better be careful around others, they can't be trusted. It's such a given, and such a drag. Last night I had a phone conversation which I analyzed for hours after. Did I say this right? What did they think of that? What was meant when we discussed our day? Etc., ad infinitum, ad whew! You wrote this:""I just freeze, retreat, protect myself from the world and the world from me. And then, the poison cherry on top of the poison cake of self recrimination: coward.""I agree with everything but the coward part. I know I've felt that way, but wouldn't characterize it any further than calling it fear now. Coward implies there's something wrong with me, and I've worked hard to try and clear those implanted messages that I'm sinful, a coward, a roustabout, no good just like ""they"" always told me. It especially didn't fit right with what I ""depressed"" myself into a couple years ago. That's when some very horrid dreams were coupled with the sudden deaths of 4 close friends--and friends I can trust is extremely hard to come by. It was a ""just give-up"" time for me. I wondered if I hadn't reached a nadir point; I wasn't sure about living, and if I wanted to pick up the pieces of a broken life. Not the first time that feeling hit hard, but surely the most intense (nah, it wasn't half as bad as when I considered ending it in high schol). But I found another way to think about things. I started with a T again and, on my own, looked into what true self-acceptance was all about.I'd been reading about self-acceptance before and I wondered what else could I really do anymore. Slowly I started accepting myself in a better frame, starting with the hyper-vigilance. The trick is getting past the constant skepticism of not trusting my own instincts that this was making sense. That's disappointing, sensing a new way but the old pattern resists loosening its grip on one's psyche/soul. One step forward, two back, but I'll take the one step any way I can. I think the acceptance may be a part of that route through the rapids I talked about in the previous post.Another twist  involved pulling back on lofty expectations. I was continuously looking ahead, or of course behind as I'm still in run away mode. I missed what was right here, now. Now has become a buzzword in psychobabble these days but whatever the label I'd never really done that before, as I was in the run/coward state. In a way it's like retreating behind the retreat but stripping the guilt away from doing so. Past/future are still out there, but at least the hyper-vigilant/mindfulness thing has a chance. Being hyper-vigilant, I've tried and struck out trying to incorporate guided approaches. I end up judging the voice or the image of the person doing the meditation. But I rediscovered that this doesn't happen with well-written guided meditations. The best in that regard is Stephen Levine's Guided Meditations, Explorations, and Healings. It's full of short, well-crafted, good flow meditations. Of course, some probably record them in their own voice, but have you ever met my inner critic? So I just read 'em, and they're beautiful.Another key, for me, is patience. But what is time, when you live in the now space...I hope that makes sense?.Not sure I've explained this very well. And it went long, revealing my insecurity about fully explaining what I mean.The flip to my hyper-vigilance is that no one ever understood me before, why would they now. i better leave it at that, and thanks again for sharing your own take on the difficulty of getting any sort of re-bearing as we saunter further along the trail.   "
1042,"Hi Woodsgnome  I was reading this thread today to seek others advice and experience with this topic.  Thank you for sharing your experience below:QuoteI'd been reading about self-acceptance before and I wondered what else could I really do anymore.

I think the acceptance may be a part of that route through the rapids I talked about in the previous post.This is so validating for me, that my experience at the moment does signify that I am making progress.  I am hyper-vigilant, do not trust my instincts, and the old pattern of thinking is not letting go.  It feels like a fight in my head and it is exhausting.  But I am sensing a new way, I am just hoping it starts to take over the old at some point.  And, like your perspective on the steps forwards and backwards.  I do the same, one step forward, but I catastrophize when I go backwards.  It feels like more than 2, like 5 or 10, so I beat myself up because I think I am not getting anywhere.  My T told me last visit that I was getting better and that others could see the change even if I could not.  But I know that in order for me to make real progress, learning self-acceptance is essential or I really will get nowhere.  Any progress I make will be shaky and eventually I will relapse.  My T also practices mindfulness, I will ask him if the link beyond hypervigilance could be mindfulness.  Also, if it is something that I could start working on know or if I should wait until I have worked through this current stage.I am glad you are here Woodsgnome, you are a wealth of information and insight.  You bring a fresh perspective to so many at OOTS!MaryAnn "
1043,"MaryAnn,I've been practicing -- or maybe trying to practice -- mindfulness/meditation, at the suggestion of my T.  Like all practices, it doesn't solve anything directly.  The goal is to focus on the present, which can cut through some of the catastrophizing that many of us are prone to.My T has recommended self-compassion meditation for mindfulness.  Two places to look on line are websites by Christopher Germer:http://www.mindfulselfcompassion.org/and Kristin Neff:http://self-compassion.org/I've attended a few group sessions in the past six months (I live in an urban area with resources), but I've found lots of guided meditations on line.  "
1044,"Awesome  !  Thank you for the info.  I will definitely check these sites out.  I have only really become aware of mindfulness through group therapy and we did one exercise.  I definitely could see the value in it, but many others in the group did not share that same opinion.  They were more resistant to it.   But after dealing with severe anxiety and panic attacks for over a year, I am open to trying just about anything that will give me some relief and help me manage it  .I will look for guided meditations online as well so that I can expand on the basics that I learned in group recently as well ask talking to my T about teaching me mindfulness meditations as well.Thank you, thank you, thank you....MaryAnn  "
1045,"MaryAnn, just beware that people experience meditation differently.  Some are apparently ambushed by the quiet, which can allow demons to be heard.  Marathon meditation is usually not a good idea, I'm told."
1046,"In the book section I reviewed a fellow named Jeff Foster and I love his approach in the self-acceptance realm. Below is a link to a video that shows the tone of his approach. He has tons more on YouTube that are worthwhile, including some on mindfulness and a couple of short guided meditations; anyway, here's his ""deep acceptance"" intro:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oftVkm_UNkkHis self-acceptance book is ""THE DEEPEST ACCEPTANCE...RADICAL AWAKENING IN ORDINARY LIFE"". It brought me out of a deep funk I was in 2 years ago; it isn't jargon-filled or technique-laden, which I found refreshing. His best book, in my opinion is FALLING IN LOVE WITH WHERE YOU ARE, and while the title makes it sound almost giddy and pollyannish, it's short, sharp, clear language goes deep into issues like grief, pain, relationships, etc. in an extremely readable format. It's not how-to, or ""this-is-how-I-did-it-and-I'm-wonderful-so-listen-up"", but just a light but still serious take on seeing life in a different vein. It's not cptsd-specific but it touches on all the bases of this journey. As one reviewer put it: ""his thinking is way out of the box, honest, and an amazing amalgam of the simple and complex"". Worth a look for an original fresh take on this journey through the cptsd labyrinth. I've also appreciated the Kristen Neff materials that stillhere mentioned. As she points out, self-compassion seems to have better effects than the popular emphasis on self-esteem.  "
1047,"Thanks for the heads up stillhere.  I could see my hypervigilant tendencies taking over and doing something just like marathon meditation but it makes sense that it is probably not a good idea.  Appreciate the warning as well.  I will take it slow and work with the T to help me with it.  Hi Woodsgnome,I checked out the link you gave.  Jeff Foster seems more down to earth.  I will be looking up more from him on youtube.  Thank you for telling us about his books.  I will be ordering them from Amazon as well as one from Kristen Neff.  Thank you both for the recommendations and support!MaryAnn "
1048,"I've lived all of my adult life with the fear that something horrible is going to happen to me.  This fear has destroyed romantic relationships and friendships throughout my life.  From what I have read on this site and the book I am reading, I understand that when I am experiencing this fear I am living in the past.  My Baptist minister father told me once that god was going to kill someone in our church in the month of October of that year because they turned to sin and away from him. He would not tell me who it was.  I was terrified because I believed it was me.  Similar scenarios played out over my childhood with my father singling me out as the child who he told his dark prophecies to. He would put me in the car and drive and would tell me how god was angry and how he was going to destroy the world during our lifetime.  I believed my father completely.This coming Monday I am meeting for the first time with a psychiatrist who specializes in cognitive therapy.  My current psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bi-Polar disorder ten years ago but I never believed I was or am.I知 a 50 year old man and I知 sitting here at work shaking like a child.  My boss and co-workers are not aware of it because I知 hiding it.  I知 tired of hiding it.  I want it to go away.  "
1049,"i am so sorry you feel like this today, glbreed. i have lived with deep fear all my life and i know how debilitating it can be. and how hard it is to feel safe. good grief, it sounds like your dad gave you lots of things to be afraid of.  that is an appalling thing to do to a kid! no wonder you are still feeling so afraid. who wouldn't? i wish i could tell you i have it all fixed, but i don't so i can't send you much in the way of inspiration for dealing with it, except trying to be as kind to yourself about it as you can. all i can really say is i get it, and i support you. sending you a big   "
1050,"glbreed,I totally feel this. I lived in a safe zone for a long time, and i do not like the feeling that life is passing me by. That's for sure.I am taking this Improvisation Class, and its SO TERRIFYING! But I am learning in the class, that like, in the class (but also relative to life) you always mess up and do something stupid and silly, and sometimes feel stupid, or have to play it off like you're totally cool, even though you are mortified of what just happened.I'm learning to be terrified, and just do it anyways, because it feels better in the end. And I can't tell you how much joy it's brought to my life. Pete Walker talks about that ""feel the fear and do it anyway"" mentality. it's hard when there is something inside of you that is making you feel so afraid, maybe thoughts? Inner critic telling you you can't do it?Sometimes I just listen to my thoughts, and I'm like, ""no you're wrong. I can do that."" Because my head constantly is like ""Don't say that, don't post that, no one cares  blah blah blah""...So I just have to tell my head to shut up so I can move forward.That's just what has worked for me. Its easier said than done, but you are not aloneAnd welcome "
1051,"There's an old acronym that often comes to mind when I see or hear about fear (my own included). Take the letters spelling the word  fear and think of them this way:F---fantasyE---expressedA---asR---realityHaving a fantasy is just a storyline that can be rewritten. It has no real bearing on the final  outcome. There's room to play with options, and as one moves forward the fictional fantasy that was so frightening just fades away. The only prob is what often gets said here--that's easier said than done. Fantasy is pretty alluring. How the fear was planted, in your case, was and is painful, but you needn't focus there anymore. You've turned the corner, and while the father and his angry deity might show up in the rear-view mirror, they're no longer in the car with you; now you're the only driver, headed towards your heart's desires.  Sure it's scary, but you've made a good start by what you've shown via your sharing here and arranging to see the psychiatrist next week.  Congratulations on finding the new road; enjoy the trip, and remember, your friends on this forum support you all the way."
1052,"p.s. glbreed, have you ever read The Body Keeps The Score  by Bessel van der Kolk?  it really helped me with this particular difficulty. helped me see that it wasn't that i was foolishly living in the past    but that, becos of what was done to me, my brain and my physiology was changed to being on constant alert.  and that a) it has never been my fault and b) i could do stuff to change it, and literally fix the bits in my head that got screwed (that highly technical interpretation is the best i can do. he explains it very much more intelligently!!)   "
1053,"Perhaps for those of us who had to focus on survival -- to survive, that is -- fear can become an over-riding emotion?  At least that's what I've been thinking lately.  Yes, it may well be neurologically wired after so much repetition.  The question is how to rewire the system.My understanding is that van der Kolk pretty much disparages cognitive therapy for CPTSD (or whatever it might be called).  The idea is that symptoms, like fear, are generated below the level of conscious thought.  So I'll be interested in what this new psychiatrist has to say.Meanwhile, glbreed, I hope you find some peace, least away from the intense fear for a while."
1054,"Hi,I have been struggling lately with whether or not I want to keep my Facebook account activated.  I have a hard time with decision making in general, but this has gone a bit far.I'll keep it there (deactivated) in case I feel secure enough in the future to use it (like to share art and stuff), but I find myself ""checking in"" or activating it more often on it. I comment on things, usually its funny, but I immediately take it down, like I do here...I don't NEED it. I think maybe I am just impulsive, and maybe just wanting to feel connected, but it seems to be a distraction.I have like 50 family members blocked whom I used to have contact with, but for my own safety, I have had to block all these people, so they don't figure out my location (my father installed quite a bit of fear in me). I think for me, Facebook possibly sends me into EF's of when my family was there, and I find myself checking in on my sister and such, which makes me sad, because I miss her. My T says that it doesn't seem good for me right now, and my boyfriend suggests I continue to keep it deactivated, so I can check in when I feel like it...But that is not working. Maybe I should just permanently delete it. I'm tired of stressing over it.Has anyone had trouble with this? What are your thoughts?"
1055,"You BLOCK 50 people on Facebook? No wonder the site is a major trigger trigger.I don't even KNOW 50 people. But maybe that's my flaw.  I know nothing of Facebook, never appealed to me. LinkedIn is already too much social media for me. All these updates and tweaks all the time Boring. But then, that's strictly a business necessity.But then I'm also of the (apparently) rare breed who leaves his mobile phone at home when I go out with a friend or go to a diner where I'm invited.I actually read an interesting article a few weeks ago on how all these social media stuff (Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, the lot) are pretty smartly designed to trigger the 'addiction' mechanism in the brain.Bottom line was that somehow it's the 'want' that is in the end the most satisfying, the biggest 'kick' you actually get just BEFORE you log in.Facebook is obviously a pretty lousy drug.   "
1056,"I am tremendously heart broken.  I went through all of the family members that i had been hiding from who were blocked on my facebook, because I knew i was going to get rid of my account, and I wanted to like, in essence, say goodbye to some loved cousins and aunts and uncles.I so badly wanted to message some of them. Some of the family members I had were close to me for long periods of time. My niece, my sisters, my aunties. And some of my cousins.Trigger Warning...Facebook isn't what is hard for me. Life is what is hard for me. I miss my family so much. I miss having something comfortable and familiar. But the truth is, that when i spoke out about what my parents had done to me, no one believed me, or validated me, or respected me. And I don't need that. The fact that my mother and father both molested me really messed up my life. I was taken advantage of so much after I left home. So part of this list of ""blocked"" people, are guys, that I considered friends, who took advantage of me (but I couldn't see it at the time), women (one in particular) who kept me inebriated so she could take my things and walk all over me. Living in my home.I thought these people were my friends. I thought these people were my family.Facebook is just another reminder of this pain. I don't need anymore reminders. I'm sick of having an avenue where I could so easily talk to people who I love, that I will never have.I am devastated. I am so grateful to feel my feelings, and to have gained clarity on why I needed to disconnect myself from that world, and why I need to continue stepping into the one that I am in now.It just hurts so much. I've lost everyone."
1057,"I am also struggling with the deactivation of my Facebook account.  I loved Facebook.  I connected with people from my past who I loved and met new people whos interest I shared.  And then my relationship of fifteen years ended over the holidays last year and Facebook became a field of emotional land minds.  I had to unfriend almost all of our mutual friends, telling them before I did it, because seeing or hearing anything about my ex caused me extreme stress and depression.Over the July 4th holiday I saw a photo of my ex with his new boyfriend, someone that I had suspected he was having an affair with while we were together.  It hurt me very much.  It was then that I decided to deactivate my account for fear of seeing him or hearing about him.Now I am without the connection to people I enjoyed. All of the old familiar feelings came flooding back, the isolation, the loneliness, feeling like everyone else is better than me, feeling like no one wanted me, that I was unloveable, feeling I was useless and wrong, feeling I wasnt good enough to be a part of a group, feeling like no one can be trusted, feeling like everyone wants to hurt me, feeling like everyone hates me, feeling ashamed of being me.I miss Facebook, but I am scared to go back.  It was a positive thing in my life and now I associate it with pain.  I have no hope at this point."
1058,"hi glbreed, i am so sorry you are feeling so sad. i don't have any answers, i feel so much the same way but i just wanted to send you a big hug  to let u know i am thinking of you:bighug:   "
1059,"glbreed Facebook can certainly make breakups harder. I just got rid of mine from all the triggers it was causing from the past. I went back and forth. Made different accounts for years but have now concluded it is not a good time for me to have one. Why would I want the reminder of such painful events? but I am grateful to have clarity on this now. I don't need the extra triggers. I already have enoughI'm sorry for your pain and loss. I can't tell you what's best for you, but I can say that for the people you have lost, other ones will come along and guide you, or replace what you had before. I'm watching this slowly happen in my life. Take care and be gentle with yourself. Thinking of you   glad you're here."

People who are truly worth knowing are there for you no matter what. "
1061,"Kayfly and glbreed I feel your pain. I hope that you can find a way to see the changes in your lives and the pain as being a positive thing, that it's part of CV the journey to recovering lost parts of ourselves. Losing a partner is never a nice experience, but if it's any consolation, due to dynamics in relationships its hard to make progress while in a relationship, unless your partner is much healthier than we are. It's unlikely that that would be the case as we tend to attract and be attracted to people of similar levels of mental health. Being on your own is the best way to move forward, despite the lonliness and loss of intimacy. Glbreed i hear your inner critic loud and . I hope that you can stop it telling you that your ex might have betrayed you, while you have no evidence that it was so and don't let that critical part of you go and find the evidence and use it as an opportunity to put you down and send you down deeper. With social media theses days, it can be a bit like a highly concentrated version of reality and it seems that some folks seen to want to give up their privacy. I have found that my friends are posting a lot less personal stuff than they did a few years back so it seems that face book is maturing a bit. I found initially when I re-connected with old friends I found a lot of old bad memories and feelings coming back, but I have found it really liberating to find that a lot of those feelings and thoughts now have no substance and can be left behind in my teenage years. We are all different and have different needs, there are lots of ways to still keep folks as contacts but not see anything they post, unless you want to actually visit their page. I can see though that people who have deliberately caused us pain or exploited us aren't great candidates to be following on social media.I thoroughly recommend reading Helen Fisher ""why we love"" which is an excellent book, puts romantic love into the context of neuro chemistry which helped me a lot to understand why I was in so much pain when I broke up. I found that when i realised i was simply doing cold turkey from dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin it was a lot easier to handle my heartbreak. Now I also see my inner critic was an integral player in my pain, knowing what I know now I could have gone through that experience just feeling a little sorry it didn't work, maybe a little betrayed but at the same time realising that I was now free to do whatever I wanted.I now believe that St. Valentines day, romantic dinners for two and internet dating sites should come with a government health warning. Romantic love should be seen for what it is: a cruel myth perpetrated by our society to encourage us to spend money and create pseudo emotional dependency that is simply based on overproduction of neurochemicals, that's not love in any shape or form."
1062,"Hi there!I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced the same thing as me. My eldest daughter who chose to live with me following my truly harrowing divorce from her father has recently left home. She has just turned 21 and was ready to go out into the big wide world. Her and a friend have found a lovely new flat and moved in about 3 weeks ago.My question is this. Has anyone else been through this and had their abandonment issues triggered? I have been having severe flashbacks since she first told me she was leaving home. I managed to keep it together enough to help her move into her new home. But there were days when I would curl up on her old bed and sob and sob despairingly. After my divorce from her father I relocated to a different county to escape him. She followed me a few months later as he became abusive to her. I had re- married and the three of us became a new family in a safe and loving home. This formed tremendously powerful bond of shared experience and when she left I felt bereft. My intellect told me that she wasn't leaving me, just leaving home. But sometimes I was overcome with such a deep grief that it shocked and scared me.There is probably a link between this and me searching for a new outlet. That's when I came here.Kubali"
1063,"Dear KubaliI know that feeling very well that when a person to whom I was able to bond leaves or just goes on vacation the adult part in me knows that they are not  gone but the inner child which gets triggered does not know that  and reasoning helps nothing. I unfortunately have no trick I could share to help you feel better.. When I can I also curl up on my bed and hope it is soon over. Maybe the things you can do when you have an Emotional Flashback can help.I know that the memories of what happen in my first 2 years of age when I was in the orphanage are locked in that little child and when it gets triggered the child takes possession of me.It happens to me with my Therapist, what helps is that I write her an email it gives me the feeling I am in contact with her an she is not gone. Maybe you can write an sms or call you Daughter it might help to feel less abandoned.I send you a big  ET"
1064,To ETThank you for your lovely reply. I was touched by it.I'm so sorry to hear that you suffer Flashbacks to your time in the orphanage. They are certainly gruelling aren't they? Like you my IC always despairs when someone I love leaves. My youngest daughter chose to stay with her father when I relocated 5 years after my divorce. To say that I was heartbroken is an understatement!! I desperately wanted her to come with me. I knew she would be safer. But she was old enough to choose for herself. I found out that her father had told her that if she moved she would be 'dead' to him. I think she chose to stay because she was afraid. She also knew that I would never force her and that I would love her whatever she did. The same could not be said of her father.The pain was unbearable. I don't really remember much now about that time. My eldest daughter came to live with me and her dad was hateful towards her. She went through a terrible time as he turned his whole family against her. She was 14.Now she is 21. I think I'm probably being triggered back to those earlier times when my ex poisoned the children against me. I have lots of old wounds to grieve.I do hope you find some comfort here on this site. Sending you a hug!!
1065,"I have posted an ad seeking a roomate to share my 2-bedroom house. I'm really scared, but I'm trying to move forward with this because the fear over my finances, losing my house and feeling even more trapped in my crappy minimum-wage job is getting stronger. And I'm also doing it because a little part of me hopes for companionship, and a way out of isolation and the shame of not having the life I ""should.""Can anyone suggest questions to ask applicants to weed out anyone with narcissistic or bullying tendencies?I've already thought of using the word ""peaceful"" in the ad, and asking a couple friends to help me with a second opinion of the applicants (although asking for that help is also scary).Thanks.smg"
1066,"SMG - There are actually a lot of other problems you can have with roommates that can trigger you , besides, narcissism and bullying.  My room mate is an alcoholic and when she goes into her own little world it is very triggering as she is loud, obnoxious, talks on and on, tells the same stories over and over and is unaware of personal space, crosses boundaries left and right. So long story short  she was asked to move out in the kindest way possible but I was very firm.  And this was a friend.  I did not know her problems were this bad before we moved in together.So having said that and having been through it myself, here are some other things I think could help.  You could ask for references, and follow up on those. and you could ask for family contacts as well. You could also make the lease very short, like 3 months or 6 months, so that if there is a problem you can gracefully part ways. I did not see the full extent of my roommate's problems until about 3 months in.  At first she was on good behavior. So keep the lease short. Another thing that might help is a job.  My roommate does not work and neither do I so we were in each other's hair all of the time.  If a person is on a different shift, that could work out great. Less time together awake. Anyway I would not advise taking anyone who does not work.  You need to be very firm about house rules up front in advance, like drugs, loud music, loud talking, etc. We had problems with that for sure!Anyway I hope that helps a little. I would not wish what I went through on anyone.  Though I have to say that after I got my courage up to lovingly confront her?  She escalated and was angry for about 2 more weeks, but then calmed down and has totally turned her focus onto her own life and getting her own place, and I am so happy for her.  And she tries very hard not to trigger me anymore."
1067,"Thank you, Foggy! Yes, substance abuse would be a big problem for me. I will ask for references and about employment.smgp.s. I'm glad to hear that your living situation got better."
1068,"Hi SMGI think the best way to evaluate anyone is to listen to the structure of the language both body and verbal. I try to tune out what is being said and watch for what is not being said. Does that make sense?Good question to ask is "" can you remember the last time you failed at something?"" This kind of question if adroitly dropped into the conversation can open the person up. If they do the ""yeah but it wasn't my fault"" then show them the door politely. If they do the "" yeah I really learned something"" you are on safer ground.Do they mirror you at all? Are they listening? Do they speak well of others or are they withering and negative? Your instincts will guide you. Always ask for a follow up visit. For clarification purposes. Are they accommodating and punctual?Hope this helpsKubali"
1069,"Kubali,Yes, that helps! That question about failure is brilliant. I think I need a test that has really clear criteria, because I'm still learning to notice my instincts yelling warnings at me. When I met with one woman who was interested in the room, I tried asking her something like ""what happens when you're upset and you forget all your conflict resolution and effective communication skills?"" I think at that point she listed all the support groups etc that she could turn to, and then she turned it around and asked me if I had enough support and resources. I think I was very triggered during the whole process of meeting her, and I determined to push through and agree to have her as a roommate -- fortunately, she decided to live elsewhere. I'm a little troubled that I didn't notice all the signs that she and I would have been an extremely bad fit. It's really not surprising that I still need more practice at honouring my feelings.I'm still looking (very slowly) for a roommate, and the woman who inquired most recently seems very promising. She's out of town, so we've been communicating by email so far, and I've already noticed that we're mirroring one another nicely."
1070,"Church postings are a good way to reach out to good people who know good people!  Also, be careful not to put too much weight on one person.  Remember that you can establish your boundaries and work alongside someone.  Maybe there will be so much good to come from a roommate companionship!! But it's possible that you guys could make better roommates than friends; if you're able to stay open-minded, I think the possibility of disappointment will fall far less heavily."
1071,"Hi Im completely new here and wondered if i could share a problem im having to see if it is something any of you are also experiencing. I cant seem to understand it or help it. The issue is that i fall to pieces when with caring motherly women. Feeling SAFE and cared for makes me dissolve. Its terrible. Today i was attending a class at our recovery college on journaling. It is a lovely safe feeling environment and the teacher is so caring. I couldn't control my need. My child. I felt myself go small and panicked. I got tearful and detached. I excused myself form the class and the teacher came out to see if i was ok. I was shaking and crying and clinging on to her for dear life. HELP. HOLD ME. DONT EVER LEAVE ME. I hardly know this woman but her safe motherlyness brought out this MASSIVE uncontrollable feeling desperation. Its like an urge - like needing the loo or needing food. It is primal and i dont know how to control it. I am fine with strangers but with people i find safe i turn to jelly. These women all react calmly and seem untrubbled by me - they sit with me, hug me, tell me to breathe and that im safe. I think my behaviour is actually very tame compared with the wild feelings of NEED. It is causing me such distress though. My child jumps to the front and is desperate for comfort and my critic is screaming abuse for being week and needy and pathetic. Any thoughts? All the stuff ive read so far seems to assume C-PTSD = inhibited/closed off reaction. I am the opposite completely. I cant stop talking about things and feeling and this child need for a 'mummy' is so powerful it makes me feel ill. I cant function when i always become an emotional wreck around people who are caring/safe/motherly.  "
1072,"Hi Tink - I am wondering if you are seeing a therapist? I ask because it may take some guidance as to how to calm your IC and ICr and not dissolve when you are around safe, supportive motherly women. E.g., Perhaps these women can serve as role models you can use to reparent yourself and when you're able to do that the need will decrease.   "
1073,"Hi Kizzie,Thank you for your response. I am not currently in therapy but have had several years of it at different times of crisis in the past. There doesn't seem to be much talking therapy on offer these days on the NHS, i am on a LONG waiting list to see someone from the trauma team. I can't afford to go private. I do have the issue that this mother need means that i attach to therapists STRONGLY straight away and it makes life fairly torturous every second im not in that one hour a week with them. I often wonder whether the distress of attaching so strongly and then inevitably loosing each professional outways any good done in the years of therapy! God its all so hard! I am asking for help and accepting everything i get offered - so far drugs and recovery college courses. At the moment it is this urgent need for protection that is flying out at safe women that is my main problem. I'd love to know if anyone else here has experience of this. It is the need of a tiny baby for protection against death. Primal."
1074,"Hi,I do hope that this message isn't too triggering, and that the info i suggest to look up doesnt send you into a huge spin. Maybe that would be helpful to you right now, to delve in, but i urge caution. I think seeing a therapist is a great idea. You are not alone. I know exactly where you are coming from. It has happened and is happening to me. Lots of times.I understand the pain and the desperation. Like you, i never knew what it was.You can not help it, and it is not your fault. Your feelings must be here for a reason.It sounds like your inner child is screaming out for motherly love. It needs the grief of ...whatever happened or did not happen with your own mother to be grieved, angered, it needs all those feelings to be released out of you.It might be helpful, if you would like, to look up mothers who emotionally neglect their children...as emotional neglect is invisible. Emotional abandonment too.  Look up mothers who ..abandon...and mothers who on the opposite side, abandon their children by smothering them.if something has been missing, the mind tries to find subtitles for its pain.Perhaps you felt panicked because you thought you wouldnt be able to have the connection you crave, from your teacher?I describe this as like looking at her through a glass wall.That was what it was like and is like with my own mother, only now i am finally aware of where it comes from. That came from a lot of reading.It sounds to me like a flashback. One thing that made me think this is that, your reaction is not a normal one for the situation as it was just class. And you mentioned you felt really small and was shaking.Of course, with your past, the FEELINGS makes complete sense FOR YOU. (not intellectually) But not for outsiders unless it is explained.It sucks that your inner critic is going wild, screaming abusive things.It doesnt matter that you express this in the opposite way to being closed off, inhabited. Talking is one way people try to deal. Perhaps you are looking to be heard, seen, for the validation that your perhaps never received in childhood?There are ways, which i do find difficult, of talking back to that inner critic.  How can you do that with the very mind that is ...broken?With in time, if you are able to understand where this is coming from, and understand your own situation, perhaps you will feel slightly more empowered to start comforting that child inside you and talking back to your inner critic.I do hope this has been some help.  I have no idea what to do about it...not sure if your looking for answers as yet, just the need to know your not alone, and to perhaps figure out what is happening?Take care  "
1075,"Quote from: tink1382 on May 09, 2015, 06:57:42 PMi attach to therapists STRONGLY straight away and it makes life fairly torturous every second im not in that one hour a week with them. Again, I want to echo everyone's sentiments that you are not alone. I feel exactly the same about my therapist at the minute, hate leaving her office and knowing I have many days before the next session. It's like my therapist has become my world and I try to ignore all these feelings I have, except when I'm with her. Not good! When I see her after a week I'm the same as you, I have a primal reaction.  I think the only way forward is to explore these feelings, as you are, and talk about them with people who understand and can help you through them. "
1076,"Wow! I can relate to this, but with me, I get that initial small child response, followed by a reaction of fear and anger. It's like being around someone who cares and is the least bit mothering sends me off the deep end."
1077,"Wow thank you all so much for your replies! I really do feel alone in this and its amazing to read that others have similar experiences! Indigochild what you wrote was wonderful thank you! The psychiatrist i am seeing at the moment is wondering where to place me next. He is considering the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. I have no idea if that diagnosis fits. I have problems with it. He says that it is basically the same as C-PTSD and seeing as the latter doesn't exist as a diagnosis then treatment for borderline is the next best thing. I feel extremely confused and in a spin. From what i read about borderline, manipulation is a major component and it horrifies me to think that i may be able to control this need more yet dont so that i receive care from others. I really need to find some way to comfort this DESPERATE child myself. The whole experience of being comforted is terrifying and extremely stressful for me even though i feel unable to stop the urgent need to try and get it. I think a lot of the terror is - what will this do to the other person, is this ok, what will it do to the relationship, how will this make me suffer later, WHAT AM I DOING!!! etc etc. FloatBoat your reaction sounds similar to what i mean in that the need RACES forward like a sudden desperate need for air and then massive parts of me fights it and lashes at it ferociously. Do any of you know of any useful tips for controlling/stopping up this need when it is triggered? At the moment i feel unable to be around women because of the feroceous mummy need and unable to be around men because i feel vulnerable and easily stressed by them. Really really hard.SO grateful for all your thoughts and kind words!!!! "
1078,"Hey....I am so glad you find it helpful hearing others experiences.I was surprised myself to come back to this thread and see that many others feel the same!And no problem...(i cant believe you think it was wonderful haha!)  I have had a similar experience to you as well. at age 19, say psychiatrist as the doctor put me on meds...he said BPD traits but that i was too young to diagnose. Have you watched this guy? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0k5DvjiRNUHe is called Spartanlifecoach, and i love all his videos. He is not the most sympathetic to people with personality disorders, but i think his aim is just to empathise with people seeking help from dealing with persons in their life with disorders that negativley effected them.This video explains how Cptsd and borderline peronslaity disorder are similar- and the reason why they are similar, is because apparently ALL PERSONALITY DISORDERS and depression, bipolar etc. are a result of trauma. Trauma causes PTSD or Cptsd.Narcasism personality disorder, borderline, whatever it may be, are the normal, natural ways you tried to cope as a human, BECAUSE of the trauma that was happening to you, and the after effects of the trauma on you.Even though a persons mind is *disordered* after trauma, and therefore their actions are distorted, i hate the word *disorder*, as it sounds like you are not a human being, with a very normal response to trauma.Anyone, Jo blogs down the street, would have tried to cope in a similar way to yourself, if he was in your household or wherever the trauma / traumas happened.Oh yes, and also, not everyone fits the entire nine criteria listed for borderline personality disorder. Some do, some don't, but we are not robots, therefore not everyone will fit the *textbook* down to a T.Some people have mixtures of personality disorders.They call this being *co morbid* so for example,you could have Borderline, and be com orbit what Narcissistic persoality disorder.From both parents, you usually pick up both traits, therefore resulting usually, in a disorder, com orbit with another, of you have *traits* of your disorders.I hope this makes sense, and sorry if you know this already.This guy also explains CPtsd. With manipulation, a person with BPD can be manipulative with out meaning to. It horrified me also and i didnt think i fitted that category.There intense emotions, fears, whatever the symptoms....can effect people they are living with.Manipulation can happen because for example, they are afraid a person will leave them. Some people may threaten to hurt themselves if that person leaves..or if they go away for the weekend....and that threat, even though out of sheer fear and desperation, can unintentionally manipulate the other person to comply to the person with BPD.Once i was so angry at my boyfriend for smoking canabis, that i  ended up saying some pretty hurtful things under my breath whilst we were at a friends house, where he was smoking it.I felt, that he didnt care about how that would make me feel (sounds quite narcissistic that!), as i had expressed before how it hurts me to see him do it. I felt that he didnt care about my feelings, and that he ENJOYED hurting me.He said i was quite nasty, and i can imagine i was, as i am like my mum as a result of her upbringing. He said he has never seen me be so manipulative.Being manipulative along with BPD, doesnt mean you have the tools or ability to control your disorder. It doesnt mean that you can control weather or not you are manipulative.Thats the thing, many people with BPD are shocked that they are *maipulative*, they just don't see it, because they feel so utterly powerless most of the time and in pain!Its all done uncntously. Now, some people are more aware that they are doing whatever it is, but they can not stop because of how they feel.  They could be being really mean, but are so upset they carry on, or they are so mad they carry on.  Or they feel so wronged by the other person, they know that smashing up their car is wrong, but they do it anyway.Aware or not, that person would be in pain and the pain is the driving motivator for their actions.It sounds like your inner child from long ago, just thinking that if you could control  your needs, you would get more care from others.Perhaps your parents didnt like that you had needs as a child and teenager, so you thought- if i wasnt crying / needing this, that...then they'd love me.See, the reason you may be BPD etc. is because all your life, you did things for others, you hid your emotions etc. and things bubble up and come out.  Maybe so far, being *good* and not manipulative, has not gotten you very far. You may think it has in society / with friends...but you are probably sick of being *good*.What you are describing sounds like the push pull - its quite normal for a lot of us who have had trauma.Yes yes yes!! Pushing people away once you have got what you wanted, you push away the thing you need the most.People can be afraid of being hurt by the other person, afraid of them leaving, you could feel suffocated, could worry that on the opposite end of the spectrum if you want to call it that, that you will be smothered by the other person.Im sorry but i don't know how to stop this need once triggered.I think your mind / inner child is trying to get what it needs, and it can only get what it needs when you are able to provide that for yourself. When you are able to mother yourself.This is a process, and not to put you off, but as you know, its hard and scary, and the inner critic likes to get in the way and sabotage that a lot.Im so sorry you are struggling.  Are you seeing a therapist or have you considered it?oh also, I'm sending you this by Katie Morton:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8TCDlGjK-MShe answered these questions:1. ok, so your vlog explained WHY we get attached to female teachers but i want to know HOW do we detach? how do we stop idolizing, wanting attention and generally STOP this attachment that we have with people?2. related to the previous questionLesbian or wanting a mummy figure? Ok so because i look up and get attached to attractive females in my life am i gay? having BPD makes me struggle to answer my own question about sexual identity, one day Im like yup defo gaymy god shes hot..yay! next Im like  hmmm, i dont no, maybe i just want them to be my mummy? pleeeeeease help?3. Whenever I first see a therapist/ school councilor/ social worker I feel really freed by telling them everything and I am pretty open BUT then after about a month or so of seeing them I always stop trusting them and so this means I never continue seeing them. Have you ever experienced this as a therapist? And do you have any advice for me as I'm meeting a new therapist (Through CAMHS in the UK) in tomorrow and I really want to escape how I'm feeling although I'm scared to let go of my self harm as I have relied on it so long. Sorry that was really long, I love your videos so much thanksI myself found her answer disheartening and i know ill be so mad at my parents if i have this incessant need for the rest of my life, even though it might not have been their fault i received that kind of parenting.Let me know what you think...."
1079,Wow that was a lot! I will think about what you wrote. I hadn't heard of Kati Morton before but have just checked out her youtube videos and she is fab! I will definitely be watching some more of her stuff!Thanks 
1080,"Yeah Tink- im so sorry for the HUGE message!!I didnt think that i should not have provided *advice* or any ...resources?...maybe i misjudged that.I hope it doesnt overwhelm you.If you do have any questions, feel free to ask. I wont reply with such a ramble next time!"
1081,"So, I did a SCID-II screening, and I have no PD. Period.I did score a few points at various PD indicators, but well below the threshold for a PD.I'd like to talk about one of them, and if it has any relation to CPTSD.In de BPD section I scored on ""temporary, anxiety tied, paranoid ideas or severe dissociative experiences"" (probably a lousy translation, but hey, I think you get the picture.)The example (as mentioned in the report on my SCID-II):My mom and sis (both uHPD) are in the 'therapy' business. Apparently this is not uncommon: the urge for self-help manifest itself in helping others. They have a great need in helping me. All sorts of things are wrong with me, at my core. But I digress.So at a point in me coming out of the FOG, I had this notion that I was in a very uneven battle. They are therapists, and thus know every trick in the book. Good or bad. Yes, bad.At some point I got this mental image of always fighting with them, defending myself ""No! I'm not wrong, there is nothing wrong with me, let me BE!!!!!"", to no avail. I felt like boxing with professional heavyweights (or any weight for that matter) while I was just an amateur. Off course I always lost! (my Sis actually trains girls self-defense against (sexual) assault)Fast forward to a meeting with a dear friend, whom I know since I was 15. One of the guys with whom I entered puberty, adolescence and what have you not after that (I'm about 50).He said at some point: ""You know, Hysperger, you are in a boxing match with two professionals, and you simply cannot win.""   I was baffled. I didn't trust my own senses. I didn't trust him. Did HE just say that? Or was he simply copying what I had said earlier to him? (I don't recall telling ANYONE ever about me being the sparring partner being knocked into the hospital by the great Champ(s)) Was he just pleasing me? Was he just saying this to be finally of the hook by all my whining about Mom and Sis?It was a horrible feeling, because I'm SO convinced that none of this is the case. (rationalizing afterwards: if any of this was true, why would he even still invite me over for diner with his wife, and cook the most gorgeous food? (He's a sort of Gordon Ramsey, including the foul language if he deems it appropriate. He spares no-one, when applicable. I love the guy).But the paranoia was still there, and hard to kill.Scenes like this are rare, but I have the feeling they should not be there AT ALL. Not on this level of mistrust at least.Thoughts?NB: I want to pursue some more of these SCID-II points. They are not PD's, but they are certainly a pain in the butt. I would like to have a bit more grip on these levers."
1082,Does your friend know your M and S?  Have you considered asking him directly about why he said what he did about them?  This could help to undo/reduce some of the paranoia that you learned in your FOO.  
1083,"Thanks for the ideas.I was too baffled at the time to react properly   . My head spinned   .(for completeness sake. He has met my mom, but ours was not a house where friends hang out (same for Sis' and Bro's friends) He has never met my sis. I was quite shocked by that revelation actually)."
1084,I have been in a committed relationship for 20 years with my spouse and occasionally I hear about their want for me to 'open my heart'. This confuses me as I do tell her everything. Thoughts feelings ideas etc.Then last week I got an email from a good friend I've known for 10 years telling me she would like me to share more. I am flattered and touched that she cared enough to write this. She has been through a lot over the years and I have always been there for her.Now I work hard to keep my life on a steady keel without a lot of drama. My T says I do this on purpose due to my past. I don't gossip or have any big emotions to share. So basically I want to know: what do these people want from me?? I feel I am missing the intimacy boat here somewhere.I think I share almost everything with my partner and I'm not interested in dragging my friends into my childhood traumas or therapy. I know I am guarded but I'm at a loss here. Perhaps I'm overanalyzing. My friend may be concerned with oversharing.  
1085,"Quote from: wingnut on April 15, 2015, 07:23:22 AMI think I share almost everything with my partner and I'm not interested in dragging my friends into my childhood traumas or therapy. I know I am guarded but I'm at a loss here.   My two cents: Share whatever you feel comfortable with. I've shared my childhood traumas with my T and my h and on OOTF/OOTS (even my kids know only rudimentary facts - I don't feel it fair on them to burden them with my problems; they know only in very general terms why I and therefore they are NC with my Narents). I've had female friends who coaxed me into sharing more than I felt comfortable with at the beginning of my recovery, when  felt very raw and uncertain of myself and looked for validation, and in both cases I've regretted giving into their coaxing (both turned out to be Ns). So please don't feel obligated to share what you're not comfortable with, even if that friend shares more than you do in return: Everyone has a different comfort zone and you have every right to stay within yours.Another thought that comes to my mind: There are different ways to build a strong and lasting relationship. Sharing thoughts and feelings is one way, but another one is sharing experiences, hobbies, excursions, sports - whatever. There are good and strong relationships between people who spend a lot of quality time together but hardly ever discuss feelings. So if you have your partner/friend sharing in many of those, that's still 'sharing' and still works towards building a good relationship.Quote from: wingnut on April 15, 2015, 07:23:22 AMNow I work hard to keep my life on a steady keel without a lot of drama. My T says I do this on purpose due to my past. I don't gossip or have any big emotions to share. So basically I want to know: what do these people want from me?? I feel I am missing the intimacy boat here somewhere.I cannot possibly comment on whether you have intimacy issues or not but I definitely understand why you try keep your life on a steady keel and avoid drama whereever possible. Same here. I thrive on a steady routine and little to no drama. It's something I never had as a child and I feel I need and deserve it now. It's not only because of my past - it's because it's best for me in my present time."
1086,"Thank you - I really appreciate y'all backing me up.My T suggests that I retreat in situations like this and I'm sure that given my mountain of trust issues that others see me keeping them at a certain distance. I've had so many experiences in the past where offering up too many personal details was like giving people ammo,  on top of the usual defenses from growing up in the land of dysfunction. My T also suggested that I share the inner child concept with my friend as a starter conversation to sharing more. My friend is in therapy too for work related stress and perfectionism issues so I don't think she would judge. I just don’t know that I want to go there. Back to the trust issues and revealing the protected core. Do I really need to share my history of abuse to get to the next level of closeness?I like what you say about boundaries but do think I am too detached at times.I do get jazzed and excited and share joys, frustrations but prefer keeping MY sharing on the surface with the majority of folks. This makes me an excellent listener and confidant. And as you said, I'm a really fun activity partner. My partner is codependent while I'm a freeze so I wonder if she is simply seeking the same level of neediness from me. We make an interesting study on attachment disorders. ;-)"
1087,"Thanks!It's been a long road.  Relationship speed bumps are my remaining issues, I think, but they encompass a lot of CRAP."
1088,"Ok, so I’ve been contemplating these ideas a lot the last few days.  On one hand it makes perfect sense.  On the other there’s something that’s still bugging me about it.  But I think that I’ve figured out what that is.  I used to “fawn” a lot.  I would seek out situations, people, friends and family who behaved inappropriately.  I would “win” them over.  Then I learned that those people never really changed and although they were sometimes “nice” to me they also criticized and/or ignored me.  It was always about them.  So I quit them.  I didn’t need to work for a while either so I could really avoid them and the ensuing contact.  Then I went back to work.  My son periodically behaves like his NPD father.  Reality again.  I need to cope.During all of this I became aware of people who would frequently excuse poor behavior.  A classic example is driving.  Someone is aggressive, goes too fast, cuts another person off, flips the bird, etc.  But friends or family say, oh, it’s ok, they’re having a bad day.  And I’d say well I have bad days, but I don’t lash out at other people like that.  It’s not ok.  And I don’t really want to know or interact frequently w/a person who behaves in such a manner.  It’s toxic.  And even the healthiest of humans can only afford so much toxicity before becoming ill.But there’s still my teen son.  My ex.  My parents.Then I come across Byron Katie.  I briefly looked over her web site.  It makes sense.  I want to be enlightened like that, for toxicity to wash past me too.  It aligns more closely w/my belief system.  But I don’t want to excuse, enable, or be harmed either.Please, help me understand…does her philosophy mean saying “(bad behavior-yelling, insulting, hitting, criticizing) is ok b/c she/he (reason-bad day, someone died, sick friend, lost job, et.)”? I feel like I’m missing something here, or making something simple complex, or perhaps I’m just not yet ready, but it’s been nagging away at me and I would like to understand better."
1089,"Her work reminds me of the 4-step process I learned about in workshop. However, I think the 4-step is a stronger way of getting at a similar resolution. Copy & pasting the 4-step below. QuoteThis is a very intense exercise that allows you discover your authentic self and get to the root of feelings you are using as a mask - a mask you could be unaware of. One person is The Reporter, another person is The Witness. Here is a quick summary of the process:Part A: Uncensored expression. The intention of this process is to connect deeply to your emotions - you, being the reporter. It pulls you out of your head and into the emotions to contact the heart.Step 1: Attack and Blame. The reporter shares uncensored the current upset state, withheld thoughts,conflicts, etc. Each statement begins with ""I want you to hear that [insert attack thought here]."" [I am angry, I hate it when you X, I resent Y, etc.]The witness responds to each statement with ""I hear you."" (Note: if you are role-playing the witness, you are encouraged to think of a sheet of plexi-glass in between you and the reporter, as the emotions can run quite high).The reporter: ""I want you to hear that I am angry...that you were late again last night.""The witness: ""I hear you.""If you are fully expressing your attacking mind, you will also heal your guilt & shame-based mind. Attacks should be present (not past) and always directed at the person they pertain to. Avoid long pauses between statements, as could indicate censoring. This step goes for 5 minutes.Step 2: Contacting the vulnerable selfThe theory here is that anger is a defence and once we've exhausted the attack level, we'll drop into the vulnerable self. The reporter's job is to expose and give voice to the vulnerable self by allowing the root feelings to emerge. If anger comes up again, Step 1 is not completed. The witness receives the communication by saying ""I hear you"" and invites more communication by adding, ""Is there more?""When the vulnerable self is present, the reporter adds in ""just like when..."", using the root feeling as a window to trace back into the past the point at which the reporter can first remember feeling the same way. The step feels more like a confession vs. an explanation.The reporter: ""I want you to hear that underneath my attachk, I really feel lonely. Just like when my Dad left when I was 6""The witness: ""I hear you. Is there more?""The next step is redefining the source of the problem, having seen the vulnerability, from ""out there"" to ""in here.""Part B: Returning to LoveStep 3: Revealing the Suspicion of self/other/worldThe root feelings stem from issues, such as fear of not being good enough, worth enough, loveable, etc. These feelings have been amplified in Step 2 and now can be used as a conduit to the suspicion of self/other/world. The reporter simply keys into theh mistaken belief, as the witness continues to respond.The reporter: ""I want you to hear that I have been trying to prove my fear that I cannot trust...but I have been mistaken""The witness: ""I hear you. Is there more?""Note that these are uncovering beliefs, *not* referring to behaviours or situations. e.g. You could not say ""I want you to hear that I have been trying to prove my fear that that you will leave me, but I have been mistaken"". Beliefs are focused on because they determine our experience; we have limited control over events and less over others, but we have control over what we choose to believe.  Step 4: Correction through connectionThis is the most important step of the process, as the reporter connects with the witness to correct mistaken beliefs and return to love and truth. It is important that the reporter actually believes the correction, so a step is added where the witness asks the reporter if they accept the truth. If you don't accept it, then say so, specifically as ownership is a major component of the exercise. The correction ""remembering..."" should always be framed in positive language, never negative. e.g. instead of saying ""help me to remember I am not guilty"" say ""help me to remember that I am innocent.""Maintaining eye contact with the witness is critical, as the it helps us stay in the present.The reporter: ""Will you help me to transform the believe that I am not good enough, and remember the truth...that I am good enough, no matter what anyone else says.""The witness: ""I will help you to remember the truth that you are good enough, no matter what anyone else says or does. Do you accept that you are good enough?""The reporter: ""I accept (or don't) that I am good enough.""Note - even though the witness says that they will help you to remember, the ownership of remember is on you, not the reporterSimilar to Byron Katie's work, this helps define the issue, understand what it reflects inside yourself, and then return to love by correcting the misguided beliefs inside yourself. I feel this process is clearer and that you don't hit against that wall of feeling that you are responsible for the problem...but at the same time you take accountability for your own emotions. And taking accountability is incredibly empowering because it actually stops the absorption of other toxicity from others while allowing you to have compassion for them. It took me a long, long time to deeply understand this, but when it clicked it was powerful. "
1090,"Thank you BeHealthy and Sandals for your thoughtful and heartfelt responses.  It helped me to see this is not a simple topic and I'll be patient w/myself as I figure out the answers while I prioritize my own wellness.I also realized that I am a bit sensitive to any idea or concept that is too connected to a person, also that seems to be the end-all answer.  So I think that was my initial reason for pulling away a bit.  But thought is reality so if I simply say, it's not about a name and it isn't the end-all, then that allows me to explore these concepts as I'm ready.  So I think that I've already internalized one of the idea which I like which is to take any stressful thought and try it on in it's ""opposite"" form.  Like when I think ""my boss just wants the job done, he doesn't care about my health"" it stresses me and thought is reality and it's him so I don't really have a way to know for sure, so I'll just think ""my boss cares about our workplace and about the health of the employees, including myself.""  My stress stops and there's not ""proof"" for the negative thought, so I'll teach myself to use the other instead.I am quite encouraged to hear others explain how this type of process can increase their own serenity, happiness and enlightenment w/life, because that definitely is my goal.  So thanks again and cheers to us for learning in community   "
1091,"I have never posted here.  I normally post in OOTF on Unchosen and that has been some serious work    But it seems like now that I am OOTF I am having so many troubles in so many other parts of my life.  I feel today surrounded by Ns with nowhere to turn and everything, everything is just triggering, triggering and there is just no peace to be had.  So I went NC with an NPD Unchosen, but it seems that was only the tip of the iceberg.  It feels like many more Ns are lurking, eager to take the place of the Unchosen NPD that I am NC with.This is going to sound silly to so many of you, but I dont know where else to post.  I went to get my hair done a couple of days ago.  My hairdresser is definitely codependent, but is finally getting a divorce. She rents space in her salon to others who have a clientele.  She calls this new coworker woman in, and says something very dramatic to her to set her off.  In hindsight, its almost like shes showcasing this woman, wants me and my sister (we get our hair done together every 6 weeks) to see how crazy this woman is.  The woman does not disappoint.  She comes into the space and starts ranting and raving about how great she is for taking care of a nephews friend and what she did for him, and how awful the kids parents are, and how ignored she felt by the kids grandparents and how everyone took advantage of her by not keeping her in the loop and not telling her that they were buying him a bus pass, and how she was so upset because she did not know if theyd given him money for food, or she was going to have to make him lunch, and how wonderful she was to take him to the bus and put him on it.  On, and on, and on.  This woman was standing, I was sitting and she kept looking at me trying to make eye contact with me the whole time she was talking and I refused to do so. I just would not look at her.  I guess I was hoping that if she saw a total stranger ignore her, then she would get the point her story was not welcome and I did not want to hear it.  But it did not work.  But it REALLY upset me and triggered me badly. It was my Ndad all over again ranting and ranting and raving and looking for approval and appreciation and just sucking the air out of the room, just draining everyone emotionally.How am I supposed to handle that?  I seriously considered getting up and just walking out. Not saying a word, just walking out.  Later when I was in the chair and trapped getting color put on she came back in again and told another story of how great and awesome she was, and I was just sick. I did not know what to do or how to make it stop. I couldnt stand it, but I was trapped.  In the chair. So I sat quietly looking down and waiting for her to finish.  With my stomach churning.Then last night a showdown with my room mate. My room mate came into the smoking room and she asked if she could watch the game on TV, and I was reading but I said yes. And I was a bit nervous about it. But I said okay.  And it starts inevitably.  The cursing, the yelling at the TV.  I am reading, and with difficulty managing to concentrate but I am struggling.  I am losing my control.  I get up several times and go walk around inside the house, and do deep breathing like the book said to do. But I come back out to MY smoking room because I want to smoke and read my book and it is on my PC and my PC is hooked up in the smoking room. But, I feel violated, and stepped on and disregarded. Its a combination of the loudness and the language.  But I am okay to hang on, until she starts talking to me.  I am reading and processing possibly being sexually abused and digging deeply and painfully into my memories.  And then she says something and I ask Are you talking to me?  She says yes, I want you to look at this guy on the TV, look at him, the short one on the right.  I said B that guy has no meaning to me I am not listening and I am busy, I am reading a book.  She says insisting now, Just look at him, this is what my nephew J could be doing if he got into the right sports market. I blew. I said, You wanted to watch TV, and that was fine with me, but I wanted to read my book.  Asking me to look at this guy on TV is the same as if I insisted you come over here and start reading my book. Do you want to read my book?  She knew something was wrong at that point and apologized.  Then I said, I am happy to share the room with you, but I do not care to pay attention to the TV right now.  I dealing with some deep stuff and I am really going through some stuff right now.  She says, Well thats all you have to say, that you dont feel like talking.  Then she adds If you need somebody or some help let me know.And thats it.  Now I am furious, I am so angry because in some weird way I feel like she made me mad, and made me talk sharply to her, which is NOT true. And its on for me.  The night is ruined. She changes the channel, turns down the volume and settles down to a much lower volume of talking to herself. And I try to ask about American Idol to try a bit to make up. Then go to bed with some fiction to read, and end up getting up and taking melatonin, then taking Nyquil, and then smoking a cigarette on the deck outside alone, and then reading my book some more, to try to knock myself out. But I am roiling.And wake up this morning in a full blown CPTSD flashback, with inner critic chatter, incessant chatter in my head, and even before I get up I am yelling STOP in my mind to the chatter.So my point is, that I am getting these triggers all of the time from my roommate. She is so abrasive, and so loud, and so unhappy and so angry with the world. And she uses profanity a lot at max volume. She talks to herself non stop and it is difficult to tell when she is actually talking to me and not just herself. She is an alcoholic and occasionally abuses pills in combination with the alcohol, and can be so obnoxious that I end up confronting her the next day.  The talk always starts, What do you remember about last night. Answer, Nothing It is nerve wracking to live with her.  And even a loud mouth stranger just ratchets up my anxiety level to the point I want to run, just run.And I dont know what to do.  I feel like I am just ruined, not fit for human companionship anymore, because I find it hard to get along with these aggressive type people for more than an hour or so.  But, the fact is neither of these women abused me for years.  But their small boundary invasions feel like an army marched into my soul and started taking over and I dont know how to handle it.My reaction seems, feels inappropriate. And I feel like a bad person because there does not seem to be room for me and them in my life. I just cannot tolerate the behavior, and that feels like I am the wrong one, and the bad one.  And if I was a good enough person I could get along with them. But I just get angry instead and feel violated.And over the top anxious and self critical and I need some advice. Should I be able to get along with my room mate no matter what? How do I handle a stranger treating me like a public verbal vomit receptacle? A place where it is okay if she regurgitates? And same for the roommate really.  Sometimes it feels like she is just vomiting all over me and I cant take it and I feel like I should be able to take it. I feel like a normal person would be able to tolerate it.And I just vomited all over you.  Sorry, I guess stuff does roll downhill."
1092,"Hi VeryFoggy  I'm new here too, and incidently, ""very foggy"" as well! I do not think the way you feel makes you a bad person. And I don't think it would make you a good person if you could tolerate someone who you felt was violating your space, because that would mean abandoning how you feel. It sounds like your roommate is self medicating whatever pain she has in her own life, and unfortunately, that means that she's also possibly numb to the effect she has on others. It's healthy to feel angry if you feel like someone is violating your space. I know that if I had been in that position - and I often am in a similar position - I would be furious. If you feel that you acted too aggressively in response, then you could try to address that with your RM if it continues to bother you, or just try to change it up next time a similar situation happens. I realize that might be easier said than done - at least it would be for me. It sounds like she toned it down somewhat after you said something, so that's a good sign.But I don't think it makes you ruined that you have a hard time around people like that. Not at all. You ARE fit for human companionship!   And I did not feel vomited on, reading your post. Not in the slightest. I could have written it."
1093,"Same here. It was all so familiar. In fact, I'd take bets that this is how many of us would feel like.I second what mourningdove said. Finding your roommate grating on your nerves doesn't make you a bad person. I'm in my mid-fourties, I've been married for over a dozen years and I've got two kids who I love to bits, and sometimes they all just drive me up the wall. It's life. Even lovely people you're fond of can turn your hair prematurely grey sometimes. No one ever gets along with anyone no matter what.Also, do you think you could maybe be an introvert, and/or highly sensitive? Introverts need a quiet, peaceful, ""alone"" space where they can recharge their batteries. It sounds like you don't have that at all. My husband's an introvert (an ISTP), and when he has to constantly be around people - especially around drama-inducing loud unpredictable people - at the end of the day, his nerves are in shreds and he goes HISSSS at the slightest provocation. It's not because he's grumpy in general. He's just out of energy. He generally likes people. If he has enough peace-and-quiet alone time, he gets along well with most people, even difficult ones. If he hasn't, he doesn't.Also, he's grown up in close proximity to a narcissist, and he HAAATES word vomiters. The reason is, he never got to cut those word-vomits short, not even kindly. If that person was in a mood to hold court, everyone else had better dance attendance on her OR ELSE. Now, maybe I'm reading too much into this. But you seem to have a similar resentment against word-vomiters that he has - that same sense that they're pressuring him and insisting on talking, in spite of the fact that it's so very clear that it's not wanted. Like it's an act of force. A violation of clear boundaries. When the truth of the matter is, he's been stewing quietly in his own resentment without actually making it clear what he wants. Not that I'm blaming him. It's probably an echo of what life was like when he was a kid: there simply WAS NO WAY of telling that person what HE wanted. What he wanted didn't matter. If she wants something, by Jove she MUST get her way OR ELSE. No wonder he hasn't got much of a habit of interrupting word-vomiters. There's a third thing you seem to have in common (again, I might be reading too much into this, and I apologize in advance if I do): he tends to not take enough alone-time. It's like: if people want him to be around, if they want him to listen, he doesn't feel he has a choice. It's like he's got a constant sense of obligation and pressure, a constant sense of ""how could I even say no?"" He's getting better at it now, but it's a deep-seated thing with him.So that's why I'm wondering: your feelings about those two incidents - do you think they could emotional flashbacks? You seem to have some very intense feelings, and that sense of powerlessness, of being trapped and cornered, that sounds a bit flashbacky to me. In any case, I hope you're alright now, and that life is treating you kindly.  "
1094,"Oh man, we are such cosmic twins, amigo. I have act myself this exact same questions.He you are, healing, and you are realizing how much of your feeling and preferences has been stuffed down. Correct or no? I am breaking up with my boyfriend because he complains all the time, and I have validated and try to show compassion and set boundaries, but it never worked. Good man, but he irritate me to no end and triggers me. There are a LOT of wounded people. Many people are are not safe, even if it is unintentional. I can't be around people who have temper problems, or just poor decision strategies.Maybe you are just raising your standards? I have had to break off from really irritating, triggering relationships. I have a number of good relationships that are not triggering. This are higher quality relationships in general. "
1095,"Same here Very Foggy - I got to a a point where I could not take people like your roommate anymore -  for even an hour.  I once quit a job three days in because my new boss had me fish a banana peel out of the garbage and walked me and it to a can in the lunchroom because it would smell (never mind that the office trash was emptied nightly).  That was simply the last straw in my ""death by a thousand cuts"" life.  I was fast approaching a thousand cuts and had to choose between me and the dysfunctional and abusive folks out there.  I chose me.Maybe something similar is underway in you?  Part of recovery for many of us is distancing ourselves from PD/abusive behaviour so that we can focus on ourselves.  As you know only too well from OOTF, PD's don't allow that and we are trained to feel shame and fear when we don't meet their needs.  And even if people aren't PD, if their behaviour is PD-like it can have the same effect on us.I do hope your EF subsides and that you can accept that you truly deserve to create safe, quiet PD (or PD-like) free spaces for yourself.  "
1096,"Thank you all so much for understanding.  I really had it bad today.  It was like a full blown anxiety attack that lasted from 7 a.m. until about 3 p.m. It sucked. But I cleaned 17 seven ft. tall windows, did 30 push ups and then took my dogs ALONE for a two mile walk and felt MUCH better.I still have not explained or apologized for my behavior to my roommate.  I did tell her after cleaning the windows that I was having an anxiety attack, and that it was getting better, but that I felt more physical exertion was needed to work it off.  She offered me a Xanax.  Which I declined.This has not happened to me since May of last year. But I realized I have been doing a couple things that led to it.  I was stuffing.  My roommate moved in 9/6 last year. And she is a handful.  And of course! I thought I could help her!  Well slowly it seems she has been taking over my household and all of the sudden I wake up and realize * has been going on. I saw it, yes I saw it, but I did not do a lot. Gentle hints, careful reminders. Thinking she will get it.So tonight I do not feel bad in the least what I said to her last night.  She asked for it. She had been asked numerous times to please not yell and scream or play loud music. But she just does what she wants.  So that is not my fault. Not my stuff. So today I feel like she deserved snapping at. And what I said was not terrible. Because when I said what if I insisted you come read my book, would you want to?  She said no.  So I gave her a clear cut reasonable comparison to look at. Something that if she is rational she could say okay I get it.Mourningdove  Yes she is in terrible emotional pain but wont do anything about it except drink herself to death and pop pills.  I did think I could help her, but I cant, and I accept that. She drinks about a fifth a night.  Not kidding and combines it with Xanax and Valium on a regular basis.  It is appalling.Schrodingerscat _ Yes I am an ISTJ.  Whatever that means I forget. But I do like and have a LOT of time to myself.  I am retired, but living with someone I am not in love with is wearing me down. I love her and I care about her, but I am not willing to sacrifice me or my family for her. Which is what it feels like she wants.  Because shes always had that. Her family did do that for her.  But yes, that insistence on ignoring us and doing whatever the * she wants just because she wants to even though shes been told it is not acceptable is NOT okay. I think THAT is why I had the melt down.  She has been told it not okay to use loud voices in the sunroom, it is not okay to play music loud outside, every word travels, sound carries here, so keep it down. She was told and told again when she first moved in.  In my anxiety, I forgot that.  But I recalled it this evening.  And yes I was most definitely having a flashback.  I had been reading Pete Walkers CPTSD book and I was flashing big time.Marycontrary  Yes, I was stuffing for sure and forgetting what I had already asked her to do. I think I have a solution tonight.  She is not here forever just until she decides what to do.  But I am giving her an ultimatum of either abide by house rules or we cannot be roomies.  Its my house. Thats why I felt so bad!  Kicking this poor homeless woman out is just plain darn mean!  But she does have options and money and I was just a place that had space and we thought it would work.Kizzie  Yes it is disheartening to me to find so MANY PD like people in the world.  Its only 10% but my God!  Why does the whole 10% have to be in my world? My son in law, my son (who seems to be getting better with a mish mash of my attempts to use John Gray Men Are From Mars and OOTF techniques) and my NPDdad of course, and now this stranger at the hair salon and my roommate.  Its just exhausting! I really have only ONE friend who I think is totally not PD, and some days I have my doubts about him. But thank God he calls me every day.  Today he called me 3 times, and we talked and it helped. He just listens and validates me.  Which then makes me think I am PD but thats another story. Anyway here is my very long solution, but I have written my roomie a letter which I will give to her tomorrow when she is sober.Dear B,I am writing you a Feeling Letter.  I am very distressed about some things that have been going on with you, and with me, and with us lately, and this is John Grays format for dealing with such.  So I will be covering Anger, Sadness, Fear, What I Am Sorry About, What I Understand, What I Hope For and Want, and What I Appreciate About You. So without further ado:What I Am Angry AboutI am angry that you drink too much, and then get loud and obnoxious, and use obscenities at max decibel volume. I am angry that when you do that I feel invisible, and like I do not matter or count, that my feelings simply do not matter. I am angry that you dont seem to understand that it is not okay with me, despite me telling you over and over since you moved in that the neighbors can hear everything you say, and telling you that I have to live here, and get along with these people, indefinitely after you move out, and that loud noises are not okay, and you still do it.  It is distressing to me that you do not seem to care about me, my family, or my neighbors, and that loud talking and yelling obscenities in my sunroom or my backyard is simply not okay.  I have told you about sound repeatedly since you moved in, about keeping the sound down, and radio volume down, and how sound travels, and translation: so does screaming * at the top of your lungs.  I am angry that I have to spell it out for you. So, screaming and loud talking and yelling obscenities is NOT okay. I am angry that you get T-rashed on a regular basis, and so T-rashed that you do not seem to care who you hurt, or insult when you get that way. And, I am angry that despite all of our talks about not bossing little J around, you still get T-rashed, and you still do it.What I Am Sad AboutI am sad that I do not feel like you can hear me.  I am sad that despite my talks about loud sounds, and verbal clues, and hints like ignoring you, or not talking to you, you still act this way.  I am sad that it doesnt seem to matter what I say or do, you do it anyway.  I am sad that despite all of our talks about little J you still boss him around, like we never talked about it.  I am sad that you probably dont remember half of what I have said.  I am sad you drink and drug so much that you probably dont remember about half of your life. But I do, and it is not pretty, and it is very sad. I am sad that you will not get some professional help. I am sad that it appears you are * bent on killing my friend, and trying to kill our relationship while you are at it on your way down and out. I am sad that it is starting to hurt me a lot. So I am sad I cannot help you. I really wanted to, and not being able to makes me very sad.What I Am Afraid OfI am afraid to tell you these things, as I dont want to hurt you.  But I am more afraid of you hurting me, and hurting J, and hurting little J so I am going to say them. I am more afraid of you killing yourself if I dont say them.  I am afraid that it wont matter what I say, you are still not going to stop. I am afraid that I have already said so much, and it did not matter, so I am afraid it wont matter this time either. I am afraid you will not get some professional help, and I am afraid you are going to die way younger than you should have.What I Am Sorry ForI am sorry I cannot seem to communicate effectively to you how serious I am about these two things: noise and little J.  I am sorry I have to get in your face about it with this letter.  I am sorry all my talks about sound, and hints and clues did not work, or convey how serious I am about it.  I am sorry I cannot seem to help you or have any impact on you.  I am sorry you do not seem to be finding anything to hold on to.  I am sorry you do not seem interested in getting some help. I am sorry I feel so helpless to help you. I am sorry it does not seem like there is anything I can do to help. I am sorry I do not know what to do to help you.What I UnderstandI understand that you are going through *.  I understand that you feel like you have to drink and drug to drown your pain. But I also understand that living that way does not work for me. I do understand your pain, but I also understand if you will not help yourself there is nothing I can do. I understand that if you will not abide by the house rules then we cannot live together. I understand that it is hard to live in a house where you are not in charge. I understand it is hard to not know where or what you will do next.  I understand you need time to make a good decision.  I understand you would like T to be finished with school before you have to make that decision. I understand your life is in a state of flux and it is very stressful.  But I understand that it is not my job to fix it.  I understand all I can do is help and support you. But I also understand that I am not going to have another anxiety attack because of you disregarding the house rules. I understand that I am not going to disregard myself and my needs for a peaceful calm home, just so that you can drink and drug and be obnoxious. I understand that you will think I am judging you, but I am not, I am trying to care about all of us, and do what is best for all of us.  I understand you may think I am a party pooper, and just not very much fun. But I also understand that if you keep this up, you are not going to be around much longer to think any of those things about me.What I Hope For And What I WantI want you to respect the house rules and stop yelling and screaming and loud talking outside, and in the sunroom.  I want you to stop giving little J directives. I want you to come to big J or to me if you want to see a change in little Js behavior and let us take care of it.  I do want you take action if you see little Js safety is in danger, but that is all.  I want you to get help with your problems.  I want you to get counseling for your grief, and help with your addictions, or at least start trying to help yourself, do some self help.  I want you to be happy.  I want to be happy.  I want big J to be happy.  I want little J to be happy. I want us to work things out and I want you to be able to stay here as long as you need to. I hope we can work things out so that all of us can be happy. I want you to find purpose and meaning in your life.  I want you to feel needed and safe and happy. And I want the same for myself and my family. I want to work this out for everyone. Including you, but I am going to need your help.  I cannot do this on my own.What I Appreciate About YouThis list could get quite long.  I appreciate that you take care of your things and your bathroom and I do not have to worry about it.  I appreciate all of your wonderful cooking and things I have learned from you.  I appreciate your friendship and having a friend to talk to.  I appreciate the care you take with parking and always being concerned about little J and I being able to get him to school on time.  I appreciate you respecting my solar power program and taking the time to understand how it works and why I do the things around here the way I do.  I appreciate being similar in temperament about having a cold room to sleep in.  I appreciate your generous sharing nature, and how much you try to share with us  books, food, knowledge.  I appreciate you taking me in for Thanksgiving.  I appreciate all of the wonderful new experiences I have had with you  vacations and travel and new sights and new scenery. I appreciate how you clean up SO MUCH that is not your responsibility, and you do it with a light and happy heart. I appreciate how much of the time you do keep us, the family as a whole in mind, and try to do what is best for all of us. I appreciate how much you like to travel, and how it either gives us a break from each other, or something new to learn together.  I appreciate that you have your own interests and friends and I am not caretaking you.  I appreciate your independence, and your ability to take care of yourself much of the time. I appreciate you driving me around while I was blind, and taking me and little J where we needed to go.I do appreciate you very much B, and I hope so very much that we can make a couple of changes and things will be fine.  Fine for all of us. But, it is going to have to be fine for all of us, or it is not going to work. This is why the other night I would not give you a straight answer about you staying on here.  We have got to work this out first before I can make that agreement.  I cannot go on as we have been any longer. And if you simply cannot agree, then we will need to part, but it will be as loving friends who simply agree to disagree.Please think on this, and do know that I am well aware there may be things that you are unhappy about as well, and I am open to hearing your grievances too.  This is a two way street. There are a lot of wishes and hopes and dreams in this letter.  But two things are simply not negotiable.  The noise and the little J. The rest is up to you, your decision, and ultimately not my business. They are just my wishes for you, as your friend who cares about you.Love from your friendVery Foggy"
1097,"Wow, just wow Very Foggy    (I think you are going to have to choose a new name for the forum )"
1098,"Read over your posts; those of us with CPTSD have lots of triggers and different needs to keep ourselves at peace in order to stay sane.Due to my own issues generated from CPTSD, social contacts can be volatile.  First, I have to really assess if its 'my' problem with others (I'm bringing the static) or the other person/s are genuinely annoying, rude, etc.  Since I have an aversion to noises like babies crying, people griping about their lives, annoying habits...I have to take evasive, corrective measures to negate 'run-ins' with others.  If I get my hair cut, I find a salon where it's just me in the room; listening to everyday gossip nonsense would drive me crazy.  There's plenty of salons & spas that would work with you to have a peaceful experience.  For living space, I live by myself.  There's no way I'd tolerate the habits of another person; they'd have to put up with 'my' issues as well, which isn't fair to them.  I know I'd be difficult to live with, and the risk of taking my stress out on another person would occur.  As I'm struggling with the highs/lows of barely managing my own symptoms, I have to practice 'mindfulness' that I need to instill habits to keep social run-ins to a bare minimum, and that the possibility exists that I'm projecting my issues onto someone else and escalating things.  Case in point, I went to see a movie in a public theater a few days ago.  Two people sat behind me, chatting & eating popcorn so loud, it was driving me nuts.  So, were they behaving like everyone else in the theater? Yes. So, instead of turning around and ripping them a new one and escalating the situation into a confrontational scene, I saw some remote, quiet seats 7 rows down and moved.  They didn't get verbally ripped & I didn't get ejected from the theater. Some aspects of social interactions are very easy for most people to handle.  Those of us with CPSTD have a wide variety of difficulties with the human race.  Many of my military combat friends greatly suffer the same; so I'm trying to start a veteran only fishing network where I live...so we can go find quiet, peaceful areas to decompress & begin small steps to practice rebuilding a normal life.  When I see what they endure every day...scanning rooftops, streets, alleys, crowds for terrorists...in addition to social difficulties, I realize that my own challenges aren't nearly as bad as theirs. Which doesn't make mine any less difficult, but gives me a larger perspective that I am fortunate to not have war-time images permanently stuck in my head.  My New Years Eve was spent keeping a fellow vet from running off into the woods after hearing fireworks at midnight, which he took for artillery being lobbed.Best prevention I can do is find ways to keep me mellow most of the time is venturing out into the woods, mountains, trails, etc.  "
1099,"As if the world needs to help me understand all of this, it really is foggy outside my front door today!Your experience sounds so similar to so many realities here, including my own.  When people encroach on boundaries the normal response is anger.  Many of us who spent our lives being abused were ""taught"" to feel bad or guilty for setting boundaries, so we didn't and we survived, sometimes barely, thinking that was life and normal.  And on top of it all feeling obligated to ""help"" those who ""vomited verbally"" by listening to them.  My understanding from Pete Walker's book on CPTSD where he calls this ""fawning.""  It's a skill we needed to be ""safe"" in an unhealthy environment.  Both of my parents seem to think I'm I sounding board for their woes and even paranoid delusions (my dad ""hates"" people from different political or religious perspectives and will talk about how they should die or be ""bombed"", my mom complains about my dad...).  So we  the environment b/c we thought it was normal and ok.  ""Fawning"" was right.  Then the awareness comes and with it what seemed ok before now isn't. These people's verbal unhappiness could be appropriate with a therapist, an interested friend or family?, a forum?, but they clearly do not read or care about how people around them feel.  Body language and words say a lot.  They chose to ignore the feelings of those around them and unload neither truly relieving themselves and clearly harming those around them.I have a hairdresser who I quit seeing b/c of exactly what you described.  I felt unhappy, angry, irritated and couldn't even really name why.  It sounds like you've done a lot of work to make yourself aware of ""why.""  Personally I simply quit the hair dresser since I have control over that relationship.  When I had an aggressive roommate I found that I needed to go to coffee shops, the park, my car, my bedroom, etc. to read, journal or do meaningful internal work.  Fortunately I was able to change my roommate situation and that helped a great deal.Something that I was surprised to learn was that my adult daughter who I wanted around me didn't visit b/c she noticed the tension/aggression of my roommate and didn't want to be around it.  After moving she and I have grown closer and spent more time together!;)And finally, thank you for posting your challenge here.  It is normal and ok to feel anger.  This is such a healthy forum and ""place"" for you to process your challenge.  I don't feel ""put upon"" by your struggles.  In contrast, I think I and many others feel validated.  It's healthy for us and you as we learn together how to function in this world with the awareness, the triggers, and the tools necessary for the meaningful lives you and I deserve.I look forward to future posts and threads of conversation here with you and other forum members.  Thank you."
1100,"Thank you all so much for your posts and encouragement.  It means a lot to know other people have felt this way.  I was able to ""get on top of"" my anxiety yesterday and write the letter.  But I woke up in the exact same anxious condition today, and so I have not yet been able to actually give it to her. The anxiety was simply crushing my chest like a fist around my heart squeezing, and I was so scared I knew I could not have the adult conversation I needed to even to just give her the letter.  I did more push ups, took another walk and it's greatly subsided.  I feel like a grown up now instead of a petrified child who is scared to death. I hope this goes away soon because it is a very unpleasant sensation physically, and I do feel childlike terror emotionally. I haven't said much at all to her today due to this anxiety.Maybe tomorrow.  I just want to wake up normal and calm. In my adult mind and emotions."
1101,"OK...this is what I want you to put on you tablet or phone and take to be with you.Listen to Dharma talks by Ajahn Brahm until you go to sleep.Waking up with panic, put on another till you go to sleep....do this over and over...I am not religious, but I best I have listened to 8,000 dharma talks, and they help divert attention greatly. And it is FREE.It works."
1102,"Marycontrary - I downloaded an App from the app store, but there were no meditations?  If you would give me some more information I am interested.  Thank you very much!I (Finally!) gave my roommate the letter.  It took great courage, though I did not tell her that.  Just me, I told me that I was very brave to try to take care of me and my family.  I knew it was going to hurt no matter how gently said. And it did.  And she agreed to do the two specific things I asked for, which was no screaming outdoors or in the sunroom, and no more directives to the grandson.  Though she gave many logical arguments why she still needed to give him directives, and I finally conceded as long as she wasn't drinking she could give him some guidance.As for her grievances, they were many. Which is why I had to get my adult self back before we talked. I knew there would be blowback.  And for most of them, I simply said there was not anything I was willing or able to do anything about. She complained how dirty the house is. Which is true.  It is picked up to a fault, (I'm a bit OCD about clutter) and all laundry, dishes and counters, sinks and toilets are clean and clear. But there are dusty floors, and tables. She wanted to hire a cleaning service. No!  I want no obligations that she pays for! I did agree to set up a schedule for myself to clean more often. But she wanted chandeliers 20 feet off the floor cleaned, (they are not dirty) I dust them once a year, ceiling fans, light fixtures, ditto. I declined, said I would handle it.  Then she wanted the windows washed inside and out. I can't fathom why, but assume it is so I am obligated in some way so I declined again. They are fine, I am happy. I do regularly often (at least once a month) clean 20 windows myself, but she's talking about the 2nd story bedrooms, where blinds are closed most of the time.  No, doesn't need it until the house is up for sale which it is not.Then it got weird.  Such as disliking my son sleeping on the couch every night.  He has reasons and they are mental, which I tried to explain, but then she simply wanted me to fix him and I declined.  He is 30.  If he wants to fix his problems then he will have to do it on his own.  But it may be irreparable damage.  He's overdosed 3 times.And she disliked that my son and grandson do not do much around the house. Not her stuff.And she disliked how I talk to my son sometimes and that she was embarrassed for him.  Not her stuff.She said I was very negative and it was really bothering her.  You don't know me from Adam, so you have no way of knowing, but I am a very positive person.  I am happy most of the time, smiling, and kind, and a big believer in the power of positive thinking.  I pick my battles carefully. I am posting to get better not to get worse.  In any case that threw me. As my BF has often commented that my roommate is one of the most negative people he has ever met. I did not agree with her, I just said ""Wow, that's interesting."" But she is one of the most negative people I have ever met in my life, and it is draining emotionally to listen to woe is me, and I am f***** and the world is against me. Why do they accuse you of what they are doing?  Do they know?Then she said I am superior acting, that I act as if I am superior to others ""all the time"".  And cited my forums, and reading a lot of John Gray material, then quoting the material as evidence of how I was acting superior. And she said that that it felt cult-like to her. Again my boyfriend talked me off that ledge.  He said an alcoholic does not want to hear about how well AA is working out for you.  Same with your forums and your books.  You are improving your life and yours is getting better and she does not want to hear it.Oh, and the best part was that she said she thought I needed to deal with my Disorder.  That part I was actually able to laugh out loud at. I said, ""I do not have a Disorder.  I have been traumatized by a Disordered person, but I do not have a Disorder. Sorry none of the criteria fits me.""So all I can figure is that it hurt to be reprimanded, and it was just lashing out grasping at straws, or she really is the NPD, I believe her to be.In any case, it was a tough afternoon. I think I can expect better behavior for a short time, but ultimately I am not seeing a good ending to this story. I am not paranoid, and it really felt like she was seeking to regain some sort of control this afternoon, and that she was very frustrated when all she got was an agreement to clean the floors more often..."
1103,"Wow.  Congratulations on your follow through and posting here and processing with your BF.  Your roommate sounds toxic.  I wonder if she ""projects"" her own flaws and issues on to you.  Like the people who say I look tired, when really they're tired and is I ask they say ""yes.""  But she's not that self-aware.  Lots and lots of kudos for your efforts and steps.   "
1104,"I would get rid of her...she appears to have no empathy. This will end up in bad, bad news....methinks. Dharma Talks...here a good one to start.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RrCjzi74BA "
1105,"Marycontrary - I am interested why you say she has no empathy? I read through her responses again and could not see it, but I am usually quite blind to those closest to me. I appreciate the link.  I have started listening and right away I can see he is QUITE calming and soothing to listen to.  Thank you!C.  - Thanks for the support!  it means a lot!  I did wake up his morning with an epiphany of what she meant by being negative and acting superior.  I think it is because our interests are so different and I often decline her invitations.  She is rabidly into professional sports, and takes it so seriously. She often invites me to bars or Super Bowl parties and usually I decline.  I just have no interest.  I like books, and music, and learning, and self help and spreadsheets.  Give me a spreadsheet to wrestle with any day of the week and I am in heaven.  I was an analyst before I retired. And I am introverted while she is wildly extroverted.So I think that me saying no to her invitations makes me look negative to her, because I don't want to do the things she wants to do.  Then she probably takes it a step further, and believes I am a stuck up goody two shoes. So she simply cannot fathom that I just don't share her interests. So instead of appreciating my diversity, she perceives it as an attack on her choices, her decisions.  This is just a guess but I decided to ultimately not approach her about it because I do not feel it would be productive. I felt it would be best to see if she says ""I hope I did not hurt your feelings.""  At that point I could say, ""No it didn't because I don't feel that way about myself, but I can see why you may think that.""  And then explain about the different interests and see she agrees.And sadly after all of that drama of the letter, even though she was not drinking before I went to bed, she was incoherent and had probably taken some pills.  And when I got up this morning there was a significant amount of alcohol consumed after I went to bed.  It's just incredible to me that someone would drink when they already can't talk.  It is very sad and it is hard to look at. Painful even."
1106,"So my husband told my cousin who lives in our town that my family don't comtact or visit me so I'm not speaking to them either now. He told his parents who are visiting from overseas. It is SO lovely having his parents around. They absolutely love our children and are having a good holiday visiting us sometimes. His mother told me she doesn't know how my father can stand not having seen me for 8 years or the two youngest children. It is so lovely having a validating family member around. However she is going to NZ and said she is going to tell my mother I'm not being treated right. I see this as potentially an explosive situation and want to tell my aunt not to say anything to my mother as it will only push my family further away from me and give me an even worse label. Today I made an appointment with my therapist to talk about it and my husband went mad at me for talking to my therapist about such pointless nonsense. He said all I need to do is tell my aunt not to tell my mother, simple. So I felt stupid about myself and cancelled the appointment. He changed his mind and said I can talk to her now but I already cancelled it but am thinking of making another appointment in a couple of days. It's not just that I want to ask her about that she makes me calmer and my mind feels scrambled again and I want to ask her about some anger management techniques. So my question would anyone else see this as a pointless reason to talk to your T? As I feel stupid making an appointment now. "
1107,I think you can talk to your t about whatever you want without your husband's approval.We all know how talking about one thing can sometimes unsurface other things or the crux of it.please do not accept that the need to talk is stupid. Ever. Do what you need to take care of yourself. 
1108,"Same here. I can't really see how anyone without CPTSD can tell what is or isn't important to us. You've lived with your mother and with your CPTSD for long decades. If your gut feeling tells you that something has the potential to blow up in your face, or if you even just get this ""uh-oh"" feeling, then there's probably a good reason for it. I mean, people get that sixth sense after a while, don't they? Like, when you have kids, sooner or later you just look up from your work and know something's off and you should go find them and see if they're alright. Or if you write, you re-read your text and you just know something's off, so you search and re-read and search, and then a-hah, you accidentally changed your protagonist's first name. So if your gut feeling tells you that your aunt is about to prod a wasps' nest, there's probably a good reason for it. You're the expert. You're the one with the practical experience. Quote from: wingnutWe all know how talking about one thing can sometimes unsurface other things or the crux of it.I once spent an afternoon simply journaling about one itty-bitty silly problem: Sunday afternoons depress me, particularly when there's classical music on the radio. I dug a little, and that's how I learned more about Childhood Emotional Neglect. The Sunday heebie-jeebies were just the tiny tip of a massive iceberg. I very wisely didn't walk around telling people that ""oh, I must work through my traumatic past... and I'm starting with the fact that I hate Schubert sonatas"", because there is a limit to how silly I'm willing to sound. But like I said, it was just the crossroads where the skeleton was buried. Dig a little, and all kinds of traumatic things come up.Also, talking about what we ought to find easy to do... isn't that a moot point? You'd never visit someone in hospital and look at their broken leg and go: ""You know, you ought to be able to walk"". "
1109,"Whilst agreeing with wingnut that the need to talk is never stupid, and with cat thst no-one without CPTSD can truly understand the dynamics we feel in these situations, I would like to offer a perspective of my own. If your aunt is determined to tackle your parent(s) over their behaviour it might be a far more constructive experience if she asks why they behave the way they do towards you rather than condemning them for it straight from the off. Which will probably lead to instant defensiveness, communication breakdown and more undeserved blame. It's a small change in your aunts approach but it could make a big difference.

Hug back ( I always think Bheart stands for beautiful heart. Quote from: schrödinger's cat on January 04, 2015, 03:17:59 PMSame here. I can't really see how anyone without CPTSD can tell what is or isn't important to us. You've lived with your mother and with your CPTSD for long decades. If your gut feeling tells you that something has the potential to blow up in your face, or if you even just get this ""uh-oh"" feeling, then there's probably a good reason for it. I mean, people get that sixth sense after a while, don't they? Like, when you have kids, sooner or later you just look up from your work and know something's off and you should go find them and see if they're alright. Or if you write, you re-read your text and you just know something's off, so you search and re-read and search, and then a-hah, you accidentally changed your protagonist's first name. So if your gut feeling tells you that your aunt is about to prod a wasps' nest, there's probably a good reason for it. You're the expert. You're the one with the practical experience. Thank you SC, I do tend to overthink things when I have no adults around but when I have friends around I can cope with a lot more. However when it comes to my mother it's more than a sixth sense. From years of experiencei know she can't handle even one person disagreeing even on a very small topic. She can't even agree to disagree. Quote from: flookadelic on January 05, 2015, 03:49:51 PMWhilst agreeing with wingnut that the need to talk is never stupid, and with cat thst no-one without CPTSD can truly understand the dynamics we feel in these situations, I would like to offer a perspective of my own. If your aunt is determined to tackle your parent(s) over their behaviour it might be a far more constructive experience if she asks why they behave the way they do towards you rather than condemning them for it straight from the off. Which will probably lead to instant defensiveness, communication breakdown and more undeserved blame. It's a small change in your aunts approach but it could make a big difference. I'm so glad you have this space at any rate. We really do care so much. Thanks Flookadelic, I'm thinking about this and might actually end up doing this. Who am I to try and control this situation?Quote from: Rain on January 07, 2015, 11:55:51 AMI am late on reply to this post, AnneGirl.    Sending a      I've nothing to add, as I agree with others.   Just wanting you to know I'm thinking of you and care what you are going through.    You are wise, a survivor, someone I admire.   Hang in there, AnneGirl.Rain, thank you for your encouragement. I really needed your words today. Thanks so much. "
1112,"AnneGirl, I hope you have been able to reach the safe island of your therapist.   It is more than your Aunt's desire to help, or how she does it.   You are changing a lot, seeing the ugliness, and yes ...anger is coming up in you for good reason.   How to heal is as important as seeing why you need to heal which is the breaking of denial you've been doing recently.Well meaning relatives, spouse, etc. do not know, do not understand truly where you are.   Rely on your therapist to help you.   You have every right to seek help.Like Cat says, you can only have the vaguest sense that something is off, and behind that sense is a massive uncovering of the Truth.And, please drop the self-abusing language of words like ""stupid"" directed towards yourself.    I have done it, we all have done that ...to self-abuse is to continue the abuse of our family of origin (FOO) towards us.    It was NOT right that they abused us, and certainly not right that we abuse ourselves as they trained us to do.I know you are good, AnneGirl.   You are wise.  You are a survivor.   You are working through emotions that are coming up.   Be kind and gentle with yourself as you would anyone coming out of a war zone. "
1113,"I think there is a difference between trying to control a situation and influencing it as best one can. I think that ""control"" is a deeply held concept in CPTSD as we are dealing with controlling behaviour of our abusers and also I'm struggling with the idea that I don't need to be in control to be safe. Because I can't control everything. So I'm learning that influencing stuff is more practical because it's not an all or nothing condition, like control is. And the ""silly little things"" that can be the tip of an iceberg. Had a major EF a little while ago from glancing at an ad for martial arts classes. Best of luck to you and I hope you feel that you have more options and confidence than previously. Please do let us know how things go. Much love to you!"
1114,"Rain, your words felt like rain on a dry desert. I haven't talked to my therapist yet, I feel guilty that I find this important when there are real troubles in the world. But then on the other hand my children and husband are my world and where I have been put in this life, and if I can't give them my best because my mind is somewhere else then I would really like to fix that. Also I don't want to turn out like my mother who always talked about her past and how she was treated. Something I avoid telling my own children ( unless they ask).I also think my T must be pissed off for me mucking her around, it's about the 3rd appointment I've cancelled. Flookadelic yes control is an issue, thank you for your deep insight on this and Rain and SC thank you for emphasising SC's point about small feelings might only be the tip of the iceberg. I think I will talk to my T about everything in a week and a half as that is a good time my husband has a couple of days off and can be with the children. I will let you know how it goes, thank you for your interest and replies. I feel like giving you each a big hug.   "
1115,"Quote from: Annegirl on January 10, 2015, 10:10:29 AMI feel guilty that I find this important when there are real troubles in the world./quote]That's like feeling emotionally guilty for having a bad flu when there are people dying of cancer or war. It's important because it needs to be processed, and it's important because it can be solved. Speaking from a Jungian (not a scholar of Jung, here, just a patient of a Jungian) perspective: if you deny the reality of your troubles, then your troubles will become real in a way that becomes out of the capacity of the psyche to recognize and manage.QuoteI don't want to turn out like my mother who always talked about her past and how she was treated. Something I avoid telling my own children ( unless they ask).That kind of reminded me of that Broadway show Next to Normal, where the daughter wonders if her parents ""love each other or if they just fake it"" which I think was a tragic side-effect of the parents holding back on a shared tragedy for which they basically had a baby to try to get over it: the daughter character doubted family love, fell victim to perfectionism just to feel worthy of existence, became drug-addicted and angry all the time...not that being honest to the point of telling her, ""you should know we never really wanted you"" would have been better; but being honest, and compassionate, some balance between that might have saved an innocent life a lot of grief. As these things do.QuoteI also think my T must be pissed off for me mucking her around, it's about the 3rd appointment I've cancelled.Would you be able to tell your T that, directly? ""I keep thinking you must hate me for making appointments and cancelling."" A good therapist would (having understood in the first place about mental instability from emotional inconsistency) probably be able to take you over to the real reason why."
1116,"Thank you ELLY! You are amazingly insightful. I have never studied Jung but it your perspective is deep and makes a lot of sense. Yes the perfectionism, I never saw it like that either but it keeps me in a catch 22 situation when it comes to expressing my feelings. I always believe they are not worth discussing at all. Thank you for your reply. "
1117,"Very happy you have found us, Annegirl. I'm not the best read person on the topic even though I have cptsd...will be ordering Pete Walkers book this week...has anyone recommended his site to you yet? There are some excellent extracts from his work available free. But as I said, I'm not the best read and my experience of therapy has been slight. So I am relieved and delighted that my humble suggestions have been helpful. I struggled alone for so long but have found simply being understood to be a source of relief and affirmation. It is such a help. "
1118,Thank you so much Flookadelic. I will certainly look up his site. I have read his book and it is very good. I am sure you will discover some good information in there and hopefully most of it will be helpful to you.  
1119,"Other than you folks and my H and T of course, I haven't told anyone about having CPTSD.  I was just working on a piece about how to talk to children about personality disorders over at OOTF and realized that while my H and I have talked to my son about PDs I have not told him about my CPTSD (he is 22 and has been away at university since I was diagnosed). I do plan to at some point but it got me to wondering if any of you have told your kids/family/friends, how you went about it and did/does it help with your recovery at all?"
1120,I have told many of my condition with mixed results. I suppose the secret was forced by legal action more than a conscious choice. I wish I could explain things better but I find that I am unable to supply an understanding.
1121,"I have talked to my T and my boyfriend and a few friends that I knew would understand about it. I told my dad too. Provided him with the link from OOTF. I actually got a very favorable response from him. One that I wasn't expecting at all. He's being very supportive. Although, I am still working through my feelings about him and having him in my life again. I was NC with him for five years, and sometimes, I'm still suspicious about how much he really is supportive about certain things or if it's just that he wants me to continue talking to him. *shrug*"
1122,"Just my partner,and best friend because they have similar backgrounds and understand...and my T...I would like to talk to my sister but am not very good at opening up with her. Not the best listener..."
1123,"You guys, my h and my T (...well, she told me, actually  ).I was diagnosed with CPTSD 2 years ago but treated for PTSD 14 years ago. Back then, I had tried to talk to some people I thought I could trust about it - seeking validation, I guess - but it backfired (....knowing what I know now, I was surrounded by lots of Ns and fell for their fake sympathy act...). So this time, no way José!I didn't tell my kids, either, but for different reasons: I want them to grow up and not have to feel responsible for my wellbeing. Growing up, figuering out who you are and what you want to be is hard enough without having to shoulder adult responsibilities at a young age, so I sought help from professionals and understanding from other grownups (h and you guys) instead."
1124,"Another trust buster...nothing bites like confiding in someone and then you hear ""but, you know, you have that ""thing""..."""
1125,"That's why I don't tell people. My husband knows, and one friend, who listened and asked a few questions, but hasn't talked to me about it again (you know, to ask how I'm doing etc). Not a bad reaction, I know, but not really a very good one either. I think I'll just keep it to myself. "
1126,"I've decided to come out in a big way this year. My husband and I sent out an e-mail last night letting about 15 friends know about my diagnosis of PTSD (my therapist agrees with the complex part, but obv. can't put that on the insurance forms) and so far we've had nothing but warm and loving responses.I think that putting complex trauma in context for people takes a lot of intentional work. I'm happy to share the e-mail (with some details anonymized) if other folks are considering doing a coming out on that scale."
1127,"I'd be interested Milarepa, it helps to know how others go about telling people in their lives. I don't have too many I would tell actually, just my son and we're waiting until he's done school as he has more than enough on his plate and he doesn't really see/experience my symptoms so there's no need really. Your mention of not claiming on the insurance forms piqued my interest. I'm going to start a thread in the Community Matters forum about what we want to tell others about CPTSD and in this case our medical insurance/government/medical community about well many things but in particular about getting CPTSD covered. Could you post a little about that in one of those threads? I'm not sure where exactly to start on that issue but I know it is a big one for the US and was/is for Australia too if that artist's site I posted is anything to go by. "
1128,About a month ago uNPDH told me he was going to commit me...   so I have not told anyone! I did tell roommate of daughters about my EF the other day though...I wished I could tell him... after all he triggers me a lot!
1129,"These days, except for the forum, and others I know dealing with a similar situation, there is no one do I share my Journey to recovery with.Badmemories, I am so sad you are dealing with a uNPDH.   Threatening to commit ...gracious, isn't that straight out of the 1800s?!    It makes me angry you are being threatened!    Yeah, not safe to share."
1130,"Sorry to hear that your siblings and neighbours were not receptive BH    I guess it's the kind of info a lot of people don't quite know what to do with and don't know much about. I know after trying to tell people about my PD FOO and my own problems because of it I became quite gun shy after a complete lack of validation and in some cases having blame and guilt heaped on me. Much of that has to do with not having the language before to tell others what we're going through or at least that was the case for me. The other part is that the impact of emotional abuse (which underlies all abuse imo - sexual and physical, and neglect) on children was and still is not common knowledge yet.  It's also not a subject most societies want to deal with so it will be an uphill journey getting it more out in the open I think.   I know that you're quite concerned as am I about interrupting the cycle of abuse in future generations BH and I think we have the opportunity here to contribute much in that regard given we can clearly speak to the impact of childhood abuse and neglect, and to the importance of government/legal/medical/mental health professionals and society opening up about the issue and putting in place appropriate prevention and treatment options. OK, climbing down off my soapbox now  PS - On a personal level,  I've started thnking about what I want to tell our son about my CPTSD thanks to everyone's input to this board and I think I will be ready when the time comes.  Tks all    "
1131,"Excellent post, Kizzie.You got me thinking on something I have often thought about in the last few years, that with the internet, children of today who are inside abusive homes look in the internet for what is happening to them ...at least some of them would."
1132,This has me thinking about a deeper level email to my sis. She thinks she's fixed from ACoA counseling 30  years ago...nawt! ! Pete's book may be an excellent surprise gift.
1133," Rain- great idea for discussion! Can you maybe start a thread in the ""Community Matters"" forum so we capture ideas/thoughts there? (something along the lines of ""What do we want parents/children to know about abuse/neglect and CPTSD?""  or ""What can we do to be involved in preventing childhood abuse and neglect?).  GT - Now that would be quite the surprise Xmas gift lol.  You just never know, she just might be open to some discussion about it. "
1134,"As a result of T today, I had a mild panic attack around the idea of being with other people and letting my emotions show, sharing my opinions, etc.  I have made some small progress in this area (e.g. I am more comfortable with posting opinions that may be controversial online) but the thought of being more open IRL still freaks me out.  And yet I don't have what I consider to be true social anxiety, by which I mean I don't get anxious at the thought of being around others or unduly anxious about new situations, meeting new people, etc.  I dislike almost all social situations and make myself go to them rather than wanting to go to them, but I'm not scared or panicky about them, if that makes sense.  I only get anxious in the middle of the night following the social occasion, when I wake up and am convinced that I said/did something wrong and everyone thinks I'm an idiot.So I was thinking that maybe what keeps me from having full-on social anxiety is that I am always medium chill.  I invented MC on my own as a child and I am MC with everyone most of the time.  This lets me be around people without doing the things that scare me like expressing my opinion.  If there's more than one other person around, I'm mostly silent, and even if it's one-on-one usually the other person does the majority of the talking.My T suggested that I do an exercise called ""morning pages"" from The Artist's Way (I will have to tell Sandpiper at OOTF, she's always recommending that book) in hopes that it will help me to be more expressive, emotionally and in general.  The idea (I think) is that you have to write 3 full pages every morning, on anything, without editing or crossing things out, just stream-of-consciousness."
1135,"Quote from: Rain on September 23, 2014, 05:58:20 PMYou know, I could copy and paste your own words with a new post that has my name on it.    I am going through this also.    And, this is fairly new with the extent of these symptoms for me.   This is the ""people are dangerous"" symptom.  Meeting other people's needs in over listening, which is a defensive technique as to not expose ourselves.   All the crap that NPD / BPD mothers force on their children.   Gracious, our mothers were dangerous.   How pathetic is that? I had to listen to my mom's monologues, I'm guessing you did too.  As a teen I thought that's what my purpose in life was, to listen to other people and understand them.I had gotten slightly better with socializing after starting T, but it seems to be something that comes and goes based on how much I'm dealing with my emotional backlog.  If I'm in the middle of dealing with old emotions, I want to hide; but oddly, I've noticed recently that if I deal with intense emotions early in the day and then have time to recover from the resulting exhaustion, I'm more able to be friendly and socialize.QuoteI think this is what ""healing"" looks like with CPTSD ...complex.  Panic attacks and all.Maybe it is like our lives on ""rewind"" with a cassette player.    This crap unwinds out of our bodies as we are able to deal with, and only WHEN we are able to deal with it.I think so.  I have a definite feeling of getting a little piece at a time to deal with.QuoteI have taken a year plus off to deal with this ""crap unwinding"" which has me showing anxiety, panic attacks, symptoms I have never seen before in me!I have a theory, based on what others have said, that those of us with CPTSD get to the point where we just can't anymore -- we have been running and doing, taking care of parents, siblings, ourselves, trying to be ""good enough"" and avoiding the emotional baggage we carry for so long that we finally sort of break down and have to either heal or go bonkers.I get what you are saying about the weirdness of it all -- I can't get over the weirdness of feeling emotions about long-past events that I had no idea I felt, yet I can tell I felt it all along.QuoteHopefully there is an end to all this ""crap unwinding"" ....I have to think there is.   I do know that I cannot keep carrying this trauma inside me ...I'm on constant ""alert"" without even knowing it through all these years.   I have a good friend who is in his 70s and had a verbally abusive mother, and he told me recently...I couldn't remember exactly, so I had to look it up, and here is his quote: ""After a time of rest, maybe your mind feels strong enough to work on it all again? I hate to say this, but I feel you won't be able to stuff all this back into the box for long, and will have to deal with it. As a ""survivor"", let me tell you that the calm seas are worth battling the storm.""QuoteThe Inner Critic has made sure to keep me in crisis mode all these years slamming me with my parent's negative programming, so I am heavy duty crushing the critic.   Currently, I have banished him to the Moon! (he talks and I cannot even hear him as there is no sound on the Moon ....hahaha!).Ha, good image!QuoteI'm sorry we are both going through this.   I soooo relate to your ""mild panic attack"" on the ""idea of being with other people"" ...sounds like your therapist wants the ""relational healing"" bit.   Hard to do that without people...     I don't think so, we were talking about me being more emotionally expressive in general, she wasn't pushing socializing but the idea of letting myself feel more joy, pain, etc.  We were talking about how much I smile (or not) and how my DD is impacted by my and DH's relative lack of emotion.  (DH came from a similar family dynamic, having to be the mature person because his F was not.)  And I realized that I have a hard time with letting myself be joyful, spontaneous, etc. and in talking about that we also talked about how I have a hard time showing any emotions around people.  I smile more freely when I'm by myself, etc.  The only thing she actively encouraged me to do was the writing exercise, and that was because the meditation exercise she suggested previously wasn't working out.  I think she's more of a ""let's try to find something that works for you"" sort of T.QuoteHowever, I like what Pete Walker writes in Surviving to Thriving book, that there are some people so betrayed that asking them to be with people is additional trauma ...that the relational contact though online groups, authors, pets ...safe venues ...are relational healing.   He has seen success with that.I agree.  I was recently in a discussion about social anxiety on an unrelated forum, and people with anxiety (that didn't seem to be from CPTSD) were saying how helpful it was for them to have an outlet like a forum.QuoteMedium Chill ...being safe.   I so understand.    Be gentle with yourself ...as I so try to be also.   This is serious crap we are recovering from.Thanks.  I know to be gentle with myself, but to hear it from someone else, to know that someone else understands and is patient with me, means a great deal.  DH and I host a small group study in our home every other week, and just doing that has been exhausting lately.  He's made some friends that he wants to have over, and I want to have them over too, but I'm tired just thinking about it, especially when our weekends have been so busy lately with our small group and other activities.  Hmm, maybe I don't know to be gentle with myself after all."
1136,"Sounds familiar, yes. I'm glad to hear you're moving forwards, and sorry that it involves so much pain. Being in group situations is difficult for me, too. I stopped being myself when I was about fifteen years old, and consciously molded and reworked myself into a persona that my mother and classmates wouldn't emotionally abuse. I've been that persona for decades. It makes social interactions exhausting - I'm always carefully choosing to do and say what will protect me from abuse. Then there's the ""people are dangerous"" thing.I did the morning pages thing once. It didn't work for me. The reason is, freely associating about all kinds of things are what I do disassociate. I'm a Freeze Type. I can freewrite for ages without ever getting close to an answer. What I do instead now is this. Every day, I write down how I feel. It's from a text on Childhood Emotional Neglect, and actually, one is supposed to do this three times a day, but I'm not the world's most disciplined person in that aspect, so I'm simply doing as much as I can. It's helped loads. It makes me focus on the here and now, which prevents my usual flights of fancy. Another thing is a technique that has to be rather well known. They even have books on it in our local bookshop, and goodness knows they're only ever storing stuff that's already popular. It's called the Inner Team technique. Basically, you relax, and then freewrite a dialogue between the different parts of your psyche. It's changed my life. My Inner Critic turned out to be actually my creative side trying to protect me by warning me of danger. Freewriting about this is fun - you come up with all kinds of mental images for things. So after a year or two, my Inner Critic had a raygun which he used to blast introjects, and then he'd open a door in the ceiling, and a vacuum would suck the introjects out into... actually, not into space, but into the sewer system of Ho Chi Minh city, which came a little out of left field. A part of me must see this as the epitome of ""REALLY far away"". (While I'm writing this, I'm getting worried that someone might try this at home and get flattened by a huge flashback. Not sure if this is simply my usual tendency to worry... but be that as it may, keep yourselves safe. I have NO idea if this is supposed to work with CPTSD; I developed my method for myself, starting with a brief exercize in a book on writing.)Those two things have been invaluable. Most times, it feels as if a dislocated joint has clunked back into place. "
1137,"People who who talk and talk and talk used to trigger me into really angry EFs of feeling trapped listening to someone who likes to hold court.       I actually quit a course about five years ago because my small group was dominated by a ""hog the stage"" woman. I would come home seething and I dreaded going because I was so angry and afraid I was eventually going to explode. So I quit. I did know that it was because of my past history with being talked over, shut down, ignored in my FOO so that was a step in the right direction - I just didn't know what to do about it.  I felt bad that I had wasted money and had let this woman who I would probably never see again drive me away from something I was enjoying.  In hindsight I realize she likely had a PD given her demand for attention and that there was a lot about her that was triggering given my reaction.  I did the kind thing for myself because I didn't understand what an EF is or what to do about it.  Not to take away from the pain that being invisible causes for us, but talking about sending your IC to the moon Rain made me think of a great video by comedian Brian Regan that someone posted at OOTF and really made me laugh, a ""right from the toes,  full body engaged laugh"" which was great. I like knowing that it's just not my CPTSD that makes it hard to deal with ""Me Monsters,"" most people feel trapped around people who are like this and don't know to deal with them.  Here's the link - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBJ6yptGqm4Oh to walk on the moon. "
1138,"Ahh, the ""people are dangerous"" symptom. Yes. Sharing my emotions or opinions is generally a terrifying thought. I had to listen to my M's diatribes, and be ready with the correct 'opinions' to add to the conversation. Reassuring her that I see the world the same way she does, and essentially inflating her ego.Conversations feel like landmines to me. Learning to have a conversation without sharing an opinion is something I'm working on. Sounds weird that it terrifies me to share an opinion, and yet I have to learn not to. When I talk to someone I read them. Then I say what I think they want to hear. So I never share MY opinions, but feel I have to inflate their ego by agreeing with them. I think this turns nonPD people off, and attracts PDs, the opposite of what I want.I have made progress though. Last time I saw my in-laws I expressed my opinion that I knew they would not agree with. It caused me anxiety, but the world did not end(as I always feel that it will). I've known them for 20 years, and they are very kind, they are not perfect, but they are safe and caring.I like the thought of using MC when I don't feel safe with people. I think I will try that.I had not made the association of feeling trapped by someone who talks and talks. WOW! Might explain why I sometimes want to scream at my FIL, who tends toward aspergers-esque monologues."

BUT I DID IT    I was so worried but I hadn't seen My GS since he was a baby, so I was gong to do it no matter what!I have a theory, based on what others have said, that those of us with CPTSD get to the point where we just can't anymore -- we have been running and doing, taking care of parents, siblings, ourselves, trying to be ""good enough"" and avoiding the emotional baggage we carry for so long that we finally sort of break down and have to either heal or go bonkers.[/u]i guess this is the point that I am/was when I started to seek the internet for help...then I found OOTF. wow! what a wake up call! Now I am here also!  here is his quote: ""After a time of rest, maybe your mind feels strong enough to work on it all again? I hate to say this, but I feel you won't be able to stuff all this back into the box for long, and will have to deal with it. As a ""survivor"", let me tell you that the calm seas are worth battling the storm.""Honestly I HAVE worked on Myself a lot... I am just moving into a new chapter. It is like it all became clear to me about other people I was in relationships with. I can see now that I can't fix them. I can't help them anymore! I have to start taking care of Myself.Posted by: schrödinger's cat« on: September 23, 2014, 12:35:39 PM »What I do instead now is this. Every day, I write down how I feel. It's from a text on Childhood Emotional Neglect, and actually, one is supposed to do this three times a day, but I'm not the world's most disciplined person in that aspect, so I'm simply doing as much as I can. It's helped loads. It makes me focus on the here and now, which prevents my usual flights of fancy.  It's called the Inner Team technique. Basically, you relax, and then freewrite a dialogue between the different parts of your psyche. It's changed my life. My Inner Critic turned out to be actually my creative side trying to protect me by warning me of danger. Freewriting about this is fun - you come up with all kinds of mental images for things. So after a year or two, my Inner Critic had a raygun which he used to blast introjects, and then he'd open a door in the ceiling, and a vacuum would suck the introjects out into... actually, not into space, but into the sewer system of Ho Chi Ming city, which came a little out of left field. A part of me must see this as the epitome of ""REALLY far away"". (While I'm writing this, I'm getting worried that someone might try this at home and get flattened by a huge flashback. Not sure if this is simply my usual tendency to worry... but be that as it may, keep yourselves safe. I have NO idea if this is supposed to work with CPTSD; I developed my method for myself, starting with a brief exercise in a book on writing.) These both sound useful! Posted by: bee« on: Today at 11:57:36 AMI have made progress though. Last time I saw my in-laws I expressed my opinion that I knew they would not agree with. It caused me anxiety, but the world did not end(as I always feel that it will). I've known them for 20 years, and they are very kind, they are not perfect, but they are safe and caring. Sounds like You are working on healing!  "

1142,"Quote from: Badmemories on September 26, 2014, 10:40:07 PM... getting another perspective on things ruminating through You mind helps. Being with My Grandaughter helps a lot for me too. Sometimes I get reminded of what My childhood was like comparing it too what I see in My grandaughter's life. I realize even more how messed up My childhood was... I see things in Myself that were caused by pd parents. She is 7 now... My Mother left me home for short periods of time with My 2 siblings by the time I was 5, I can't imagine that now seeing how immature My GD is at 5  So being with GD is a blessing to me.  I experienced something similar with my daughter - how even as a bigger kid she needs me more than ever. Of course she's very independent now, and our relationship has changed to allow for that, but I'm still there as a kind of basecamp she can come back to for comfort, protection, soothing, and maybe even to be babied a little (in the way of her own choosing). At times she asks me questions or talks about things that I just know she'd never ask anyone else. So I don't have to feel defective for having needed my mother ""even though I wasn't little anymore"". If ever we do a resources page, I suggest we get together and write down what a normal family life looks like. So many of us have grown in dysfunctional or otherwise unusual FOOs, and maybe our standards are so out of whack that we still think that even some of our weirdest past experiences are normal? "
1143,"One of the crazy things going through My head NOW is this: I think this happened before I was in school. I had a cough, I don't remember if I had a cold? I was having those coughing fits like a person gets at night. I remember My UnpdstD yelling at her  ""Can't You do anything to get her to sleep""  I remember her trying at least one thing that didn't work..(honestly IN My house I always have cough medicine and cough drops for MY kids/GChilden) I remember being scared that if I didn't quit coughing I was going to get spanked( or whatever the flavor of the day was) Then He told her to give me salt that might work. So she gave me a big spoon of salt! I tried and tried not to COUGH... i WAS AFRAID IN MY BED. He was angry because I was keeping Him awake...No concern about how sick I was! So now looking at this as an adult. Why would someone give someone SALT to keep them from coughing? Salt Dries out things (beef jerky?making hams?, curing?) I mean that is just insane! i mean why Not syrup, or maybe sugar, why Salt? Salt is going to make it worse. I remember trying SO hard NOT TO cough! What a bad time the little girl in Me had trying so hard to do the impossible, Not to cough with Salt in her throat drying her throat up! Poor Girl!        "
1144,"oh, Badmemories ....that ""do not cough"" memory is heart wrenching.    Of course, the more you try not to do something, the more you just have to ...and freaking SALT!?    You needed a hug, some honey perhaps to slowly drizzle down your throat if there were not cough formula (great planning to not have cough syrup in the house, may I say).   And, there you were so afraid for getting punished for simply being sick, like any normal kid.   I am so sorry, badmemories.Child abuse comes in sooo many forms.    That was neglect, and abuse.   Scary."

1146,"Quote from: Rain on September 27, 2014, 11:58:10 AMOne thought I have is my wondering if your ""Inner Critic"" you describe above is actually your Adult You.     My Inner Critic Snarly is anything BUT creative and he does NOT protect me by shooting rayguns at introjects, instead Snarly my Inner Critic IS the problem that I want to CRUSH with the constant negative messages he drowns me with.I thought about this, and realized that, as I was telling the story, I unconsciously told it the way I lived it back then (almost six years ago). Texts on creative writing often talk about our ""inner critic"", and mean the one who gets in the way of our writing. So that's the guy with the rayguns. I'm sorry for being confusing. In my inner team work, several inner critics came up. Raygun guy was a creative, intuitive, half-subconscious part of me. He turned out to be really nice, though, and very protective. Then there was an inner critic who was as prim as Mary Poppins, and who criticized organizational stuff (punctuality, tidiness...). She turned out to be a somewhat ditzy part of me, a part I pictured as someone geeky-looking with glasses, who loves doing research. Then there was someone else who had specialized in attacking me personally, and who was very doom-and-gloom and ""all this will end in DISASTER"". She was later really helpful - very proactive, no-nonsense, a little bit strict and dry, but invaluable. So those were all good and valuable parts of me that simply got bent into pretzels by trauma. It was possible to get in touch with them, negotiate, and un-pretzel them a bit. I notice that stressful times pretzel them back to their old destructive selves, but it's easier now to un-pick the knots again. Mostly they profit from the same things our inner children need - simple reminders that this is 2014 and not 1984, that I'm a grown-up and not a kid, that we've got our own place and don't live at home anymore, etc. Also, paying attention to their needs and messages helps. My CPTSD inner critic is still very annoying and destructive, though. I get EFs daily, several times a day. In my inner team work, I pictured this sometimes as a whole world that kept sucking me back in. I called it Atropa World, after a poisonous plant. ... Never thought of that as a symbol for my Inner Critic before, actually, but it makes a lot of sense. Interesting. ... One time I got a powerful mental image of my psyche dealing with this ""bad"" world. Bit weird - there was a guy who could turn into a huge, HUGE planet, whose gravitational force was so powerful that it just overwhelmed the bad world. And then the planet turned inside-out and became a black hole, destroying the bad world completely. After that, it turned back into a planet, one that was at first empty, but then plants and things began to grow there, and it became beautiful. QuoteA firm ""shut up"" or telling the negative messages to ""go away"" does not work ...I have to CRUSH the little twerp...Same here. I tried your Mr Bill method this morning, after I had an EF. The EF was over, but I was still feeling a bit low, so visualizing my inner critic and then blasting a cannon at her cheered me up no end. Poetic justice. Closure. I got a sense of my inner kid being very content and grimly satisfied.By the way, this method works well for my two dd's. When they were little, we often imagined their ""stressed-out"" or ""worryworryworry"" feelings as critters. We pretended to catch them and then put them in a jam jar which we screwed shut. And then I told them to imagine there was a dial and a few buttons. If you press the buttons, whacky things happen to your critter: it becomes very big or very tiny, or it gets a clown's nose or fairy wings or duck feet, or it can only talk in quacking noises... (I got that idea from JK Rowling's dementors, so that was my version of the riddikulus spell). I forgot all about that until just now."

1148,"Glad you liked it. I have a somewhat overactive imagination. Daydreaming was always part of my Freeze response, so I got in plenty of practice."
1149," I have had the worse year of My life this year since December. It started in 2011, with uNPDSStarting Sept. 2011. My uNPDsis came here from a big city. I was working when she planned on coming. We were locked out of Ours Jobs at the factory in August before she came. She was planning on moving in Sept. I told her not to come as I was unemployed. She would not listen   I did not get unemployment. She moved in with 2 dogs and 3 cats, and nephew into a 2 bedroom trailer. They lived off of me and daughter until Daughter moved into a 4 bedroom apt. Then the original deal was for uNPDSis and nephew to pay something. They paid nothing. uNPDS did do babysitting. She hoarded up My daughters apt. He dog was a BARKER and she did nothing about it... Daughter had 3 evictions based on the fact that the dog barked so loud. Nephew moved into MY house with said dogs, and cats. Nephew did not find work until May 2012. When He found work.. they spent all the money and still did not pay for anything.  In fact D. let then use her extra van and they ran it until it lost transmission. (nephew is delivering pizzas) So me and daughter were buying everything for them. She did get a pension but SHE used it all for herself, giving nobody nothing. Background.uNPDS lived about 250 miles away. I would visit her. I always noticed that when I went I had to pay for food for her and nephew. They would get in financial trouble and I'd loan them money. (in the thousands all totalled.) I'd give her financial advice from a distance.. she'd say she was doing the things I suggested... later I figured out it was all a lie. She was not doing anything that I'd advised. Facts that made me crazy.I did eBay for a while, and uNPDS had lots of things to sell. I told her I'd help her and teach her how to do it...first boundary I set up. She did not like that, but she did not want to learn. Her and nephew got a liability suit settled and received $5,000. I needed Money for house taxes. I ask to borrow $400. No she said to me... ""You will have to do like I did and ask everyone for help to get the taxes paid."" first alarm goes off :stars:I'd given her money to pay her taxes at least 3 times. So she is living off of me a D. and she can't borrow me $400. when I borrowed her thousands for said thing. They broke My microwave.( nephew punched it in fit of anger.) Phone system. They put it by the sink and base fell in sink. Never offered to pay for THEY BROKE. I lost carpets, walls, and who know what all in My income property..after they moved out it was unrentable without a lot of work.June 2013. I started working in May after 22 months Locked out. I went to job and worked as much as I could Nephew and pets, moved in My house to keep My daughter from getting evicted from her apt. The pipes were not working. I had just moved out of house and left it when Son was in Iraq. (I had a nervous breakdown.) I told her and she agreed that I'd give them 4 months free rent to clean the house and move the stuff in My bedroom. After that rent would be $150. per month.   Nephew could help me fix pipes and house would be livable. I bought $500. stuff to redo pipes. Asked Nephew to call me on one of his days off and I'd get them fixed! Nephew would NEVER CALL ME worried me sick that he was living in House without water. I had 2 weeks off one in Nov around thanksgiving. Told Nephew we'd fix pipesafter thanksgiving. uNPDS gets mad at me Thanksgiving and told everyone we did not invite them!   Finally got that somewhat made up and say I am going to do pipes week between Christmas and New Years. uNPDS starts another argument all a pack of lies, so couldn't fix pipes then.  Then I am retired in Jan. I tell her I am going to fix pipes in Jan. She makes up a bunch of lies again. Now she is living in My house 15 months and not paid a dime. She says ""well You have to pay the payment anyways so why should I pay you?"" The house is unlivable so why should I pay you. ( I gave them $600. to clean the house.)I ask them to leave and gave them a 60 day notice to be out by Aug 31,. She has had me on silent treatment since June. I have to file the eviction notice. Very depressing how all this has gone for me. I have been putting stuff in the house to move there when I leave uNPDH. I have everything valuable in there. I am afraid she is stealing. I hate that She has used me like this. I realized that Our relationship all these years was based on ME giving and giving to her. when I started setting various boundaries then she has NO use for me. I think these problems with her has made My CPTSD worse or at least brought out NEW things to deal with...lots of FOO. So this is part of the stress I am going through. "
1150,"Oh yikes. Can you divorce your sister? So she used your generosity, never gave anything in return, didn't stick to agreements you made, dodged out of having to explain herself properly, used excuses and rationalizations, said mean things about you behind your back, and generally drained you of energy and money and resources? Oh man. No wonder you're feeling low. Maybe this sounds callous, but I wish she will leave soon and stay very far away from you for a looong time. Take care of yourself, you hear? I hope things will start to get better for you soon.  "

1154,Yes i sure will!
1155,"We have two guys living with us, we are helping them out, one is a very longstanding friend who was adopted at two yrs old in NZ from Thailand ( he was found in a box on police doorstep when born) and one is an Afghani refugee who saw many cousins and family members etc killed in front of him by Sunni Muslims. Thankfully his parents are fine and well living in Pakistan ( where my husband is from, although my dh is not Muslim this guy is. I have been thinking about him as he definitely has CPTSD flight type and drinks quite a lot and is a workaholic too.I really love having these guys around and feel they are a blessing from G-d as the children really love them and they are like uncles as my bros or sisters and dh bros or sisters don't visit. They are also very relaxed and love the children a lot. I thought this morning how pathetic I am trying to fix my problems when they and dh have so much worse things to try and get over, then I realised each of them have supportive parents who ring up and encourage them or they ring their parents who actually support them with their words. This made me see how much us humans can get through if only we have supportive parents. I am wondering if having anyone supportive helps just as much, I know when my T started supporting me and my dh when he supports me it helped a lot, but my T is working on that we can be at peace and happy with ourselves no matter who is there for us or not. But there is always the isolation feeling that I am not a part of my immediate family, my brother has been to visit (fly from Aussie to NZ already 4-5 times this year) and he lives 5 hrs drive from me and I haven't seen him once. Although he said he's coming for my b'day..... But then my younger bro said he's coming and then he didn't come. But he has come once so maybe I shouldn't compare. But my T said siblings should be closer to each other than parents."
1156,"I think your observation of how much people can go through/handle when they HAVE support is true. It makes me sick to think about how little support I ever had including now. I think I have one person who gives a crap about me and that's it. That just isn't enough. It's absolutely not fair imo, to expect people to be strong and individual without a support system. Look at any strong individual and you can see. No one does anything on their own, altho some of them think they do.  It's not really fair to yourself to compare the guys and their lives to yours. I'm sure you already know that. Try not to let the inner critic make you feel bad about it.And I don't know what I think about your T saying siblings should be closer. Everyone is a separate person and so you never know who is going to be close with who. I wouldn't like someone saying that to me because Id feel like a total failure (my only sister and I never had a relationship due to the conditions of the house, and we are both in our 40s now, completely estranged.) "
1157,"Yes, you are right Pam about the inner critic, I need to keep reminding myself Thank you. and I suppose my T wasn't meaning there was any hard and fast rule about it. She generalised and said normally it is the adult who initiates contact with their parent and the siblings generally contact one another more. But in dysfunctional families its all over the place."
1158,"Lots of times I quit relationships, jobs because I wanted to get away from certain people that made me afraid. Something you said Kizzie that those people triggered you and made you have flashbacks. Now I realise that's what was happening.

But when my daughter got up to get a drink of water while she was reading she said something like "" don't get up again"" and I freaked out and told her that we won't do the story reading but she can come to my daughter's birthday ( because I knew my husband would be home)Now she doesn't come anymore, which I am relieved about but also confused because I know she meant well."
