I guess i’m sorta venting to strangers,1,mlr0dn,0,"i know i’m only 16 so this, in other people’s eyes, just seems like “easy to get over” sorta problems compared to everyone else. also excuse the janky layout i’m typing on my phone right now.

anyways. when i was 14 in autumn of 2019, i started talking to this girl in my year that recently pulled out of school and we ended up in a relationship blah blah blah. she broke up with me when i got to my dads (out of town) after my grandads funeral and things haven’t been good since. it feels like i changed who i am for her and i can’t go back to who i used to be. i’ve tried not dating and also dating but nothing works. every word of every song i listen to brings back memories of sneaking out to go to her place. we didn’t even do anything we just cuddled and it’s the slow, simple things that i miss. we barely even kissed  a lot. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. it seems pointless. i just hope someone out there can help out. i’m hopeless and i just don’t see a way out.


yes i have told her how i feel etc etc but to not avail. she moved on a week or two after we broke up as well which i guess what a year of a relationship with me does. sorry for rambling"
Every Second that goes by is another second that I let someone down,1,mlr00a,0,"Every moment that I sit with myself in pain and sadness is another moment that I let someone I love down. I don't know what I want of myself anymore.  I'm having trouble remembering what I was so hopeful about in the past. My brain feels fried. People tell me ""there is hope,""... but hope for what?"
melancholy,1,mlqzhh,0,"i wouldn’t ever downplay anyone’s struggles, especially when it comes to suffering mental illness. but sometimes i envy those who have situational depression.. you know like the people who suffer “depression” because of a culmination of bad luck and less than ideal lifestyles.

because i don’t have a lot to complain about, but for some reason i have an aching pit in my chest and a silent, empty brain. i don’t know where my will to live went. i used to dream about my future but i don’t even know how to feel better at this point. i just feel like having crying spells all day, while at the same time i am screaming at myself in my head “WHY CAN’T YOU JUST BE HAPPY” i feel lifeless, dull, lost.

and the worst part is i don’t even feel like i deserve to feel this bad, but i literally. can’t. help. it."
Why am I not getting better?,1,mlqx9x,0,"I’m struggling. Bad. I can’t get out of bed nor can I sleep. I spend all my time watching tv for escapism and I can tell it’s really grating on my boyfriend. 
I’m taking medication and have been for a while but it makes me feel numb. I talk to a councillor and I’ve been signed off work for over 2 months now. 
I am about to quit my job without another to go to and I’m freaking out. There’s no jobs out there and I want to do my own thing, but how can I do that when I can’t even get out of bed?? Any tips?"
I am a female stalker,1,mlqwhj,2,"

Don’t even know what I’m looking for or why I’m posting but comment whatever you like, if you feel like it. Maybe someone has some insight because none of the therapy I’ve been in has helped much. 

I’m a woman in her early 20s. A couple years ago I became extremely obsessed (not primarily sexually though eventually it did become a romantic obsession) with a teacher of mine who was in his late 50s, married with children. He didn’t do anything to encourage me but he was really nice to me and we had things in common. I think he enjoyed my company too at least at first but obviously not as much as I did. I became totally obsessed, but knew it was immoral to do anything. I cried over him and dreamt of him and thought of him 90 percent of my waking hours. And long story short eventually became so obsessed that I would search the trash for things he’d thrown out. I  memorized his schedule and would try to bump into him. I misinterpreted some things and stupidly thought he felt the same about me. I looked everywhere for proof that he cared about me, even going through his papers in his office once. I looked at photos of his family and him every day. I tried to distance myself but even in another state after a year apart i thought of him every day. 

I’ve tried therapy and it helped some but I still cry sometimes, like tonight. I feel so angry and disgusted with myself because I know this is wrong but I want to google him and see his picture. I feel like my head is on fire, 5 years later. I haven’t spoken to him in over a year and we aren’t even real friends. He’s just being nice. He’s probably creeped out by me. I hate myself I just want him. I hate my brain. I feel like a baby that just wants it’s mother.... I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why therapy isn’t helping. I’m sure it’s my own fault but I can’t do this anymore."
I feel completely useless,1,mlqvpe,0,"I’m an autistic teenager (don’t remember exactly where I am on the spectrum) and I just don’t feel like I can do anything right. Because of my Autism, I have an immensely hard difficulty with improving at anything. I’ve tried for years to become a better drawer, but my skills have stayed relatively the same for years. (And they aren’t even that high) Every new hobby I try, I suck at, no matter how much time and effort I put into it, and because I suck at it, I don’t enjoy that hobby and only get a feeling of uselessness. I don’t have a job or any friends because my Autism makes me extremely introverted and anti-social, (which is another thing I’ve tried and failed to change) I’m fat because I’m too depressed to work out, and I have constant headaches because of all of the stress. I feel like everything I do, I fail at, and even if I put years of effort in, I never improve. I don’t feel suicidal, but I feel like my life is worthless and that the world would literally be better off if I didn’t exist to consume resources. What should I do?"
Thinking of checking out,1,mlquny,4,"I've suffered with depression for about 16 years now. My husband brushes it off and doesn't choose to engage when I try to talk to him. I've always been nervous to actually ""take a rest,"" in a place because of the stigma. I spend most days in bed if I don't have work and can't bring myself to enjoy much anymore. It's been a long time coming. Has anyone checked into a mental health inpatient program and had good results?"
Hey are there any groups here so we can talk and give each other morale support so we can slay our demons and work on becoming happy again.,2,mlqnkw,0,Hey I am wondering if anyone has made a group or if anyone would join if I made a group. I am also battling deep depression and talking to people that are going thought the same pain as me I think would be very helpful. We can support each other and give each other morale support.
should I tell the psychiatrist what I think I have?,2,mlqmdd,2,"I am very sure that I have depression, my symptoms match. Tomorrow I'm going to the psychiatrist, should I tell him straight away what I think I have or should I just tell my symptoms?"
So difficult to not kill myself..,4,mlqm4q,3,"Not here for 'attention' Not here to hear 'everyone is beautiful you'll be loved one day"" ""just be confident"" bla bla bla. Fuck off with that shit please. Im just tired of life. I feel like it would be so damn pleasurable for me to just end my life. I'd never have to wake up to this stupid ass torture existence. No professional can fix me being ugly, depressed, other mental illnesses. All they do is empty the wallet and repeat what i say, give useless coping mechanisms, and steal my money. Fuck them. I hate life. I think life is actually hell. I was ignored my whole life growing up, i have nothing in me to be interesting so i'll be alone forever. I have anhedonia or whatever you call it. Nothing is pleasureable, nothing makes me happy, nothing excites me. So everything is simply suffering. I hate that I have to keep living, i hate it. Been depressed way too long.."
"I'm about to break it off with someone who made me feel really happy for a short while, and it hurts.",4,mlqlel,1,"It was nice while it lasted, and I felt really happy in the beginning. Butterflies in my stomach when reading her texts to me, visits every day, thoughts of going steady, the whole shebang. I couldn't stop thinking ""Where have you been all my life?"" and other stupid clichés I had written off as emotionally unavailable to me as a depressed person. It gave me a sense of being whole again. Love was made in the space between us.

And now it's gone. Last time I saw her it felt like none of the magic was there, and I was in the company of someone who didn't care. She had a bad day, my presence didn't matter and no connection was left. I could do nothing to cheer her up and I got none of the chemistry I adored in the beginning. We haven't spoken for a week. Tomorrow I'll have ""The Talk"" and clear out this gnawing feeling of uncertainty and dread. Then I'll be alone again. But I'll rather be on my own than with someone that makes me feel alone."
Tomorrow I go to the dentist and find out what the damage is.,1,mlqi8a,0,"I finally made an appointment to see what damage I've done due to my depression habit of not regularly brushing or flossing. That's very vague of me. Here's the truth: I brushed once a week and flossed once a month since the pandemic hit. I feel so ashamed of myself.

And I'm feeling like such a fool. My dental insurance only covers emergency surgery and I can't afford to have cavities taken care of, so I will be going into medical debt if I am not immensely lucky and scrape by cavity free. My anxiety is high as well as a result. But that's another matter.

I set alarms today to brush twice and floss once. I managed to do it, mostly because of how scared I am. But I certainly haven't undone whatever my oral hygiene looks like overall. Tomorrow I'll try to brush in the morning again then before my appointment I'll try to brush and floss.

No matter what I need to get a handle on my self-care habits. I only shower once a week. And it takes so much out of me. I need to figure out a way to manage to brush, floss, and shower regularly. I wonder if I'd feel less depressed if I found a way to take better care of myself.

I'm in treatment and on medication, but I still struggle with basics. I'm not even in a larger bout of depression at the moment. It's there but not as bad as it could be. I think that's why my prescriber and counselor aren't pushing for more changes.

I'm open to suggestions or encouragement, for sure. Thank you for taking the time to read.

TL;DR: I go to the dentist tomorrow to see what damage I've done by not taking care of my oral hygiene due to depression. Feeling ashamed, foolish, and scared."
How did this happen?,2,mlqg25,0,"For the first time in my life, I find myself having ""passive"" suicidal thoughts.  A slow-burning apathy has taken over, a shift in mindset toward the all-too-logical realization that it literally would not make a difference to me if I did not wake up tomorrow. You cannot miss what you do not have. 

I do not want to hurt myself, nor do I feel as though I would be better off dead.  I simply now perceive a quietness in death. The only reason I cringe at the thought is because I know my family would be devastated. I truly feel if no one in my immediate family were alive, I would not care if I woke up or not. 

The spooky (or not spooky?) thing about it is that while I recognize this is a change in thinking, I do I not care. It makes me wonder if ""this is how it starts..."" for people who become seriously ill. I know no one goes from 100% to shit overnight, for most it is a slow burn and that makes me worried about what's next. 

Who can relate?"
I'm slowly disappearing and I can't help it,2,mlqd3i,1,"I'm slowly disappearing and I'm too weak to stop it

My head hurts and I feel so empty and shallow as I'm typing this but today I fainted in front of my mom and everyone in the store i feel so disgusting 
god the look of disappointment on my mom's face and ppl giving me the pathetic and low key scared look I hate it I hate this body I'm not even that skinny so I'd look at my body and be like ok it's worth it this the only time my mom sees me like that so she thinks it's the first time 
The store manager saw me and told me that he know that I'm not eating and hurting myself cuz it's obvious and that he went through it too then he showed me his arms and they were full of scars bc of self harm and cutting he said a lot of nice stuff to me too 

I'm always scared of getting outside my house cuz I'm dead ass sure I'm going to feel so tired and sick I can't even do simple shit like taking a shower or cleaning my room without feeling like I'm about to pass the fuck out I even can't get a job bc I know I physically can't do it 
I'm pretty sure by now that my ed and depression r going to kill and I can't do anything about it"
"I can't go a day without thinking/saying ""I hate my life""",1,mlq8t6,0,"I recently released from the army to focus on college mostly because of mental health issues and inconvenient timings that don't blend well with my college schedule. The army felt like it made up so much of my identity that I don't know who I am without it. I think about the good times that I had but also the much shittier times. Both are hard to think about and it makes me really sad every day. Combined with the daily grind of college, it is really just taking a toll on my mental health.

""Time heals all sorrows"" they say, but this shit hurts so bad... I just want a break from life."
"I doubt I'll finish high school and I'm strangely fine with that, which worries me",1,mlq4f9,0,"Senior high school student here who's been having trouble with classes. I used to be a genius at school, I won so many awards back then in elementary school and I went to a high school for the ""super talented students"". I was pretty average compared to my peers but it wasn't a big deal to me since we were all intelligent in one way or another. But in the previous school year things went downhill fast. My depression which has shown signs back in elementary school has gotten very bad to the point that I'm barely able to keep up with studies. This school year I just cheat on pretty much everything by copying my classmate's works, from essays to math outputs. It has become pretty hard for me to retain information and focus on things. Recently a teacher made an announcement regarding how there's some cheating going on and that all people involved will be marked as zero. I'm guessing this is because I cheated on this activity where we're supposed to write a reflection talking about how this week in school went and what we learned in her subject. I can barely write anything cause I don't even study anymore and I just do less than the bare minimum.  


I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean but I can't even be bothered to save myself or struggle against the waves. I miss my old self who would at least try to succeed in school. I miss when I used to have ambitions in life and I wasn't just making decisions based on what would make me the least miserable in that moment. I miss when I wasn't a failure."
I have such a boring life that I'll get daydreaming confused for reality,4,mlq3g9,0,"I dont have the motivation to do anything so I day dream a lot, I'll daydream and get the motivation to prepare for an event... That I daydreamed"
my doctor is putting me on welbutrin,2,mlq36d,1,can anyone tell me your experiences with it? good and bad? im also on sertraline 200mg
How do you stop hating yourself?,2,mlq2cn,1,"I had depression for about 3 years between 2015-2018 and never once did I actually resent myself. More so I pitied myself, ran scenarios in my head constantly and distanced myself away from people into isolation and broke off key relationships and ran away to a different country... I was very much suicidal at that point.

The dark thoughts are coming back again, thoughts of suicide, but this time, I actually hate myself. I am very emotionally intelligent so for the last few years while I’ve felt down, I’ve managed quite well to overcome my struggles. This time, I actually have no fight in me because, as I’ve said, I hate myself therefore I feel like I deserve the misery I’m feeling.

Does this mean it’s time to stop fighting?..."
Please...,2,mlpvm7,7,"I'm staring into nothing again. I've went through another horrible day with my girlfriend. I love her more than anything but lately I keep forgetting why...
She's depressed and suicidal...she has lots of mental issues and I've always been there for her...yet one part of her mental issue is her split personality. At one second...she's so sweet and loving...and the next one she shouts at me how she wants me to die and then she cries and apologises. I can't handle this for too long anymore...going to her is starting to be so painful...I'm not even looking forward to it, as I'm more terrified of it. She keeps lying...shouting at me...and in the end, I always tell her ""It's okay. I know you don't mean this. We'll get through this together.""
But I'm depressed since...forever I guess.
I'm there for her, but she can't ever be there for me.
When I mention that I don't feel good it's just ""why would you?""
If I tell her that I feel like wanting to die...she just told me...""so?""
I'm starting to feel like she just uses me to be there for her...but we've been through so much for so long...planned to marry...I just don't know what to do. I know it would help me if I could just talk to someone about it, but she doesn't let me and threatens that she will cut if I talk to anyone but her. I'm so helpless...that's why I'm here begging for help..."
Help with depression,5,mlptok,2,
please help://,1,mlpuhj,0,"i don’t like asking for stuff i really don’t, but i need it this time. my mom, she is a single mom providing for 3 kids, if you’d like proof i can provide it. i don’t want you guys thinkin i’m just a kid asking for money but i’m not, i sincerely want to help my mom. it breaks my heart seeing her work doubles till 2–3 am everyday so us kids can have things. please i really really mean this please help me :/"
Helping Others,2,mlpuag,1,"Has anyone else been able to help others more than themselves? 
I often go to my mother’s and take care of all of her chores with no problem. But taking care of the same stuff at my house seems insurmountable."
A thought,3,mlpp8e,4,How come whenever you’re at your worst you’ll always give others the advice you’d want for yourself
Tonight IFU by re-reading old emails from my mother (deceased),1,mlpluq,0,"My mom and I were extremely close. She was my best friend. She passed away in 2009 at the age of 49 rather suddenly. Tonight I was going through my old email account to save what I wanted to save so I could delete the account since I no longer use it. I saw an email from my mom from the week before she passed. This led me to read ALL of our emails. Some good. Some not so good (while we got along great, we were both fighting our own personal battles at the time too, and that was hard to read). 

Anyways, two hours and dozens of emails later, I'm in really depressive funk. 

I don't really have a question or anything. I'm just alone at the moment and needed to talk about it. It's been 12 years and it still hurts."
I want to give up,3,mlpj6z,2,"I've tried to commit suicide twice in the last 6 months. Both times were unsuccessful. The first time I overdosed on prescription meds. The second I tried hanging myself but was too scared to complete it (which has made me feel like more of a coward for failing both times).

Anyway, I don't enjoy anything that I used to enjoy. I'm not an attractive man. I don't trust people friends or family. On the outside things may look good in my life (got a job, no debt, drive a average-nice car etc). But on the inside I'm hurting. People walk all over me at work. I could just quit my job sell all of my things and live on the street. I'd be no better or worse.

Ive felt stuck for a long time. I have no idea what to do."
Why?,2,mlphxp,0,She was the best thing that ever happened to me and I let her go because I couldn't work through some stupid fucking temporary long distance. I even asked her to get back together and she said she was over me. I feel so empty and I'm the only one to blame for it.
"I got genetic testing done, and finally have a reason for my depression",6,mlparg,0,"My genetic testing came back that I have ""significantly reduced folic acid metabolism"". My brain doesn't make neurotransmitters like it should. I know I had depression from a lot of traumatic events in my life, but now I know it's not just that.

After over a decade I have answers of why treatment never worked for me. And an answer to what's causing so many of my symptoms. There's a reason for all this. And a medication to help with the folic acid metabolism. I'm crying

Plus now we know what meds will work better for me because of my genetics. I didn't know this would change so much, and I really hope it's real"
It's sad to think about how I will die alone,2,mlpa4b,0,"I don't have much to say except how sad I think it is that I will die alone, hell I doubt anyone will notice if I am gone. If on the off chance someone did notice they wouldn't even care. I don't blame them, I am a defect of a human, I am meant to be alone. It only takes someone a few hours or maybe a day if I am lucky to see how worthless I am. No talents, no social skills, no stories, no personality, nothing. I haven't felt a real connection with a human in years if I really ever have, it hurts to think I will die completely isolated."
I want to just crawl into non-existence,4,mlp9ca,2,"The only thing that is keeping me from killing myself is the guilt that I will leave behind for the only person I have left in this world, my mother.  She was very happy living in our naïve country and she came to chase the very lies of the American dream just so that I could live a better life.  I never wanted to be born, I never wanted this life for me or for her. The constant pressure to make sure I can provide her with a better life is indescribable.  I wish she had a better son. I wish I could just crawl into non-existence and not have to have constant fear of the future or what is going to happen. I see everyone going to places and coming back, talking and toiling for reasons that I dont understand. I feel like I am chasing a goal that is never ending just to make sure I can provide her something of this life. I have chosen to exceed in academics and will be graduating with 200k loans from a doctorate school. I have always had an empathic style towards people and like helping others because I know what it is like to be at the very bottom. I know what is like to hear a doctor tell you over the phone that your mom has a cancer. I know what it is like to take your mom to dialysis machines 6 am in the morning just so that she can have her blood filtered out so that her body doesnt give out. I know what it is like to live in an apartment with rats crawling inside the walls. I know what it is like to look at your parent and lie to them and tell them everything is going to be okay but you know it wont. I know what it is like to keep begging insurance companies to cover medications because if they dont she will die. I know what it is like to take care of someone every single day while maintaining two jobs and going to full time school. I know what it is like to fake smile just to impress people so that you dont get fired from your job and pretend like everything is normal.  That empathic style with wanting to help others turned into embers and I dont know how much I can do this anymore.  Thank you for reading this far out. I know there are other people like here who suffer too and I hope for the best for u."
I hope I get diagnosed this time,2,mlp8xn,4,"19F here. This is sort of a throw away account I guess.

I finally booked an appointment for the gp (doctors) today. I told the receptionist that it's to check up on my mental health. I'm going to get a call on Friday. I'm kind of scared. I've always known there was something wrong with me. I think I'm depressed. I also think I have adhd but when I tried to get diagnosed a couple of years ago, they dismissed me because *I* was the one who thought I had adhd (as opposed to someone else like a parent or teacher which is so stupid because only I know what's going on in my head but apparently my own concern is not enough to be taken seriously 🙄) That's made me distrust doctors so I'm kind of worried they won't take me seriously again. 

I really hope I get diagnosed so that I can get treated. I hate where I am in life right now and I really wanna get better. It really sucks when you know something is wrong with you but other people don't believe you."
How do you deal with depression in quarantine?,1,mlp4hx,2,When i was younger i was fine with being alone all the time at home. Now all i think about it dying and negative thoughts and stress. There’s no fun in my life at all.
Impulse control issues on antipsychotics?,1,mlp4ch,0,"I’ve recently (within the past few months) started 1mg of rexulti and am having more urges to eat, drink, and kind of waste my money on stuff (food, collections, clothes) is this normal for being on antipsychotics or have I just gotten into some bad habits?"
22 and hopeless,1,mlp3kg,0,"I just need to vent. I’m so unhappy in my everyday life it’s becoming unbearable. I’ve been in therapy for 2+ years learning about myself, unpacking trauma, and of course learning how to cope with my depression and anxiety. I feel like I’ve tried to be happy and present in my life — but nothing works and when it’s all said and done I still feel worthless and alone. I don’t feel heard, seen, or valued by anyone in my life. I don’t feel like it would make a difference if I was here or not — the world is going to keep spinning regardless. It’s getting incredibly hard to see the point in any of this.

I’m in university and I thought I would be graduating in the winter semester of 2021 but today I found out I won’t be graduating until spring 2022. I feel like a failure because it’s taking me an extra semester to graduate. I’m so unhappy in college. Finding out today’s news means being broke for another year, and having to go through the mundane tasks and more irrelevant assignments that I won’t remember. My friend told me everyone starts to feel this away around their last semester/year of school, kind of like a ‘cabin fever’ to move on to the next phase of your life. I feel like there is no “next phase of my life”. I think this is such bad news because college is my biggest source of depression and stress. I’m exhausted, miserable, and  want to be done. 

I feel like I’m never going to be successful, happy, or financially secure. I spend my days trying to pull myself out of my negative thoughts and self-talk, it’s becoming increasingly hard for me to be present in the day or to get out of bed. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m exhausted from pretending to be okay and be happy, I just don’t want to be here anymore."
Too sad,2,mlp34n,0,"I feel like most days I’m on autopilot. I can’t do anything right. I’m a terrible mom, a terrible friend, terrible girlfriend. I don’t talk to my family because they’re absolute shit, I don’t really have any friends. My coworkers are the closest thing to me, but they have their own stuff going on. My body hurts all day every day because of all the stupid illnesses I tacked on after my second child was born. I’m hurting in all of the way. I used to be fit af, but gained 30 pounds during covid. 

I don’t want to be here. I’ve been thinking about it for two months, but it just gets stronger every day. I am lonely even with people. I don’t think I can be fixed. If I feel this way at 30, how will I feel at 50? 60? I didn’t think I’d be here this long, but here I am... still miserable."
No Motivation Help :/,1,mloxw7,1,Okay so I’m a college student and like the usual a lot of people go to me like oh you got nothing to be depressed about tbh with I’m fucking done with shit I need a brake I got all these pressure all these bs assignment due and I just do em to do em for the grade another thing is I’m depressed I have 0 motivation to do anything I’m being pressured to find a girlfriend and with this covid bs it’s hard af I literally spend Monday thru Friday trying to do homework and sit in my room I have nothing to do I have nowhere to go my friends are always busy during the week and another thing is that I CANT FUCKING MAKE NEW FRIENDS bc of my stupid anxiety I have hybrid classes 2 days I go to school 2 I don’t but still like I can’t talk to new people I feel that I am socially awkward I have 0 motivation to leave my house and I’m bing pressured to get a girlfriend by my parents and all my friends think something wrong with me. My only question is how can I get my motivation up I want to feel that I have accomplished something productive except homework and studying and how to deal with my anxiety in public anything will be helpful and thank you for reading my shitty paragraph :/
Afraid of emotions,2,mloxcy,0,"I have had high-functioning depression (hate that term but whatever) for a long time now, I don't feel intense sadness or suicidal thoughts, I just feel empty and purposeless all the time, like a living corpse. After working on it with a psychiatrist and making some lifestyle changes, I'm feeling much better, but I still felt like there is a missing link that I'm not grasping.

And then something happened today, and it made me angry - so angry that it surprised myself, because I have not felt such an intense emotion for so long, and I didn't even know how to handle it. I realized that because that constant emptiness has dominated my life for so long, I kinda forgot how to deal with emotions.

It's kind of scary though. Now that I'm aware of my emotions I will need to learn how to express and release them. But I feel like I would look foolish or childish. It doesn't help that I always try not be a burden for other people. I already feel guilty when I talk about my mental health to my friends…

Can anyone relate to this?"
I feel so alone,3,mloxc0,1,I’ve never had anyone and it hurts so fucking bad. I’ve never had any friends or relationships and it feels like I’m suffocating. The world feels so heavy. I don’t want to be alone anymore. It hurts even more because I know I deserve love. I know there’s nothing wrong with me and I have so much to offer. So why do I have to be alone? I don’t expect anyone to spend all of their time with me I just want someone to fucking care about me once in a while

I’m back again like Soulja Boy,1,mloweb,0,"I’ve made so many goodbyes to this sub and they’re never the last goodbye. I keep coming back to this sub and I’m hurting even more than the last time I was here. I’ve started smoking weed and I’ve actually taken a break 40 days ago. 

Since I smoked weed I had a grand time but it always followed with me digging up my earliest memories and  finding out why I suffer from anxiety and depression. Normally this would be a good thing now I know what the problem is but the fact I feel like there isn’t anything I can do about it makes it 10x worse. 

My parents never allowed me to visit a counselor until I gave them plenty trouble and had the police called on me. My parents are shitty but I feel like shit cause I know they love me but they just don’t know how to care for me. I know it’s not to late that why I haven’t ended it, but it’s getting harder and harder.

Any advice? I felt like I haven’t felt emotion outside of drugs since I was 8 years old and I’m currently 16 and passed high school."
I feel like I’m drowning while wearing an oxygen tank,1,mlouvu,1,"I got sent to a stress center after I attempted suicide two years ago. I’ve gotten to a point where I’m even lower than I was at my lowest. And yet, it’s so much more painful because I just don’t have the energy to die.

It’s honestly worse than being able to attempt. Because, I have the resources, I’m not afraid of death, I want to die- yet my exhaustion is so prominent that I’m simply to tired to end it all. I’m desperate to just leave yet sleep sounds so much better. I’m just so done with myself."
I think I need to go to a psychiatric hospital tonight but I can't drive and I'm scared of worrying my parents,9,mlous8,4,I'm not doing okay at all I'm worse than usual today for some reason and I think I need someone to watch me but I don't have a license and I don't think I should drive without one and if I call them to come get me it's gonna freak my parents out and I don't know what to do
i fucking hate myself,1,mlon01,0,"I think i may have a problem with gambling, i think im addicted. I have mental health issues, extreamly low self esteem. Everytime I start gambling, I feel horrible. I don't know how to deal with this problem, i have sudden urges for gambling at nights and its really bothering me. i lose almoast everytime, and i feel like cutting myself and dying. i dont know where to look for help. This is a big problem for me and i don't know how to overcome it."
Hurting,5,mlomzg,0,"When I was there for someone and they aren't for me. When I helped them during their mental breakdowns. No one is there for me. I'm hurting and no one cares.

What's my issue ?,1,mlomfe,0,"I'm 22 years old and since I was 17 I began experiencing mood swings of varying intensity. 

These mood swings are triggered by very or extremely negative things. The worst ones begin with a blind rage for a few minutes where I feel like I can't control myself and then sadness for a few months until it goes away. The most extreme ones have only happened 3 times.

After these triggers I feel less human and moral, like I'm eroding and becoming a human shell.
I cheated on my ex who left me for another person without guilt and lying has become something I do automatically.

I don't know what to do."
"I can't cope anymore. (13, he/him)",7,mlom46,1,"I can't. 
I've tried to calm myself down by playing guitar, and my Mum yelled at me because it's half 11, and too late. Fair enough. But now I feel worse.

I don't wanna eat, I don't want to do anything. 
I just wish I was dead. And this is every day, I feel like this. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate how I am. Why do I have to be trans and bi? 
Why couldn't Mum have just had a normal kid? 
I should be a girl, I should like pretty-pink, and dresses, and flowers and shit- but I don't. And I hate it. I shouldn't feel how I do towards girls- I shouldn't like them! It's wrong, and I'm so fucked up. 

I want to cut, but I am clean for 40days. I feel like shit. All I want is for some one to understand.
I can't speak to my Mum about *any* of this. 

Not my eating disorder, not self-harm, not about being queer, not about how I feel. She'll try get me help- I'm NOT dealing with CHAMS, or social workers, or anything like that, not again. 

I hate my self so much. Why couldn't I have just been normal? Why did Mum have to have a daughter like me? I SHOULD be her daughter, but I'm not, and I hate this! 

I hate when we argue, it's over stupid things, and I feel so bad after. I'm so horrible. It's not her fault, she has her brothers funeral to deal with, her having an autistic kid, with ADHD, who can't get ready in the mornings, and gets too confused, and everything feels too much- she shouldn't have to deal with that. 

I can't fucking wear anything other than hoodies, I have stupid fucking cuts all over my left arm, and all up my thighs. 

I stress over every little thing I eat, scared I'll get fat. Then I eat a shit ton of crap, and chuck it back up. What the fucking hell is wrong with me? 

Everything feels too much. I have school next week, that means sleeping at 3am, waking up at 5am, making myself exersise, go boil the kettle at 6, drink 3 coffees, and 2 green tea, and get dressed. ANNNNDD stress over every tiny little thing, and get distracted, as I do. Then get in the taxi at 7:20. Then school at 9, and school is not fun at all. I go to a SpEciAliSt school. (meaning all the other kids also have autism). There are only 7 kids in my class, I'm only friends with 1 of them. 40kids in the whole school, only 3 girls. I don't need extra education, or to be spoken to like a two year old, I don't need that, I need a mainstream school! 

Welllll. I got asked to veiw a mainstream, but, only 40% of the school spoke english, not being funny, but I am not willing to learn another language, and I wouldn't be able to make friends. And there is also a uniform...

I can't explain to my Mum that wearing a shirt (with a blazer-thingy), it makes me dysphoric because I can see my chest. (also- the sleeve might pull up, and I have cuts all up one of my arms, but it's nearly gone, I suppose :)
And all mainstream schools have uniform, so, I have to stay at this shitty school, where I'm not learning anything, have 1 friend, and it's a 1 hour and a half ride to school, 3 hours of my day is spent in a taxi! Fuck that. I'm not going back to school next week.

Also- with my eating disorder-thingy... Going back to school makes me eat A LOT less, and I'm more stressed. 

I don't even know how many calories is alot anymore. fuuuckkkkkkkk."
I hate my brain sometimes!,2,mloko5,0,"I literally saw a video of a person I used to have a crush on a few years ago, and now my Brian is just like ""time to fucking die"""
Part 1,1,mlok82,0,"Hi  
~~I hope it's ok for me to post using a throwaway account, I do so for reasons I hope I don't need to explain. In case something happens - there's a possibility I might end up responding or generally continuing the thread using a new account, the depression in my case dealt a lot of damage to my ability to remember things and I am very much expecting to forget the login info for this one.~~  


I come to you in a time where once again I seem to have hit emotional rock bottom, I don't think I'm expecting anything out of this, other than maybe venting in a text form and jutting everything - or what I can recall - down eases my mind a little, even if for like 5 minutes.  


I guess this is where I start, I have no idea how long this will get and I doubt I will have the patience to read through this to make sure it makes sense, or for any other reason, and my mind is something you could easily describe as broken, so if something ends up weird, inconsistent, or anything of the sort, I apologize greatly. I should also let you know, that while I think my English is not that awful, it is not my first language and on top of that, the ""plague that's ravaging my mind"" has actually made me a fair bit worse at it than I used to be. I hope the combination of mad ramblings and shitty English doesn't make it so that this is painful to read, or hard to understand. If it ends up that way, I apologize again and you have my blessing not to feel obligated to waste your energy trying to decipher it if it gives you a headache.  
There is a few things I can tell you for sure: all throughout my life I have tried and will continue trying to be the best person i can, to live by truth - conditions apply, for example while i do struggle with it, i sometimes allow myself a white lie if it helps with the other things in this sentence - to not make things harder for other people - on the contrary, try my best to make it easier for others, to not be a burden etc - to not be a hypocrite and to be humble. There's probably a few other things i should let you know about but i don't remember what else i wanted to mention so this will have to do. There is a reason why I said what i did, despite how full of shit it makes me sound, especially when I said i try to be humble, but trust me it wasn't easy to write down, mainly because of that. The reason I needed to mention some of those is that I want you to understand how i think - my moral compass, words i live by - and to add a layer of legitimacy to some of the claims that might follow. I want it to be clear that this isn't a joke, a troll post, a smearing campaign driven by an agenda, or an everyday hobby troll note from a compulsive liar. I hate lies - all my life i have been hurt, manipulated by them, I know firsthand the damage they can inflict and I understand them well. Since we are getting to know each other I might as well tell you the few things one could call me if they want it to hurt - something i understand you should never do on the internet. The words ""hypocrite"" and ""liar"" are the two words I am scared to be called in life. I probably forgot some, but these are the most important for what I'm trying to convey, which is: **please believe me**. If there are inconsistencies or signs of me lying in this post, if things don't add up - trust me it is not because I'm trying something funny, more likely just evidence of my head being doodoo.  


Well, I was supposed to start and look where we are, nice going me.  


I'm an 18 year old guy from the Czech Republic, born and raised a Catholic. From a personality test i had done at my school back in the day - a melancholic first, phlegmatic second (i believe the choleric was third and sanguine was last). I have been in an official battle against depression (and in my opinion PTSD, for reasons you might understand by the end of this) for two or three years now, and in a not-so-official battle with depression for like ten years, maybe twelve. As you can probably tell there is a bit of a dissonance between the official and non official versions - that means people only started believing me and stopped saying I'm a pussy bitch, i should get over it, or act like a man, when I ran out of fuel and physically stopped moving for days at a time two or three years ago, but the problem was going on for a long while before then. I myself didn't really let the thought it was depression get to me after hearing the aforementioned enough, because, from what I understand now, I was conditioned by my family and society into believing that I'm perfectly healthy - just a bitch. Granted, at this point I'm pretty sure i am a bitch as well, but that's besides the point.  


So, for the diagnosis period. When I slept through a few days and just didn't leave my bed at all, my parents, or to be more precise my mom, decided that hey, maybe that's not a very good sign and did some research, or ended up talking to a work colleague and I ended up being dragged to a psychologist next town over. We didn't really click and after losing a good fucking bunch of perfectly fine money I'm still salty about we moved on to a different psychologist who ended up being my current doctor and psychiatrist who I will call Sarah. Sarah diagnosed me with the expresso depresso - big surprise for everyone but me - motherly tears were shed and I was finally noticed, it felt like my parents really cared. I quickly found out Pepsi and Doritos made me feel a little better and my parents showed how much they cared by even going out of their way to provide them. Hell, even my cat seemed to understand what was going on because she slept with me a lot which helped too.  
It only gets worse after this, at least when it comes to parently (and feline) care - when it comes to my condition(s), this marks the beginning of a cog-shaped cycle of ups and downs - shortly after getting new meds I feel ok-ish, then I go on a decline, get new meds, start feeling better - steady decline. Rinse and repeat. Weirdly enough I miss this period of time. Nowadays my parents seem to, i don't know, they seem like they've forgotten about it all. I understand this is probably tiring for them, I am grateful for what they do and all - don't get me wrong, but I can repeat all that in my head, but it won't help with how things are, it wont help me cope with how they treat me now and it won't make it so I don't miss those days they really cared (or at least they showed it). Now it just feels like im a burden, like im just in the way. Sometimes they even complain to me, about me, when for example I come to one of them because I feel really down and i just need a hug. I have heard the equivalent of ""can you just stop being depressed"" three or four times now. Maybe I interpreted it wrong, but trust me i mauled it over a whole bunch of times and it holds up so far. By them I think i mean my mom, surprisingly - she always was the more loving/caring of the two, but I'm pretty sure I only heard it from her. Maybe its work getting to her. She has been stuck at the same job of a radiology technician at a local clinic for 30 years, I believe. Wouldn't be a problem if her dick boss didn't make all of the employees create one man companies so he can avoid taxes or something like that, and if they (all of them radiology technicians) didn't have to run the joint entirely by themselves, filling all of the positions, while obviously getting paid for one. I'm pretty sure there were 5 of them, then some left and recently the boss hired two young girls to do secretary work, but he hired them properly, with a contract. Best thing is my mom or her colleagues can't do shit about it, because by being forced to create those mini companies, they were forced to break the law and if they have, like my mother, used any company owner discounts for taxes or whatever else, which they most likely have, if they're getting paid as little as she is, then they're fraudsters by definition, whether by their own design or not. When it comes to my dad's work hes doing fine, he showed me a psych analysis paper he received once in an old job he quit a long time ago and i can see why he gets promotions very shortly after getting into a new job, hell i would give him a promotion if he showed that shit to me after coming to my job interview. The job im talking about paid very well and I sometimes wonder how many of our current troubles would've been avoided had he not quit, but it was very stressful apparently. This is all a quick summary to let you know why i feel a massive amount of pressure to do well in life. My dream is to have a stable life myself and to be able to provide my parents and loved ones with a life that is better than this, AFTER they retire. Its my dream and its my responsibility - meanwhile here I am, summarizing my life with tears in my eyes to a mob of strangers on the internet hoping i get a minute or two of peace and quiet from my own brain.  
So, Sarah - she runs a private clinic where she also referred me to a psychologist, who we will call Lisa. For about a year or maybe two, idk, I've been under Sarah and Lisa's care, with on and off results as stated before. Recently I started contemplating whether or not I should commit myself to a psych ward, but my mom quickly extinguished that idea, then Sarah did, by saying that should be the last resort. Sarah is actually the head of a daytime psych ward in a nearby town - or what i believed to be a nearby town only to find out it would take me hours and heaps of money to get there. The ""last resort"" status of a psych ward solution held up until a friend of my mom told her about her daughter's positive experience with one, so obviously a few days later I was sitting at an interview with a head of the reffered psych ward. It was supposed to be an interview to let me know if there's even any use for me at a hospital but i ended up locked up in a covid-test-result-awaitee room an hour later. That was the 5th of February and by the 29th if i remember both dates correctly, I was out and feeling surprisingly well. My objective there was to get out ASAP, not getting better, unfortunately, because I never handled being away from home well. I had no idea I could miss home and my family as much as I did. I was let out early on a condition - that I would attend the daytime psych ward, next building over. That is where I am at right now. I schedule visits with a psychologist and the head of the ward, once or twice a week and once a week respectively. I had a visit booked with both of them on Good Friday, which I called off because I was too tired to drag my ass there, and one today, which i called off because i was too tired to drag my ass there. Actually i spent the entirety of today in my bed on the verge of crying. Also, apparently even though i was told ""its ok to call off visits"", if i miss one more they'll have to let me go, because apparently ""they cant treat me if i don't show up"" - that's a great justification for literally telling someone not to come again, isn't it? I don't know if that's funny or painful. ""We can't help you if you don't come, so do us a favor and never show up again"". Anyways, I have the two visits tomorrow, and there's absolutely no pressure for me to come, clearly. The same way I felt the best I've felt for a long time shortly after leaving the psych ward, today i feel the worst i have felt since i can remember - for what that's worth. I'm pretty sure I feel as bad as I felt back in the day when i just said fuck it and stayed in bed for a week, but I wouldn't know, memory doodoo and all that.  


As for school, I go to a pretty sought after technical school (which is 4 years long - one year longer than regular high schools - or 5 years long for the kids two years younger than me, with 4 years being regular \[reformation\]) and my faculty is IT- it was hard but i had the backing of the best set of classmates I have had in my entire life, starting from kindergarten. It is honestly the only class i was assigned to, who didn't leave me with some sort of trauma - on the contrary - and again, including kindergarten. Notice how i said it *was* hard. I passed year one just fine, the running-out-of-fuel and catatonia problem took place around the second semester of year 2 but i passed alright, I had to write the classification test for one subject, other than that i managed to tie the ends together. I'm now in year 3 and it will stay that way. I have to stay the year because there is no physical way i could make up all the things i missed, so the only, singular good group of classmates and probably the best main teacher (?) i was ever assigned - I'm letting go of. How fun. Even better is the fact that - you've probably caught on by now - there is no guarantee I will be just magically healthy next year. I have arranged for individual teaching with the youth's education centre (or however you call that) my school works under, the papers are waiting for me to come back to school, but all of that was a year ago and I can only hope they didn't throw them out, because I never actually took them home.  


  
Well, it is now 1 am for me, the desperation wore off a little after a dinner and a shower and this post is already massive, while I have not even gotten into the ""good stuff"". I should probably scrap this, but I can't quite commit, as usual, so I gave it some thought and decided I'm not gonna post this on a complete throwaway, just make a new account, and split this story of mine into parts. I also realised that if I truly want to vent, I will end up giving away enough information about myself for someone from my past to recognize me, if for some reason they end up stumbling upon this newly established series. If you read this, think you recognize me and for some reason decide you want to laugh at me, expose my information, or share this post with some other mutuals to have a good laugh at my expense - act like a fucking grown-up and just ignore me.

I’m an asshole,4,mloccz,2,"I used to think I was a really genuinely good dude, but that was a complete delusion. These past few weeks have been really hard on me but I can’t say I don’t deserve it. About a year ago I just started dating a girl that I had been seeing for about a month so what do I do the day after we started officially dating, I cheat on her. And somehow by some miracle she stayed with me and so began by far the best, strongest and most loving relationship I’ve ever had in my life. 9 months later and I had somehow managed to not do anything too assholey, but obviously that wasn’t going to last. My mixture of commitment issues and general piece of shittery gave me the idea that I needed to end the best relationship of my life before I got in too deep. But obviously I didn’t stop there before I broke up I had to download tinder because what’s the point of waiting right it’s not like the only girl I’ve ever loved deserves enough respect for me to wait until after we’ve broken up to do that. Anyway here I am 5 months later finally facing the fact not only did I treated one of the kindest most loving people I’ve ever met like some expired meat. But that I deserve this. I deserve to feel like a piece of shit because that’s what I am."

Neigbour almost caught me smoking some weed and snitched,5,mlo56b,2,"So my neighbour who I thought I was cool with reported me to my mum, claiming he saw me smoke weed. We have been friends with this neighbour dude for like 2 months and we even chilled a couple of times. Though I never mentioned I smoked. He is a cigarette smoker himself and he smokes like a pack a day . I never judged him for his habit and would have never thought about mentioning it  to anybody. My mum told me he stopped her on the road and told her a bunch of crap about me and my habits. How I wear my hoodie all over my face while out(I do it because of social anxiety plus to hide some of my ugly scars on my neck which I am always judged for by complete randoms) , how i am always in the house ( minding my business ) , how my window is always open( supposedly told my mum that I open the windows to blow out smoke which is a complete lie as I smoke in the woods ) , how I always walk in a hurry ( which he claims I do because I have something to hide) ,how I always leave the house to chill at the back of my parents house , he even went ahead and told her about the casual conversation we had where I mentioned that I hardly drink (he instead told her that I am a drunk) . Good thing my mum doesnt believe him  at all. But its just nuts to think that this dude whom I thought we were becoming close would say such things to my mum to try and get me in trouble. I have never even had an argument with him or done anything to make him hate me. I smoke like a quater of a joint daily to relieve my depression , I have never caused any trouble for anyone  but someone goes out of their way to snitch. People suck man,

"My friends don't care about my depression and it hurts, I'm so lonely and miserable",2,mlo2oq,3,"I'm begging my friends for support, then they check on me for 2 days and then forget me again. I've never had a friend or boyfriend that truly cared about me and my interests. Wherever I go people tell me ""I don't want to play psychologist"" ""Why do you like that stuff it's kinda dumb""  and when I try not to be depressed and cheery they hate on my personality and interests. God it feels like it's me against a brick wall. I'm so tired of being born into a world of abuse, being different because of ADHD, being the weird kid in a very christian school. I'm so alone and nobody relates to me. Got very bullied in middle school too. They played games where the loser had to tell me they liked me because ""liking her is so embarrasing hahahahaha!"" 

I'm on the verge of dropping out of high school, fuck it, I'm gonna end up on the streets and I hate my life. School gives me panic attacks in class. Everyone thinks I'm messed up and weird. It's so, so embarrasing cause I feel like deep down I'm ""normal"" like everyone else, or at least like them. I've just experienced so much shit. I feel humiliated. I wanna be normal. I wanna be able to breathe without being judged or having to do amazing in school. I can't eat anymore, I can't sleep properly. I'm losing weight and my room is an incel's nest.

Depression Journal-Day #1,1,mlnzgn,0,"No need to read this post friend, only for those who are bored beyond measure :)  
I'm trying something new. This is my depression journal. I had some energy today and I felt like writing my progression. I'll write both positive and negative things that happen to me on that day. Maybe I get better maybe I won't. Also some of these things might be trivial to you  if you are reading it like just getting out of bed but it's not trivial to me  
Day 1:  
Got out of bed  
Brushed my teeth 2x  
Cleaned my room  
Didn't skip online class  
Paid attention to some parts of the lecture actually  
Studied a small amount.  
Exercised a very small amount.  
Ate proper healthy meals 3x  
Tried doing something new(drawing as long as I could as I normally don't do that)  
Felt bad not doing more, I don't know why I am not satisfied...fuck  


I'm still far behind in life but I tried and at the back of my mind I keep telling myself I should have done more, that it is not enough. Hopefully one day It will be enough. For now I will take baby steps."
Overwhelmed and Lost,4,mlnxzu,1,"Just need to get this off my chest.

I grew up in an extremely unstable household. Not very supportive, adults acted like kids, mental and physical abuse, manipulation, constant financial problems...the usual. Despite all the hardships, I would try my best to hold my head up high and have the mindset that these difficult situations would make me stronger. And as long as I worked hard and was a good person, things would eventually look up. 

I'm in my mid-twenties and recently some problems just occurred in my life. I just feel like I can't catch a break from life, that everything the could possibly go wrong ends up going wrong. I don't understand why bad things keep happening to me. I'm not asking to win the lottery, I just want to stop feeling this misery.

For the first time ever I feel like I'm suffocating. I was always able to hold my head above water but now I feel like I'm drowning. I feel like I'm finally breaking. I'm not a huge cryer but at work today I'm not sure what happened. I was just working and all of a sudden I started tearing up and had to step away. I felt so overwhelmed.

I can't sleep, eat, get out of bed, I can't think straight, I just want to crawl under a rock and stay there forever. I'm so tired."
I hate myself,3,mlntq5,0,"I have grown a hatred for myself in the past few months. I thought I was untouchable because my self-esteem was one of the few things that my depression had not yet taken from me in the 4 years I’ve been ill, but it took that from me, too.
I want to blame how I was born for the way I am but I do not know if I can. I do not know if it is my own failure or natural selection that will wipe me off this earth eventually but I know at the very least that something will.
Some things I can’t blame myself for, like my ADHD, my gender identity and my fucking disgusting dwarf height of 5’2. I hate how these things make me even weaker, I hate how I can’t do anything about them EVER and even if I someday will get over my depression I will always be weak because I was born weak.
I hate that my only talent is visual art which I know will never ever help me earn a living because I live in a small country where the people do not appreciate art and I would most likely never be able to even be good enough to stand out. It’s just a useless trait in me that can maybe earn me a few compliments but I would rather trade it for academic success so maybe I could one day pursue the career that I want to and live the life that I still have enough energy to dream for.
My father deserved a better son than I am. I love my father with all my heart but I am so scared that he will pass away before I can somehow show him how I admire him and can only dream to one day be the man that he is.

There’s so many more things in my mind but I am too tired to try and write them into words right now."

Long rant/venting (should I apply for disability?),2,mlnkvy,0,"Ive been bouncing between family members homes and Im tempted to just live out of my car. I just moved to Wisconsin into my dad's house because I thought him and my step mom would be more supportive.

I got and lost a job in just 4 days and I'm at a very low point. I've been researching psychiatrists and found an inpatient program, and I'm getting on my dad's insurance in the next 10 days. I just want to wait until I can make a psych appointment before I get another job and ruin that. Both my dad and step mom are down my throat about getting another job asap and to get out of my room. I lost my job just yesterday. A couple of minutes ago I was doing dishes and thinking about going for a walk when my step mom started yelling about how I have to get out of my room and go for a walk and if I kill myself then I'm going to hell (which I don't believe in). For some reason her telling me to do what I was already planning on doing just makes me want to stay in my room. 

I'm 19 and just lost my 10th job. No matter how hard I try I always end up having an anxiety attack and walking out. I don't know what to do anymore but I feel terrible living with family even if I'm paying rent and everyone just makes me feel more alone. My dad doesn't want me to even consider an inpatient program. I think it might be a good idea since I've been this depressed for a long time. I'm going on his insurance so I don't know if he has a say. I keep losing jobs so I definitely can't move out on my own.

I've looked up disability requirements and thinking about filing for low income housing. If I get a job I end up keeping it'll have to be minimum wage to qualify for low income housing, or I'll have to make $18 an hour (high income when I'm not qualified for anything) to be able to afford a cheap apartment and all my bills by myself. I also know it's a long process to apply for disability and even then I could be denied. I have ADHD, PTSD, severe major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks all diagnosed by my psychiatrist from my last state, but I'm not sure if I should attempt to get disability. Everything just seems like a lost cause."
Is it weird that it feels like the emotion stopping me from looking up suicide methods and stopping me from researching antidepressants are the same?,1,mlnjyy,0,It kinda feels like they are.
Spaced Out,2,mlnjg9,1,"I can't focus on anything even videogames or YouTube videos. I don't have hobbies, because I don't care about my mental or physical health. My memory is shit and I feel like an idiot when I can't remember something like my age. I'm on 5 meds and all they do is put a band aid on the wound; it doesn't bring me back to a time where I was ignorant of how cruel life can be. Sometimes I just sit and stare at the trees outside and remember all the shit that people have done to me. I want to either sleep or eat junk food or struggle to watch a funny YouTuber, but I end up sad or crying. I think about how life is meaningless and I've been dealt a bad hand. My therapist and doctor said I should consider disability. I'm tired and sad and it just makes normal people things harder."
Not sure what to say but here goes.,12,mlndt9,1,"I know so many of us are in pain and it just isn't fair is it?  I'm 53 and have suffered from OCD/Clinical Depression since I was about 15 or 16.

I have achieved none of the life goals of a ""regular"" person.  Significant other, decent job, house, car, love, any happiness. 

I got sick about 4 days ago.  Dizzy, nauseous, sinus, chest pains and I am all alone.  Being sick in bed alone has made me reflect even further on my life.  I know life isn't supposed to be fair, but a little joy would have been nice.

I've barely been out since the Covid kicked in last March.  Recently, I went to the dentist and had a look at myself in the mirror and was absolutely shocked.  I looked so haggard.  Like I had aged at least 5 yrs in 1.

For those of us who deal with Depression on a regular basis, we know it won't go away when Covid ends but I believe it has hit us harder.  Especially, those of us who are isolated.

Anyone else scared of going out in public even more now because you feel even worse about the way you look or feel?  I dread the summer.  The 14 hr days of sunlight.  I literally hate the daylight."
Never open up to anyone,18,mlndge,9,"I’ve learned today not to tell anybody how I truly feel. Even someone I thought I could trust. This person asked me what’s wrong after I had a sobbing breakdown today. At first I said I’m fine, just having a rough day. You know the usual deflection. They said that they’ve noticed I haven’t been taking care of myself lately as much as I should (for context I have stopped taking antidepressants). They said they could tell something is bothering me. So I thought they sound genuine in their concern, why not tell them that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and that even the slightest problem can push me past my breaking point (hence the breakdown earlier, triggered by something stupid). 

I don’t know what I expected, but all I got in response to opening up was a blank stare and now I’m being ignored. No support, no “hope things get better”. Fucking anything would be better than this. Right now I’m feeling so stupid for thinking anyone would understand. What’s the point anymore. I don’t trust anybody."
How to diagnose depression,2,mlnayl,1,"I haven't been able to concentrate on my work lately. And many a time I don't even feel like watching YouTube or scrolling through social media.
My sleeping cycle and appetite has become irregular and I feel sleepy almost the entire day.

It seems that I have all the symptoms for mild depression but I feel it could just be the lockdown blues or effects of addiction to social media and youtube 
How to diagnose for the cause? I don't feel like paying a buckload of money for therapy since I am not sure whether I need one in the first place"

"“OK, good luck”",3,mln3r7,1,"A rant on a throwaway account - thanks for hearing me out and getting this out of my head

&#x200B;

”OK, good luck.“ 

&#x200B;

I’ve suffered with major depression and active suicidal ideation for a long time. I’ve been on and off meds, been through ECT, and talked about hospitalization more than once. Every time I tell a provider that I’m not going to pursue care all I get is “ok, good luck.”   


I get it from the perspective of the provider. If your patient isn’t interested in treatment, forcing it isnt the right move. Also, for the sake of the health of the provider you can’t chase every patient.   


Just once it would be nice to have a provider say “no! You’re in too bad of shape and you need do something. Here are your options...”

Again, I get it. I just wish it was different.   


What have been your experiences with this been?"
Recovery is expensive...,3,mln21o,1,I know at this point the only way I'll get better is with extensive therapy and medication and honestly probably a long stint in a psych ward. But of course I don't have health insurance and can't afford it...which leaves me shit outta luck. It's hard to want to even try to get better when I feel like I'm staring down a tsunami with a tin buck in my hands. At this point I'd really rather just drown
Wanting to cancel my covid vaccine appointment,2,mlmzzd,4,"This is really stupid and would just have me continue to put other people at risk by being unvaccinated. I know that. I just need someone to slap that sense into me. 

I have my first dose of the COVID vaccine scheduled for Thursday morning and I want to cancel it because
 a) it sounds exhausting and stressful to get up and go
b) I'm a horrible person who doesn't deserve to be vaccinated. Other people deserve it much more and I don't want to waste a much-needed vaccine"
Mom is dying of brain cancer and I have no hope for a better life,66,mlmqnm,8,"I worked very hard for a long time. In 2017, I decided to stay sober and focus on being responsible, volunteering, improving myself. Nine months later some teenager hit me with his car (no trial, no jail time), shattered 13 of my bones, and ruined the sensation in my right hand. A year and about 100 PT sessions later, my mom was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, which has now become a glioblastoma; she’s immobile and can barely speak. This diagnosis came less than six months after she retired. 

Over the past four years, my dog died; my ex — only person I’ve ever loved — married someone far more handsome and richer than me; I lost my job as Covid hit, despite making so many sacrifices; and now I’m living at home, over 30, my mother’s caretaker. I think I’m also becoming an alcoholic. 

I don’t want to travel. I don’t want to fall in love. I don’t want a pet. I don’t want a good job. I don’t want a nice apartment. I don’t want to meet new people. I just want this all to end."
He blocked me,1,mlmpkn,6,The guy I liked blocked me because I called him out for being on dating apps and using those apps while we were hanging out. Every time I express my feelings he blocks me and I have to make 5+ fake accounts just to bother him so he can respond but this time I know it’s done. He really broke my heart 💔😕 I think I was in love with him
Wits end,2,mlmktr,2,"In hospital have been for a week with serious physical health. 

Messaged partner saying I’m having a bad time, sobbing, really feeling not ok head wise.

I'm 22 years old and I'm mainly depressed because I've never had a girlfriend,36,mlmc73,8,"My mum always told me my depression is most likely reactive and to an extent I do agree with her.

I can enjoy blissful moments in life especially while I was a lot younger. However when you are younger it is so much easier to be innocently ignorant to the way society works.

I understand having or experiencing a relationship doesn't fulfil everything in life or provide happiness, just like money doesn't provide happiness, or big homes provide happiness. Being rich doesn't provide happiness but one needs money in order to survive. I also understand that some people would rather be better off without one. But that's easy to say if you hop from relationship to relationship like hopping on a plane or take your experiences for granted because of your looks or social skills that a lot of men and women would kill for.

This is sort of how I feel about my relationships. They are almost always platonic or acquaintances partially because I choose them to be that way. I have been so isolated for so many years that I think it is destroying me layer by layer until it finally reaches areas of my soul that won't be able to take the further destruction. This is down to my childhood and being blamed for the way I was born and thus inevitably being bullied, rejected and outcasted most of my life. Including now however it is just a lot more discreet and how it is shown.

I'm not saying for a second this is all down to not having a girlfriend. It definitely isn't. But it is definitely a large chunk of it and I'll explain why.

One of the main reasons I was bullied in school for many many years was because I had never had sex. I think at least half of my friends lied, but it was much easier for them to lie than it was for me; because genetically there was so much wrong with me it was impossible to lie and keep up the pretend. Not only did the bullying of the situation become the icing on the cake; but the romantic fantasies I would concoct made it a desire impossible to bare at times being from ages 8-16 having never experienced a single thing. Most of my classmates have now either had children or had ten plus relationships at my age now being 22. This is why I always feel like there's something wrong with me.

I do believe some of these experiences are distractions from inner problems; and I'm not denying this is true. However what I am denying is that 'relationships don't matter' because they do. Being able to obtain a relationship, matters, having connections, matters, even if you prefer to live the more lonesome life like I clearly do.

I just wish there were girls I could meet where I would not instantly feel a pent up rage inside of me assuming they are going to instantaneously judge me on how I look despite how hard I worked for 5 years to make changes to my face, body. It never changed my genetical features which ultimately has made all of it feel like a waste of time because women have rarely felt any sexual attraction towards me; and if they did, it was to use me for their own gratification or an ego boost, or because they wanted something from me.

Most consider me average looking but I know the aura around me I sense people truly believe I am below average to quite ugly. The blanket stares I get from people can be quite hard to deal with and sometimes this can happen even in my own closest family and friends and can be really tough to bear.

I just wish society focused less on looks and more about the kind of person someone is. I understand it's becoming more this way now especially since so many people become abused in relationships due to focusing on the wrong factors; however do not less this stray from the clear fact that most people get dismissed if they do not find them even slightly sexually attractive.

And this is ultimately why I am so depressed everyday. The more days I wake up the more I feel so lonely and my heart sink lower and lower feeling like I am falling into a pit which I can never crawl back up from. It gets harder and harder to pick myself back up and feel like I can grasp the steering wheel and get my confidence and self worth back up.

I honestly wish myself and everyone good luck for the future in their endeavours and I am very aware there is more to life than this but my one true desire in life is just to be able to experience the ability to obtain a relationship."
I’m tired. Life is so hard.,1,mlm6sk,0,"I don’t have the energy to write, but i’m just tired of my life, i’ve been repeating for yeaaars that tomorrow will be better, but it never happened."
I have hyper-realistic morbid dreams every night and they completely detach me from reality.,2,mlm6b1,1,"I already have a bad enough problem with disassociation and detachment from reality, but the last four nights in a row have made it so much worse.

I don’t know how my brain even creates these horrible nightmares, with family members dying over and over again, and some with my friends telling me they hate me. I don’t feel like I know what is real anymore.

Waking up and getting out of bed is difficult enough, but waking up from these dreams makes life so much harder.

I don’t even want to live in real life, now my dreams are just another place I suffer."
I am to the point of just ending my life. I have no hope and no reason to keep going.,2,mllylc,4,"I have no hope left. I am 40 yrs old 500 lbs and on disability unable to work. I got a hell of a list of mental issues and I get 800 a month off disability. 400 of it going to bills. no extra income. no family, all are dead or I have nothing to do with the ones that are alive. I have not one friend, and not just saying oh I have no friends, but yet talk to about 3 people per week etc.

I literally have no one. it has been 4 years since I have voice chatted with anyone outside the room mates I live with. it has been over 12 years since I have actually watched movies etc with anyone. I am very high risk for covid, if I catch it, I will not survive it. I will literally die from it. my town doesn't have the vaccination and the nearest town is 30 miles away no way to get there.

all my town has is 20 plus fast food chains. a walmart and a brookshires. tons of dr's and a few churches. I am far from religious and been banned from all the churches for questioning the pastors/preachers and for calling them out on their bs for not doing what they preach but demanded others do what they preach. all my hobbies require money. and I need a vehicle to even do all of my hobbies. only hobbies that don't is gaming and watching movies and tv shows. since I torrent everything. but still, it absolutely sucks.

I owe the housing authority for low income housing 9 thousand dollars, and its not my fault but yet I owe them 9k. I have no car, bought one a few years ago and got scammed out of 3k. I have a crown that is broken and need to get fixed but can't afford the 1200 to fix it nor can I afford the 400 to have it pulled. it is also my only molar that I have left on my left side, if it gets pulled I won't be able to chew any hard foods. the nearest dental college is 30 miles away and again no way to get there and with this covid, I wouldn't trust going until I got my shots.

I been single my entire life, never had a real girlfriend. only about 6 women who pretended to want me and love me then faked their death on me or stalked me for over 5 years. never lasted more than a month with either of them. I have no children. always wanted kids in my early 20's never happened. now I am 40 and just don't want kids of my own anymore.

Spent the past 10 years trying to date and find someone to settle down with and the past 10 years, I have been laughed at, mocked at, made fun of, told to kill myself, told I don't deserve love. had a woman I met on reddit tell me I was a complete piece of shit because she read my post of how I survived 10 yrs being homeless and said anyone who steals is a piece of shit and needs to go to prison. didn't matter why they stole. yet she had 4 kids by 4 diff men no income and living with her parents and judged me for stealing food/socks to survive.

I have lived a hard life and because of it, I have cptsd and severe chronic depression along with paranoia and other issues. making it very hard at times to get over my past and I have cptsd nightmares sometimes of things I been through. meds help sometimes but not all the time. therapy does nothing. tried grounding and other things.

I just got out of 2k debt with 4 credit cards thanks to the stimulus check. I put that 1400 plus the other 600 I had saved towards all 4 credit cards. that 600, took me 4 months to save. I just have no hope left anymore. last time I been hugged, was back in 2012, before that, it was 2007, before that it was 1996. last time anyone told me they loved me and actually meant it, was back in 1996. last woman I been with or tried to be with was back in 2016. before that it was 2012, before that it was 2007. and a couple others between 2007 and 2016 but it was nothing but bs and me basically being catfished.

I just don't have it in me anymore to keep living life. I have no more reason to keep going.

I have done many many things in my life all cash under the table, some were actual paid jobs but didn't last but a few months or a couple weeks before I had to quit.

I have worked on Farms/Ranches and have done many things. I have done things from cleaning horse stalls, pig pens, shoveling manure and laying down fresh hay to washing and brushing horses. I have also done lots of land construction. Building pathways, concrete or cement slabs to build sheds on, all types of fencing even having to move fencing. digging trenches to lay down piping or wires. My day to day jobs varied on what the bosses wanted done on the Ranch/Farm.

I did boxing for six months but was forced to quit due to health issues.

I have taken jobs putting up walls, sheet rock, putting in floors of tile, carpet, laminate, even putting in outlets. I have done home repairs from plumbing, holes in the walls to rotten floors or counters. I have even built tons of different driveways built out of all types of things. Dirt, Rocks, Pavement, Cement, Concrete, Asphalt. I have even built several porches or decks for peoples houses and wheelchair ramps for their homes. I even got into painting ceilings and walls for peoples homes indoors and even installing light fixtures and ceiling fans.

I have owned a landscape company called Big. E. Landscape, which consisted of mowing, edging, trimming, planting trees, plants, bushes, trimming bushes and shrubs.

I went to California and got my Class A - CDL to drive eighteen wheelers and had a job for a bit doing that for almost 5 months but was forced to quit because of my anxiety attacks from driving them. My job was to operate the truck, hook and unhook the trailer, make sure the trailer was safe for transport and was loaded properly and strapped down properly and to plan out the route via a map and make sure I had the route down and all of the fuel stops and rest stops down along the route.

I worked in the rodeo scene preparing horses and bulls for the show and then putting them back in the pins after the show and giving the horses a bath and brushing them after the show.

I worked with this local heavy metal band. Which consisted of setting up their guitar, bass, drums and mic's during shows and tuning them. Then I had to break everything down after the show and put it up.

I got into Archery and even got into fletching arrows and selling the arrows I made. which turned into a small local business of my own.

I owned a small auto business doing tune ups mostly consisting of changing their oil, radiator fluid, spark plugs, belts, alternators, radiators, fans, batteries, tires. bulbs. fuses.

I used to fix computers and do computer repair from home and fixing cars doing tune ups like oil changes flat tire fixes belt changes light bulb changes spark plug changes brake changes alternator changes radiator exchange changing batteries simple minor things like that and ran the business myself and getting customers via online websites or word of mouth.

and here I am, 40 yrs old, no friends, no family. mental issues out the ass, in a small dead end town. no way to get anywhere. no where to go. trapped. every time I tried to leave this town things came up, either needed eye surgery, or had to use what money I saved. I can't do it anymore. regardless how much I try it always blows up in my face or I end up failing and making things worse for myself. I am at this point, just waiting to die."

As if my life couldn't get any worse (Long),2,mllnd2,2,"49 year old guy. Never been in a relationship with a man nor women. Hooked up with anonymous guys when I was in my 30's but that wore off within a few years. Other than that the only person I had ever messed around with in that way was a friend from childhood, John, who I met at age 10. This went on from about 16 until my late 20's.  Unfortunately he apparently saw it as more than simply friends with benefits which is why I had to stop engaging in that with him as it ****ruined our friendship. There is an entire story there but I will leave that for another time. Anyway I am still 'friends' with him although its sort of more out of routine than wanting to actually associate with him. He just stresses me out all the time including lying alot.  However I do think in some twisted way even 20 years later he see's our friendship as more than what it is and was even though I put out the total opposite vibe.

I have never told anyone in my family or social circles about any sexual or romantic or there-lack of aspects of my life as it applies to John or in general. All they know is that John is a friend since childhood.

I have almost no social circle aside from a couple of other normal friends. One of them I talk to about once every couple of months and the other maybe once a week and occasionally go out to eat. Used to hang out with them alot during the late 90's and early 2000's.

My family circle consists of my mother, my brother who I am not close with but talk to and see occasionally and his wife who I will call Laura and who I only tolerate as she is a busybody knowitall who is also into all sorts of conspiracy shit and loves ramming her opinions and views down other peoples throats.

Anyway, apparently my friend John has been messaging Laura on Facebook in recent months even though they were never actually friends in real life. Not sure who started messaging who or why although in a recent text conversation I had with John he said she has been bothering him about cannabis. She is also into pot and CBD and thinks its a cure all for everything and likes to talk about it.I told John to just tell her he is not interested in discussing it and stop bothering him with it. So at that point I assumed that was that.

Well today suddenly Laura messaged my mother on Facebook and asked what is going on between me and John. Of course my mother had no idea what she meant. Laura went on to say that John seemed to be saying stuff that led her to think he was was obsessed with me and said that can be interpreted as, to use the word she used, ""mushy"".

Now John is a weird guy in general and is not the brightest bulb in the lamp but I can't imagine what he said that she thought was ""mushy"" but I am royally pissed off at him and for that matter her about the whole thing. I don't need more crap in my life. I have enough stress. Anyway John apparently talked to her about more than just pot. Honestly Laura probably dug at him to find out more about me and he was not smart enough to watch what he said. Again as I said she is a busybody. Now I do not think he actually went into detail but I suspect it was more about his tone when referring to me, enough so that it raised a flag for her.

I plan to get in touch with John tonight to find out what the hell is going on and I also am going to end the friendship. He already stresses me out and now THIS. He really screwed me over. I want nothing to do with him anymore. But he has forever left this new dark cloud over my head by not being able to keep personal shit about me and him to himself, especially when talking to people who are also part of my social or family circle."
Sad,1,mlll94,0,I feel like my life is at its end and idk why. I feel exhausted and sad because it feels like I’m almost at the finish line. I’m not suicidal and honestly im scared that I will randomly die. I just don’t feel like I’m gonna be here for a long time for some reason.
Can't get out of my car and go into work.,2,mlll7b,2,"Sitting in the car in the carpark outside work.

Feel like there is a 300 kilo person sitting on my chest and I want to puke up my breakfast.


I literally feel stuck here. 


It's like I can't breathe."
I wish I had died that night,2,mllklw,0,"6 years ago I had an illness I wasn't aware I had. I don't want to get into the illness right now, but I had really bad vertigo-like symptoms and I had been throwing up every day for about two weeks.

Even though I live in a courty with free healthcare, I've always had a mentality that the hospital should be the last resort. I can tough it out until I get better. I was convinced it was just a flu. Finally enough people close to me convinced me to go.

As soon as I get to the ER, I told the lady at reception my symptoms and before I know it I'm being rushed to a bed and I have IV's sticking out of me, a heart monitor attached and nurses taking blood samples at a very alarming rate. In all my years I've never been whisked away in the ER like that. I always have to wait like 4 hours to see anybody.

I finally talk to a doctor after a few hours of laying there, and he tells me if I had waited even one more day to go to the hospital, I would have died. Those words have haunted me every day since.

I forget how long I was in the hospital in total, about a week I think. It was really tough mentally. I cried every single night, and had more thoughts of suicide than I ever had in my life combined.

My then girlfriend would come see me every day after work, and she wouldn't leave until they kicked all the visitors out for the night. We were so in love then.. She would hold me in my bed and tell me everything was going to be okay. When I started to regain my strength we would hold hands and go for walks around the hospital together. I sincerely believe the reason I survived was because I had her.

Fast forward to today, and I'm medically okay. I've recovered fully, and am syptom free, but my life has done nothing but go downhill since then.

My girlfriend and I were together over a decade before she left me for another man. I have no friends anymore, just a couple of pen pals, I have no family. I owned the business of my dreams, and now I'm unemployed going on a year.

If I had died then, I would have died happy, in love, surrounded by people who cared a out me, and with so much potential

I survived, but for what?"
Thearapy,1,mlljnv,1,I dont want to sound like a douche but i really dont understand thearapy. Ive tried it but its just a random person that could never understand how someone else feels.

Lost,2,mllic6,1,I have literally no interest in anything whatsoever. I cry sometimes maybe once a week but not suicidal as such and not really sad just so numb that nothing interests me at all.

What is the fucking point....,1,mllgyl,3,"Christmas in 2020 was shit. me and my brother went to my dads after he phone us telling us that he had something to tell us. We went up thinking that his cancer might be back again which he got in 2018. But after we got in the house and sat down it was really clear that wasn’t it. He told us that he was arrested for indecent photos of children.... at first I wanted to beat the shit out of him. I was built up with soo much rage and anger but I am not normally a angry person. He then told us that tried to kill him self three times in the space of two weeks and telling us that he was sorry and shit. Me and my dad haven’t ever really had the best relationship and he didn’t have any clue about me ever. That night I went home told my mum what happened then went to bed and all these scenarios went through my head. What happens when his name gets put out on newspaper or something and I have to change my first name and second name. Which leads to me then having to tell my friends and other people who might know ask me why i change it and stuff. And then they might think that I might be like him or something. Once I did discussion thing in school and it was about Paedophiles and crime n shit why I think they should get the death penalty for doing the crime. Then I thought would I want my own dad to get it and now I am in this situation...... few other things played through my head that night. Didn’t get any sleep as well. Ever since then I felt like shit and everybody that I know or has ever seen me has been talking about me behind my back and saying shit about me or my family. My friends in last couple of months have been distance away from me and every now and then I see photos of them out and shit and never get invited or anything and now I am thinking some of that stuff I was thinking on that very same night just might be true. And now stuck in this situation we’re my friends might not like me evermore and everyone in town knows what my dad is and what they think about me.... it’s crazy to think that something that was completely out my hands or any sort of control has ruined my life and now stuck in this depression day in and day out and been hiding it. Been trying to find myself a apprenticeship for like nearly month now and starting to think I might turn into him. And now I don’t know what to do and starting to go deeper and deeper into a hole everyday. Anyways I hope  everyone has better life than me. love you all👍

Sorry If I wasn’t aloud to swear and stuff it’s kinda bad habit and also sorry for my spelling and stuff."
I miss my bruises,4,mllgu2,0,"I used to be in a sport in which getting bruises, and sometimes injuries, were common. When I was first starting out, I’d get a lot of bruises. My wrist would be covered with bruises. I’d come home from 5 hour afterschool practices exhausted, worn out, and starving. I’d get bruises on my wrists, my legs, knees, sometimes even my nose. Once, I got a small bruise on my lip and eye. I’m no longer in that sport, and I miss it. I miss feeling like crap after practices; I miss unknowingly going hours without eating and coming home with a new bruise that would last a week. Those bruises at least kept me interested. It would look different with every passing day; maybe I’d wake up and it’d be darker or lighter, or maybe the color would become more purple. I don’t get bruises as easily anymore and I miss it. I don’t even know why I was so infatuated with having and getting bruises, but I miss them. It’s so stupid."
Why do I try,2,mlleh8,0,"Why do I try anymore, I will always be a loser. I have not a single skill, not a single strong suit, and not a single thing I am halfway competent at. I am such a fucking worthless waste of space, such a pathetic piece of shit who will never amount to anything. Why am I even alive right now, all I am doing is wasting food and air that would be better used to on wild animals than me. 

No one will miss me when I am gone, no family, none of my nonexistent friends, nobody. I honestly don't get why I have no killed myself when I live everyday in pain with no hope of getting better. I can't keep living, it is hell to live everyday with constant anxiety and self hatred, I fucking despise myself. It gets so bad my chest tightens so much it can hurt. 

I wish I could just press a button and die or be able to just euthanize myself. Since that sadly isn't an option I guess I will have to wait until I stop being a fucking baby and just end it. My body would probably rot for weeks before anyone notices, its funny and sad to think about that."
I always try not to show who I really am because I am a piece of shit,2,mlldqq,2,"I am seriously SO toxic, needy and abusive, I hate myself and who I really am, but I always try my best not to show it to people and treat them as nice as possible everytime. 

I won't even try to have kids, they don't deserve a parent like me, nobody does. I don't want to be lonely but I don't deserve anyone, and I don't want to hurt anyone.

I don't know what I would do if I fall in love with someone. It will surely hurt but I don't think I can be with anyone. I am immature.

I hate being so isolated but it's the best thing for everyone, I think.

I'm sorry for this rant."
Doing work while dealing with depression,1,mlldi8,0,"So I’m not really sure what to say but I have a question and I’ll give some background that might help. 

How do you deal with depression and getting school work done? 

I’m in college living away from home, and I’ve had an unconventional route through college due to health complications. I am currently seeing a therapist and taking medication but I wanted advice from other people who deal with depression. 

Depression is something I’ve struggled with for a while and usually I go through periods where it’s difficult for me to get work done, but it usually passes and I’m able to catch back up. 

But this past semester my depression has been pretty bad. As I’ve said I’m working through issues that contribute to this and am actively trying to get better. But my school work has been severely impacted and I am behind. I am still getting some of my work done but often I find it really difficult to do anything productive and instead do things that distract my mind - tv and video games. 

I was just wondering if anyone had advice on how to get myself to do work or motivate myself during this period?"
"My life sucks, and lockdown made it worse",1,mlldeu,0,"I have developed major insecurities and depressive, suicidal thoughts over the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. I had a lot of time in my hands, and most of it were spent thinking about my situation where I had slapped myself with harsh realizations. I have regarded myself as poor and somewhat handicapped due to my situation. To get in straight to the point, I feel insecure and jealous of the people around me living in subdivisions. Literally every single one of the  people I know lives in one, while I live in the middle of the city. They live their lives with fresh air in the mornings and cold breeze at the night, while 24/7 I go out and all my nose gets is polluted air and dust. They live with peaceful bird chirping sounds while there's not 10 seconds of silence in here due to the endless traffic noises and annoying honkings. 

I love playing sports (basketball and badminton) and I have become a varsity player at school beginning at my sophomore year. I realized that I only get to practice when I get my ass off to an arena which will take a couple of minutes (and travel, entrance fees, gets expensive overtime) to get into, while my friends just casually go out their houses and play in basketball and badminton courts in their village. The insecurity in me is that I could've become this, could've become that.. if only I had the means to do it. Yes, no excuses quotes exists, but damn it's painful to see everyone excel at a very rapid rate than me. I also like to record songs but traffic noises piss me everytime and throws my mood away.. while my friends just flex on me their peaceful sounding subdivisions and record their music with minimal takes.

What made everything worse is that, the lockdown literally gated me from doing EVERYTHING... while them... they CAN STILL do the usuals. Damn, it pains me when I see their stories about playing basketball, taking walks in their village, practicing driving, morning jogs, leisure activities, cycling, while all I feel is that I'm rotting inside my house. All I have is my computer, and all I do all day is play a bunch of games. I resorted into gaming getting my dopamine to somewhat ease the pain, but everytime before I sleep everything just hits me again. It sucks that I try to be happy everytime my friends and my girlfriend say something about their activities in their subdivision, deep inside I feel so jealous and insecure... 

I do not envy anyone though. In fact, it is good that they have such privileges. It is one's fault that this is my situation. It is just undeniable that I feel like trash and depressed every single day. I wish I could take fresh air in.. wish I can walk at mornings, afternoons, evenings.. wish I can go out of my house without wearing masks. I feel like I am wasting my teenage years where I have the most potential.. inside my house in total isolation with nothing to do but online classes and gaming. It just sucks that my relationships are being affected too (I have been a lot irritable and my family thinks I hate them. I have also lost so much emotional and mental strength, affecting my relationship with my girlfriend), since I am losing motivation to be better at anything... I stopped my workout, my regular practice of coding... chores and hygiene.. I feel like everything is so unfair for me and there's no more reason to continue.

I wish I lived in a subdivision. If only my family was rich enough (my sibling also feels the same way as me, although we haven't talked about it, but I hear her having emotional breakdowns about this certain matter), but that's another conversation, and a whole another insecurity as well."
how do i tell my parent(s) im depressed and suicidal?,2,mllau9,1,"Im turning 19 and i hopefully will be graduating in a few months from high school. I say hopefully because ive really been low functioning since covid happened and my parents are only getting angrier and more disappointed with me now that Im becoming the opposite of what I used to be. 

I just wanted to ask how you know if it's the right time to tell them? Im really itching to tell them right now cause we just had a big fight but they probably wont listen to me because of this. 

Should I tell them about my cutting and suicidal plans/ideation? 

How do I approach them?

Im usually bad with words but my mom probably wont let me give her a page with my writing on it since i already tried doing that when i wanted to quit the IB program (it's like AP in the US and A-levels in the UK).

We're low income and have language barriers as Asian immigrants living in Europe so we probably cant afford professional help. I regret not asking my school counselor before spring break on how i should tell my parents so im asking you guys : ) thank you if your read through this. To understand my full context, you can read more from my past post."
"I want to start digging myself out, advice?",2,mll9lk,1,"I'm tired of being depressed, I'm tired of letting it win, keeping me in bed all day, destroying my energy. What do you do when you find yourself spiralling or in the midst of a bad bout of depression? How do you take steps to start pulling yourself out of a rut? I need some inspiration or advice."
Do you personify your depression? Have you given it a name?,1,mll9i8,1,"In Dexter, he calls his murderous impulse his dark passenger.  I hope none of y'all have a real ""dark passenger,"" but have you named your depression?   Am I the only one who speaks to it? 

 I generally just say, ""Fuck you, brain!"" ;-)"
A waste,3,mll7x9,0,"I've felt like a waste of air for a long time now,  and it feels like the more I've tried to get out of this vicious cycle the worse i ended up.
Been fighting with depression,  Anxiety,  Suicidal Thoughts and Self harm urges for a few good years but in all honesty I am tired.  I feel like everyday comes and goes but there is no real reason, goal or ambitions behind it. 
I feel like I am a shall of what I once was and I can't even find something to be happy about, the girl I love seems to not really care about me, or us as in a relationship. It feels like no matter how much effort and time I try to put into something it will inevitably fail,  like it did so many times before. I can hardly see a point to it anymore but I keep pushing,  I am telling myself that everything is okay when I can't help but feel the opposite thing every single night. I am  a hypocrite,  I am telling others how to try and achieve hapiness while I know fully that is never that simple.. at times I wished I was dead, other times I am happy to be alive. But it feels like the bad outweigh the good, and it's not even close"

But i dont know if i would manage to study and work in a foreign country since i am already a low functioning depressed and autistic "
That Feeling of Isolation,2,mll64m,1,"Does anyone ever get that feeling of isolation? When you try to be open about your struggle with Mental Health -- especially with those closest to you -- but you feel a bit of backlash that all you do is identify with depression and that you are just burdening people around you with your negative energy. I mean I try the best I can to put my outlet in other things to try to let out the steam and not on my relationships, but shit, sometimes you just want to talk to another human being. But then you're only faced with shame feeling like you overshared and all you should do is bottle everything up inside again -- the very same habit that brought you here in the first place. This sucks."
I think I’ve finally been broken,1,mll5rt,0,"After struggling with sad and really dark thoughts for almost 2years I’ve finally gotten to my breaking point. Usually I’d cry, be sad, think about bad stuff but for the past two days I’ve been just numb. I don’t feel anything anymore. I don’t feel hate, sadness or joy. I just exist. After getting in a big emotional fight I’ve lost. That’s it. I don’t feel anything..congrats life, you’ve broken me to the point i just see black and nothing else."
Something broke inside,0,mll1k9,0,"Something broke inside  
It's never gonna be alright  

All my dreams and ambitions   
Seem so far away  
Out of my reach  
Out of my grasp   
Maybe they were made for someone else  
Someone whos not there anymore  
Someone who died a long time ago  
Now an imposter lives in its place  
A shadow of who was to be  
Unfit for the calling of life  
Unfit for the simplest tasks

You'll just wither away  
You'll just writhe in insignificance  
Your wants will haunt you everyday  
And you'll turn from them

Unstructured post about the fact that I haven’t done anything with my life,2,mlkwy0,0,"I’m about to go to college only to make my parents happy and they don’t want to acknowledge that i’ve possibly been struggling with depression for a while now, only for it to have gotten significantly worse in the past year and a half. There’s no career or major i care about so much that i’d want to do it for the rest of my life. My teenage years have been a complete waste and the most significant thing in these years has been getting my period at the beginning of 6th grade. I’ve never been in a relationship nor has anyone liked me for more than a week (seems like anyone i talk to ends up finding me annoying), though all of my friends are in relationships, have been in one, or just don’t want one. I doubt I’ll manage to ever find someone who’d want to be with me since I’m emotionally unstable and have no plans for the future. I suck and I’m tired of everything."
"Based on personal experience, which factors caused your depression?",1,mlkvg1,1,"Maybe genetics, maybe childhood trauma, maybe losing a loved one, maybe feel of meaningless. If we share, maybe we can understand our situation better."
hurting myself makes me feel normal.,5,mlku0d,0,i drank yesterday so i had a headache and cut up my thigh so lieing down and moving hurt. it feels good to be physically in pain. i like feeling as sore as i am mentally. my body makes sense then. i like being forced to look after myself all day. it makes all the other problems pointless.
Functioning depression,1,mlksyc,1,"I’ve been doing a little reading about functioning depression.   The idea you can have depression but to the outside world it appears that your fine.   The experts seem to disagree that this is a real thing however I think it is part of a solution for me.   I’ve realized lately that if I keep it inside practicing mindfulness of my behavior and just not really express what I’m feeling or tell the truth when people ask me questions, the world around me is happier and they leave me alone.   The trick seems to be never to break ranks.   I made a slip up last night when I was telling my wife why I didn’t want to go out with some friends that invited us.  I should have just made up something like early meeting or tired or whatever.    If I can keep from doing that, life should be better for those around me.   It’s hell for me but what does that really matter."
I don't know what to do.,1,mlksre,0,I'm lost. I can't even get out of the house. It's just so hard to get up. I'm a mess. A fucking disaster. I just disappoint everyone. It's just so hard to keep go forward.
Why do people always tell me do this or do that,1,mlkrho,0,"Basically after being depressed for years I told my parents and its made everything worse they treat it like it's one thing bothering me that I can just fix and also found out I was born with extreme anxiety, neurotic and pessimistic behavior, and I'm a perfectionist so literally nothing makes me happy and now I'm failing in school and all can think about is suicide fucking yay."
How did you open up to your parents about your mental issues?,3,mlkqno,2,"Everyday it's getting harder to get out of bed, dress up, shower, smile, etc. I don't feel anything other than pain and anger anymore, I don't remember the last time I was really happy or excited about something. I constantly feel in pain and stress, I swear a lot and get angry out of no where, I start crying even to the smallest things.

I have really serious suicidal thoughts, I even planned how I would do it and had dreamed about it several times but I'm trying to stop myself everytime by thinking about my family and friends. 

I have really supportive family and friends but I don't want to upset them by opening up, I once tried to tell them that I was not okay but they thought it was some teenager stuff and I couldn't tell them how serious it was and I had been sufferring for the last 4 years of my life. 

I don't know if I'm depressed or have any other mental issues, I've never seen a physiciatrist (I hope it's the right word, English is not my main language) in my life but I know that I'm in pain and I need help, I just don't know how to talk to them.

I don't know how to tell my family that their daughter they do everything for wants to kill herself, is in constant pain and falls asleep crying every night. I'm scared that they won't take me seriously even though they are normally really supportive parents, I'm scared to upset them, I'm scared to disappoint them but at the same time I don't want to die but this urge inside me is getting much more powerful everyday.

So please tell me, how did you open up to your family about your mental issues, how did you tell them that you were suicidal and how did they respond?"
Does an antidepressant without diarrhea or tinnitus exist as side effects exists?,1,mlkqkx,1,"I stopped taking zoloft a few months ago (after being on it for five years), and it made my life worse than ever before, but I couldn’t stand the diarrhea. I am now in contact with a doctor again, hoping to get some therapy, but I know I need some kind of medication and I would like to have something on my feet before I go to the doctor and he just tries to throw random medication on me.

I have heard good things about buprorion but I am scared of the tinnitus side effect. I already have mild tinnitus and I don’t think I can stand it getting worse. After being on zoloft and having stomach issues, resulting in an almost fear of going to the toilet, I can’t stand that either.

I know it can be different from person to person, but generally speaking, what could be a medication that meets these criterias?"

Getting over ex,1,mlkoo5,6,"Hey guys.  I'm feeling discouraged.  I want to be closer to my ex, but she doesn't reply when I try.  How do you keep faith in a better future, if you have serious doubt?  I actually feel hopeless sometimes."
"Warning, long read.",1,mlkn6s,1,"It doesn't matter what the fuck I do, I will never find long-term satisfaction with my life or myself. Everything I do to change things is just a temporary band-aid that helps me feel better for a little while and then I just go back to my default mood of hopelessly depressed. I've been so dissatisfied with my life and myself for so long now that I think I've forgotten what it feels like to be somewhat ok with things. 

Being unemployed in a town that I never really adjusted to moving to was a major source of my depression for quite a while, so I thought finally finding a job and moving back to my hometown would finally help me to feel better.  And it did, for a couple weeks. But now i'm really struggling to hold back negative thoughts again. That's pretty much the story of everything I've tried to help me. 

And I feel like I really have tried everything. Tried drinking water, getting more sleep. Tried setting up a routine, helped for a little bit, not long though. Tried getting regular exercise. I just feel like shit again as soon as the endorphins wear off. Tried changing my attitude and outlook on things. 

I feel lonely on a level so profound that I cannot fully describe it with words. Surrounded by people, yet unable to connect with, relate to, or have any sort of meaningful shared experience with anyone. I feel totally disconnected from people. No matter how hard I try to make friends, I feel uncared for, like I'm a burden, like my friends would ditch me at the first chance, etc. And i don't know at this point how much is reality and how much is just the voices in my head. 

Dear God, the fucking voices. Not literal voices that I actually hear, but it's the best way I can describe these uncontrollable intrusive thoughts I have. It's like I have this second person within myself, or somebody always whispering in my ear. Things like ""you're worthless"" ""this is all your own damn fault"" ""they probably talk about you behind your back"" ""just shut the fuck up, nobody cares"" ""you're being an overly sensitive sack of shit"". 

I was dealt a bad hand in life, and I made everything worse with my own poor decisions. Born into an impoverished broken home, parents got divorced when I was very young. Had a very unstable family life with an emotionally and verbally abusive step-dad for a few years. Even when things calmed down I had to deal with living in two different places with two different friend groups, two different everything. Which I feel impeded my ability to cement myself into a friend group I could feel like I really belonged in. 

I fell into a depression when I started high school due to a variety of complex factors that would require their own post, and instead of pushing through I allowed myself to neglect school and I got mostly Fs the first two years of high school. Sophomore year if I recall correctly I got straight Fs the whole year except for a couple Cs. Turned it around junior year, but at that point it was too late. You don't really recover from that. So then I had the option of either taking a full 5th year of high school to graduate normally or taking an exam to graduate early. (Not the GED, a state thing) Early in my senior year I opted for the latter and earned the equivalent of a high school diploma, but with a 1.43 High school GPA. I should have just swallowed my pride and taken the 5th year to improve my GPA, because now if I want to go to college I have to go to community college first and then transfer. I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself for my mistakes in High school. 

I'm now a year and a half out of highschool with a big resume gap due to being unemployed for a while due to the pandemic and a part-time job that I don't hate but I also am not thrilled about. I don't know how I'm going to get into the career I want (IT) with such bad Highschool grades and just a professional certificate or something. I definitely might go to college but i'm afraid I'd fail that too. I couldn't even succeed in High school, why should I think I can succeed in college? 

I just feel worthless and stuck. And the hardest part is I know a lot of it is my fault. Mental illness is a contributing factor but I didn't have to allow it to completely stop me from doing what I needed to do. I pushed all my friends away last year because I felt like none of them gave a shit about me. I'm so angry and ashamed with myself. I feel like I deserve this. 

This is getting long, so i'll just shut up now. I already feel like I'm over sharing. I need to get it off my chest though. My feelings are too difficult to describe with words, I feel like this post doesn't do it justice. I tried though. Thanks to anyone who listens..."
Feeling so tired...,1,mlkhmi,1,"I don't know how to make this short without making dry, but let me try. Since I know myself, I have been working towards something, always prioritised school, work, being ""proper"", being a ""people pleaser"". But now, I am burnt out - flat out burnt out. I don't want to lift my arm, get out of bed, or live anymore. What's the point? I used to be able to motivate myself somehow to work on myself with the aim of a more ""meaningful"" life, when I am faced with an existential dread. But I can't do that anymore, nothing changes, and this will never end. I am extremely tired.

I have no one to be intimate romantically or sexually in my life. I am alone, and will die alone. I have not worked on developing those skills in the past 34 years, never dated, never had proper relationships, as I *worked* instead. To be open, I am a 34-years-old virgin, still trying to pass thinking sex as a taboo. Online dating sort of disgusts me - it makes me feel very weird swiping on people like I am shopping a commodity. I am still trying, but I never managed to keep an app in my phone over a week. So, I don't know where and how to find someone to share my life. The most meaningful thing these days has been, I had this crush for someone that I shouldn't (she is already in committed relationship for \~8-10 years) for the past \~1-1.5 years and developed this nice friendship. I feel very close to her and I can only wish to be with her in a parallel universe; but even in that case I am not sure if we are compatible, we think alike, I like talking to her very much, miss her, but never had much chances to spend time in the real life (we are online friends) and there are significant differences in how we have experienced life so far (I have been this child of a super conservative family who didn't roam free much, she has been this bubbly, free spirit character).

 I have been working in my current job for the past 5+ years. I am reasonably successful in my job, but it is very high stress environment. I managed to cope well, worked really hard, and made a name of myself in the company. Now, I have no interest in pursuing anything in this company. But I am unable to change jobs as well, since I have no interest in any of the other jobs and not sure what I can actually do. I can't also simply leave my job, as I am on a visa. If I resign, I need to go back to my home country, which will make my life considerably harder. I don't have energy for any of these, and I can't stop thinking about the corner I pushed myself to. 

In short, this became a bit too much in the past a few days and I haven't managed to leave my bed in the past couple of days. I have no intentions to leave it tomorrow as well, and my sleep is not in its best state. I have been in cycles of feeling absolute rubbish for years now, but I think I may be close to being done. Saying myself ""things will get better"" have no effect anymore and I am not sure how long I can try coping with all this further.  I don't think I am suicidal (too religious upbringing) but I don't know what to do anymore.

I just wanted to tell you my story in brief words, I don't know what I am expecting by writing all this. I am just tired and feeling extremely exhausted. Can someone end this?"

Impossible situation with girlfriend who wants to die,1,mlk8hl,0,"Hi, I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 2+ years now. She is severely depressed and very anxious. For a while now our relationship has not been great, but she knows I support her with all of her MH problems and have made myself available through a lot. She ended up in the hospital after taking a bunch of pills a few months ago, but it wasn't close to being toxic and so they discharged her. The other night, over a small event, she freaked out and sent me a bunch of goodbye texts. I went looking for her (we don't live together) at 1am and had the police out very quickly, we found her at the train station sobbing.. she had missed the last train. That night haunts me for many reasons, but genuinely believing she had ended it meant I was traumatically (I don't have another word for it) crying down every street in the pitch black, scared of what I may find. I was so worried I would see her body across the floor or hung up on a tree. I didn't know what to find but I went to all of our favourite places in the village and I feel so scarred by the night as a whole, it was like I had lost the entire world. I am feeling a multitude of things right now, but mostly I feel traumatised and trapped. That night did something to me (it was a few days ago) and now I just can't shake those feelings, I keep randomly crying remembering those feelings (I kept thinking how she was all alone when she did it and how scared she must be and it broke my heart). I feel so guilty in so many ways because I can't take the pain away. I feel lost as to how to help... On the flip side, I feel frustrated and trapped. Honestly, our relationship shouldn't have lasted (we aren't right together) this long, and we both know that. But our love and care for one another IS forcing us to stay together through her problems. I am okay with the idea of staying together long term if things work out, but I currently feel like I am in the relationship because I have to be rather than I want to be. Because, We both know that if this ended, she would go through with it. I am not here to be told to end the relationship, because I still love her and I am not going to let her be alone through this. I guess I kinda need to vent because I don't want the pain for her, but I am also aware the impact this is having on me and my life. I can't find a way out and the doctors are now saying I need medication to deal with my own anxiety. I can't talk to family / friends about this because I know they would try to make me break up with her, and that isn't an option for my conscience.

"I need to vent, I only live for hope but I don’t think things will get better",1,mlk5d0,1,"I’m mostly writing this for myself just because I need to get my thoughts onto something right now. I think I have pretty bad depression, I’ve taken many tests online even if they are probably not legit they all say I have anywhere from moderate to severe depression. I don’t want to tell any close to me because I don’t want to bring them down with me but I need change soon because I don’t know how long I will last. Whenever I hear someone I know or look up to has depression I feel very sad for them and I don’t want people to feel the same for me. The pressure is just too much, I’m 15 and I have no idea what I want to with my life and I’m failing hard in school because I can’t focus online and got bad luck with my classes. I feel like I’m stuck in a downward spiral and it’s just gonna get worse until it explodes one day. I feel like I don’t have anything to live for except for hope. I met a girl a few months ago and she is really great, I’ve had many crushes before but there is something about her that feels different. It feels like my entire life I’ve been a walking corpse with googles on, but when I’m with her I feel true happiness for the first time and was at peace with myself. She has a great personality and we get along well. She obviously is very hot and she turns me on a lot but the best part about her appearance is her smile. I remember seeing her smile for the first time a few months ago and it honestly changed something in me, it was like an explosion happened in my heart. I over heard her say that she has depression and I cried for hours that night feeling so bad for her. I think I might Also have a sex problem because it’s all I think about if I’m not thinking about suicide and it’s really distracting. Anyway, hope is all I live for now but if I’m being honest with myself it probably won’t get better. Also, I’ve been having really weird dreams recently, most of them about her but some are about me jumping off a building. I really hope you guys have a good day"
I'm at a breaking point and no advice or efforts seem to work anymore. I'm so scared.,3,mlk1d1,1,"I don't know where to begin with this post.

I'm 19 and finishing up my senior year of high school. **I redid my junior year** due to mental health issues (got hospitalized in 2019). At the time the issues were severe OCD and social anxiety. Those don't seem to be my issues currently. I've been depressed pretty much my whole life, even as a child. Usually, it's the type of depression that makes me numb, cry in bed and contemplate suicide, which is why I'm unsure if I'm actually depressed right now or if it's something else.

**I have no energy to do anything anymore.** I went from being a straight-A student my whole life to failing everything. I'm scared I won't graduate. I believe the reason for my change in grades is because the only thing fueling my A's in the past was severe anxiety, fear of what my teachers would do if I didn't do everything perfectly and on time. Ever since my severe mental breakdown in 2019, this fear has vanished. So I have no motivator to get me through schoolwork. **Even the fear of homelessness doesn't motivate me**, and I truly believe that if that doesn't motivate me, nothing will. (My parents seriously threatened to send me to a shelter a year ago, as soon as I turned 18.)

Speaking of 2019, I feel like something permanently broke in my brain. I went nonverbal nearly the entire year, screamed at the top of my lungs if my parents tried to talk to me, hid in my bedroom closet, ripped my hair out, etc. **I feel like I have permanent brain damage** from this but my therapist just laughed when I told her, which didn't help. I'm much better now in many ways than I was in 2019. Quarantine helped. But one thing got worse: my energy. It's gone. That's why I feel I'm broken.

I got **blood tested** for *hundreds* of different things -- not even a hyperbole. All my hormones, any possible deficiency possible (the list was endless), organ function, even celiac disease. Every single thing came back normal. I told myself that if they didn't find a problem in my blood test, that I would commit suicide because I'm a lost cause. Unfortunately, I'm too scared to do that.

I've had ADHD since I was a little kid (or since I was born, I guess). I didn't realize it was ADHD until a year ago. I got medicated. None of the different meds I tried helped much and none of them solve my energy problem. **So it's not the ADHD**, especially since I didn't have this energy problem as a kid**.** I've been prescribed different **antidepressants** over the years but I've had severe reactions to all of them. One (wellbutrin) even caused a terrifying psychotic break that resulted in PTSD. I'm likely bipolar, which would explain the reactions, but I haven't had any episodes as of late so I'm waiting on that. Doctors always scoff at me when I suggest an illness anyways.

**Let's talk about the internet.** The internet has slowly destroyed me since middle school. I know it's at least partially responsible for my issues, and it has only gotten worse because I have absolutely **no friends** anymore and I use it to cope. It's *destroyed* my attention span, gives me instant gratification, laziness, increased anger issues, etc. But I can't figure out how to stop. **All of my schoolwork is online**. I actually have an IEP so I might be able to have my in-person teacher make physical paper copies of my schoolwork, but that won't solve everything since two of my classes are on VLACS (an online school). I spend all day rotating between Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and Netflix. I've deactivated my Twitter account many times but I always reactivate it. I've tried using website blockers but I always turn them off.

I feel so **humiliated** and alone. My relationship with my family is shit, with my teachers is shit, I have no friends, my therapist isn't helpful, I don't have a job, I don't have a license (but I'm getting better at driving every day, so there's that), and my school case manager is getting annoyed with me. I stay in my room all day, other than to go for a walk outside. **I'm too tired to get out of bed** even though I set up a desk in my room to do schoolwork. Even just moving to my desk is exhausting.

I've been increasing my physical **exercise** this year **but it hasn't changed anything.** I could definitely work on exercising a lot more though, but I'm scared it'll just make me even more tired. I always make sure to eat more and take in more protein after exercising, too.

I forgot to mention this, but **I'm diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder**, which honest to God is a death sentence. If you don't know what that is, it's more than just ""social anxiety on steroids."" It's a severe avoidance of *everything* in life, and there are no therapists in my area who treat it. Even my own therapist didn't know what it was.

I don't know what's happening to me and I'm so scared. I know this was a long post but if anyone has any advice, *please* reply."
"This year has been tough, thinking about moving back home",1,mlk0bv,2,"I moved for a job about 2 years ago. I like it in my new city but I have no doubt that I miss home. My family, my friends, the familiarity of it. The pandemic has made it harder but I can’t shake the feeling that even without it I’d still feel the same (perhaps not to the same degree, but still). I moved out here to experience something new and I have. There are parts that are incredible. But I miss the people back home and feel like my relationships with those people are suffering because of how far away we are from each other. 

I also feel like if I move home I’m giving up on growing and experiencing something different. Its definitely a more difficult life here and I think moving back will be admitting failure that I’m not cut out for it. At the same time I keep thinking I’m missing out on years of my life that should be spent with the people that I love the most (my family mostly)."

What is it about depression that is so comforting?,1,mljxea,0,"Everything that should make me feel better like working out or seeing friends or being productive is just soooo fucking hard for me. Like seriously, I feel so much resistance. I would rather go skydiving right now than finish this school task I have in front of me. What is it about being stagnant and suffering that's so comforting and seducing"
Is there ever a way out,1,mljvez,0,Typing this crying I just want to end it all there is no way out everyone's let me down In life all my friends my family and especially the mental health care system my therapist is manipulating and grooming me and my CPS worker fails to even try to help me
There is nothing wrong with my life,2,mljrql,2,"I have a great job, kind wife, sweet daughter and another kid on the way. We don’t struggle with money, we are even able to spoil ourselves within reason. With all that being said, I can’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I hate the person staring back at me. I’ve had depression my whole life with highs and lows. But now... it just feels different. I think about my life and I’m absolutely ashamed of myself. Things I did when I was younger, things that no one else remembers and aren’t even a big deal now, make me shudder when I think about it. I stay up at night thinking about “that one time I was really rude to that person who was really sweet to me”, “why did I not play basketball?”, “why was I the class clown?”.. stuff like that. I don’t think I’m suicidal but I’ve thought a lot about how I would do it were I to do it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I think it’s about time to ask for help but I don’t know where to start, that’s why I’m here."
I just want to feel alive,2,mljrf0,0,"The past 2 years or so I have been managing my depression pretty well. I got help, have fantastic goals for the future, and mostly overcame my suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Yes I am proud of myself for that. I just want to talk about how hard it is sometimes. Ever since I've ""improved"" life itself has not gotten much better, I am more mentally resilient and I am slowly achieving some goals but other than that no drastic changes have been made. Constant adversity makes it hard to be resilient and has been slowly taking its toll on me. 

The biggest thing I am talking about is the Covid pandemic. It has made things feel fucking impossible for a person like me. At 21 nearing 22, I have never had a job, have no friends in person, never had a girlfriend. I have the drive to do all these things but I am insanely frustrated with it because of the circumstances. I see all my friends (who I don't know in person) getting into relationships and getting jobs. Hell one of my friends is getting married and got a job for 80k during the fucking pandemic. I can't help but just blame myself for all of that, other people are progressing during the pandemic and I can't seem to land a job at Burger King. I am having a hard time justifying this because I have done a lot of work in the past year. I transferred out of community college with As and Bs, I have learned a language at a basic level, I have gotten decently fit, I have mostly learned how to drive. But these things just feel.. so slow. I am not progressing very fast or receiving any kind of immediate benefit from these things. 

I am not suicidal (at the moment), I just feel defeated. I am angry and frustrated, I burst out into tears over small things in front of my family. I had to drop a class this semester and had to do 10 hours of homework during the weekend because I had to see and help my dying grandfather all last week. It doesn't help that I have been turning to porn and video games like old times because they are the only things that distract me from the feelings of pain and stress. Home life is not great, I am constantly being screamed at by my narcissistic sibling who makes fun of me for showing emotion, my mom will be gone for a few weeks/months, my dad I get along with but he doesn't really understand depression and is busy. So out of the two people I actually get to talk to, one is openly hostile and the other is distant. Online friends sometimes help but I am not too close with most and some don't seem to really understand. I keep telling myself it will be over soon and things will magically turn around for me when the pandemic ends but I am have been getting more pessimistic recently.

Don't mean to write a college essay, but this has been really bothering me for months now. I am mostly just venting because I am frustrated."
I need something to hold onto.,1,mljr4v,0,"Not a long post... It's to vent. 

So today I fucked up. I had way too much food so I'm drowning on guilt, I'm lonely, tired of people but want a hug. 

I want to feel safe. I don't think this can ever happen. No matter how good things get I will always be scared of loosing all my money, getting sick, getting fired or whatever. 

Everything would be so much easier if he hadn't addict me to light."
I finally understand the thoughts behind a suicidal person.,1,mljqe0,3,"I never thought this would happen to me. I really didn’t think it would happen during what should be a very happy time in my life— moving off to a new state, starting graduate school in something I love, getting started with my life. But now I finally get it. I thought I’d feel better once spring hit, but here I am only 10 feet deeper than I was before. I don’t know what’s going on with me. I can’t even cry about it to let any part of me feel real any more. I’m tired."
First ever crush making me go insane,1,mljkha,3,"I’m 23 F and never been in a relo, never liked a guy and am a virgin. I was questioning whether I was asexual but a few months ago, for the first time ever, a guy I had an Internet crush on wanted to be friends irl and now i have a rl crush on him (probably bordering on manic infatuation by now).

I had no idea having an unreciprocated crush would drive me this insane..

(Obvs I’m in this forum for a reason and I have a bunch of mental illnesses + my life in general is miserable). So having to deal w these new feelings in this new situation has made my mental instability go off the rails. 

Me and him get along so well, talk everyday, have so many niche shared interests, same humour etc; it literally feels like we’re the same person. Yet I’ve never felt more subtly rejected by a guy ever. He doesn’t even platonically flirt w me and I do that w everybody!!!! I’ve been feeling extremely insecure, hideous, lame + anxious bc of him. I keep getting upset by little things like late replies or when he doesn’t invite me somewhere etc (but I keep that to myself). He hasn’t done anything wrong it’s just ME being unable to cope w the fact that I’m being friendzoned by the only guy I’ve ever liked in my life... 

I def have attachment issues and Im starting to think I have bpd honestly. I can’t stop thinking/fantasising about him and psychoanalysing everything it’s just so weird I’m even feeling like this what the hell ???!! God I just feel so sad cos it feels like I can’t have anything in this life

Edit: I keep spiralling and thinking it’s my looks. It’s gotta be my looks. If I was prettier he’d probably have made a move by now. But maybe that’s not the case. I really should just tell him but I don’t wanna make things weird between us. Tbh I need to just move the fuck on but I’ve literally never moved on from anything in my life lol"
I think I'm having a nervous breakdown - too scared to leave my bed,1,mljiw4,1,"A few days ago I completely tapered off my SSRIS. This past week has been very tough for me. Alot of things went wrong, I fell sick, and my cat is dying due to an unidentified illness the vets can't figure out (viral gastritis that's just getting worse and worse). I'm trying my best with her, but those panic attacks and the terrified visits to the vet back and forth whilst I was sick myself really triggered a PTSD episode. I watched my mom die when I was 13, then my grandmother at 20 (who brought me up in my teenage years). I've had my cat for a year, and now watching her waste away (there's still hope. She may not die. But the vets have said her prognosis is guarded) has triggered my really badly. I'm also currently in a really bad family situation (which I can't escape for another couple of months.)
So all in all, I can't eat. I'm nauseous all day. Constant GIT issues. I can't get out of bed. I cry on and off all day. The idea of facing the world is terrifying me. I feel like I can't cope any longer. I don't know what to do or how to get past this. I don't wanna start meds again. But i need to know how to not be terrified of the world rn. My partner is stuck in another city due to quarantine (which is why I'm stuck with family, who are just toxic.) It feels like the world is crashing on me rn."
Ever feel guilty about being depressed?,1,mljhrp,0,"If I look around my life there are so many things to be grateful for. The world is full of cool things, and I want to see them but I feel so empty. I was raised in a very constricted environment and feel like my life has been built and set for me and I don't know if I actually like any of it. I feel too indebted to my parents to choose a different path and I don't even know how I would start. I've recently started therapy and meds for anxiety and lowkey depression, and I've struggled with being suicidal, bulimic, and anxious for pretty much my whole life. Every time I think things are about to actually get to the point where I am happy to be alive I get kicked down. Corona made me feel so lonely and put me back in my home environment, which wasn't exactly healthy. I was trying to get my life back together. I was sexually assaulted a week ago, so now I'm just so entirely over this whole existing thing. I want to love my life and be happy and see the world but I feel trapped and like the things that would get me out of this hole are unattainable."

I fucking hate it. I wish I could just end it but I won’t since I’m a big pussy. Although I’m starting to worry a little because now I’m just starting to feel like my life wasn’t real?? Like it was all a dream or something and now I have to go. I don’t know where I need to go or where I will go but my brain is telling me that there’s nothing here for me and that I need to go.

How do I support my partner with depression,2,mlj9up,0,"My partner and I have recently split up after several months of him struggling with depression and refusing to acknowledge or talk about it, while also neglecting me. I want nothing more than for him to get better so that we can get back together, but right now, he doesn't want to have anything to do with me. He doesn't want help. I'm scared he's in a dark place but I don't want to keep pushing. How do I support him in a way that he will be receptive right now? Should I give him some space and wait for him to reach out? Should I reach out to him and let him know I am here? I keep going back and forth on what to do, because I'm scared that anything I do or say will upset him at this point."

nothing makes me happy anymore,1,mlj8zt,3,"i’ve finally reached the point where nothing interests me or even makes me happy. I have no motivation or drive for anything. like i’m just here, waiting to leave. whenever that may happen."
Something that gets me is the absolute degradation of trust I have in friends and people.,2,mlj71v,0,"No one had proven to be someone I can truly trust in. I see thru my family and all their faulty advice they give me. A friend of mine says I can look to him for advice, like an older brother, but I am too aware of his biases, his differing / opposing motives that make me realize he is not truly for me.

 I've got no role models, save for distant famous individuals who are just concealed enough for you to project idealistic beliefs onto. My role models have been shit since birth and now I'm paying for it. 

But it's just the nature of life to be neither black or white, but excessively grey. There seems to be nothing I can really trust. Is it supposed to feel this lonely? How am I expected to cope with existence? Is it every person for themselves, and if so, why am I supposed to care for this being that I never asked for? "

Why?,5,mliyts,2,"Why do they lock you up and torture you, just because yo ucant take the pain anymore? Im talking about mental hospitals.

Unable to Graduate,10,mlixtf,2,"I'm in the worst situation imaginable. I'm a senior in college and this was supposed to be my last semester in order to get my Bachelors Degree. I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since I was 16 and I'm 21 now. I was doing OK for a while and then suddenly my depression got significantly worse in the middle of this semester, to the point where I struggle getting out bed now. I've completely lost motivation to do absolutely anything and everything just appears pointless right now. And now I'm failing multiple classes because I literally cannot get any work done.

What makes this so much worse is that I have a job lined up for after graduation which I'm supposed to start in June, and it was my dream job. If I don't graduate in May like I was supposed to, there is absolutely 0 chance that I can keep the job. I have absolutely no idea why my luck is so bad that my depressive symptoms hit harder than ever before at the worst possible time. Fuck this disease."

Are these changes permanent?,1,mliwgq,2,"So i got super depressed over quarantine. I had dealt with little bits in the past, but never anything that required actual medical help or interfered with work. but now it's very much at that point.

thing is, i feel like i've already seen behind the curtain, you know? i acknowledged how shitty a lot of things are, and even on the days the pills work, none of that shittiness goes away. It's just medication that i guess helps you forget about it? but it's still there in the back of my mind and then it feels like the effect of he medication is just... i don't know, arbitrary? like it's not fixing any problems, just helping you ignore it.

Anyways as i get closer to deciding to quit my job, i keep struggling with the idea that this is temporary, and maybe someday in a few months i'll magically revert back to how i was before then i'll have all the passion for work back. 

but idk if that will actually happen. have people made similar  decisions and ended up regretting it? or do you find usually your gut is right in these situations?"
Eating way to much junk food,8,mlioxf,1,"Ok so recently I've been feeling more depressed and whenever I'm depressed eat a crap ton of ice cream/candy/Doritos. I will fully admit I have an addiction to junk food and I need help because it's gotten to a point where I can't go a single day without eating or drinking something sugary. I realize there are much worse things out there to be addicted to but it's actually gotten to a point where I've been eating more junk food than regular food and I've noticed some discomfort in my chest about a week ago. I'm sure it has to do with all the crap I've been eating these past few weeks.  My dad's side of the family has a history of heart problems so I do worry a little but about how this will effect me. No matter how hard I try to not eat that stuff it's always a mixture of my depressive state because eating junk food does legit make me feel better like it gives me more energy and also the fact that I fiend really hard for it if I go a whole day without eating junk food.

Also I wanna clarify I'm only 20 years old and I don't wanna have heart problems this early in life cause I could only imagine how bad it would get latter in life. Also I'm actually on the skinner side believe it or not and I do hike and play pickup basketball to stay in shape so it's not like I'm totally inactive. But the point is the depression I feel caused a junk food addiction that I can't break for the life of me and while I might feel better in the short term when I think about the long term it makes me scared for what's to come."
College Student Failing Classes and Overthinking myself to Death,9,mlijb3,5,"I am not doing anything. I’m failing all my college classes. And honestly? I don’t even know if I am just being lazy, or if I am actually incapable of doing them. This is because, a month or so ago, I totally got burnt out, lost my motivation to do anything, and decided that if I was ever going to recover from that burnout, I needed to stop holding myself responsible to the expectation that I do well in school, that I recover, that everything ends up “okay” in May. That expectation itself was too much of a burden. So, okay, I go and remove that burden. It helps my mental a lot. Except that the burden is being enforced by the people I love, externally – AKA, my friends, roommate, and parents (all while being very supportive and kind) I can tell fundamentally have an expectation for me to make it okay. And that external force is a burden, too. But I can’t exactly complain about them wanting me to have a facsimile of success – they are doing so in the most supportive way I can imagine. I cannot tell if the immense amount of friction I feel is because I did the right thing and am just still not ready to “get back on the horse” but the pushback from them is making me doubt, or if I genuinely did the wrong thing and regret it and need to keep pushing. But at any rate, I have no idea how to keep pushing. The problem is that I have the burden of expectations from those who love me, but not the social input from them to actually become motivated enough through their external expectations. And my internal circumstances certainly aren’t conducive to doing my work on their own. It’s interesting, how much my fundamental mode of doing work relied on having other people to enforce it. I wonder if I’ve always been doing my schoolwork and going to college through the motivation of others, like some sort of leech – or, less terribly, benignly using social interaction as a way to recharge, without burdening them more. I was diagnosed with depression a few weeks ago and put on medication. I think I have ADHD. But since I’m not formally diagnosed with ADHD, I feel bad about claiming to have it so I don’t, leading to a hell of a lot of impostor syndrome because I’m simultaneously actively getting diagnosed for it, yet don’t let myself think I have it enough to actually excuse my own actions internally. If you can’t tell, I’m dragging my feet through this shit. That’s my specialty, after all: thinking so much about how I might feel or should feel that I obfuscate my actual emotional response and deny myself that critical information, overthink myself to death and stack layer upon layer of thought on it until it develops a confusing patina of thinking so thick it gums up my brain and needs frequent removal (which I’m also uncertain of how to do effectively).

Posting here because I figure someone else must be going through some similar thoughts, and maybe would be able to help or simply empathize with me."
First time taking zoloft,2,mlihb0,2,"So, my doctor prescribed me 50mg of zoloft for my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I haven't started it until now because I was on the fence about it, but my therapist encouraged it so I eventually warmed up to the idea. I'm not sure when to start taking my doses, because on the label it says to not drive or do anything until I know how it affects me, but would it be okay to start them on a day I have to drive to work? Or should I start them on a day I have off?"

How do you deal with things you do that uncharacteristic of you ?,1,mliavf,0,"So my depression and anxiety journey started last fall and things have been all over the place. 

My mood has improved but my memory is really shot and that causes me great anxiety spiralling down into fear and hopelessness. Before this, when i was severely depressed I did not really care about my memory was just waiting to die. So I took my memory for granted all these years and dont really have tools to handle this steep decline. I read and reread sentences to grasp them, better at comprehending text than conversations. When I talk to people they expect the former me. 

How do you deal with this ? Any coping mechanisms I could use at work ? 

Learning new things is also more difficult. It feels like I have to read many many articles  about a topic when I can say I can say I fully understand. So my comprehension time has increased 10 fold. 

What coping mechanisms for this ?

"So I’m a 29yo Mechanical Engineering student who graduates in May and I am realizing I may be suffering from mild depression symptoms that only appear to occur towards the evening time around sunset. I start to feel this numb, empty, melancholy type feeling.",1,mlhyf1,0,"It gets so unbearable at times that I end up just going to sleep to avoid feeling that way. One time I went to bed at like 6:40pm due to it being just so uncomfortable. I feel completely fine in the mornings and afternoons. I am an engineering intern and I am for the most part a productive worker. I am a successful honor student (will graduate with Magna cum Laude honors) and I have a very loving and supportive girlfriend. The bad things that could be the cause of these symptoms are the following: 1.) Last March one of my cousins got murdered by her husband. 2.) My older sister found out that our younger bro (19 at the time) was molesting her second oldest son (our nephew); he is currently in jail on his way to prison I presume. 3.) My family are always at odds with each other and with the exception of my cousins funeral last year, I like never visit them, interact with them or do much of anything with them. 4.) This pandemic has restricted my ability to socialize with my colleagues like we normally would and I been working from home since last March and I am like ALWAYS in the house. I do try to get some fresh air in the backyard but I think this whole pandemic could be the cause as well..I want to add that I am a very resilient person and I have gone through a lot in my life but I’ve never let it get in the way of my goals. I just am struggling with this night time depression and could just use some help with getting through this...Thanks for reading."

Despite countless applications and a handful of interviews, no job offers had ever surfaced. The more applications get rejected or ghosted, the more I feel as if there is nothing for me to live for. Some may say that getting laid off is a good thing because they think there are always better opportunities, but that is far from the truth.

What’s the truth? Please read. Where do I go from here? Am I faking it? What do I do?????,3,mlhhrk,5,"I’m so tired of seeing depression all over the internet. How many people are ACTUALLY depressed? I’ve always been a happy person and I’d always say “I can’t be depressed I hate how people make it a trend my life it’s great. It’s offensive for me to claim I am depressed because there are ACTUAL depressed people dealing with hell” but recently I just feel like shit. I feel like I’m bitching I really do. I’ve tried so much. I take vitamin d daily, I exercise, I am on a keto diet which has been known to be good for your mood, I quit all drugs( never got addicted to anything except weed) I have not smoked in 3-4 months and I don’t want to at least not for a long time. I’m in college, I’m pretty, i have 2 jobs and good money, a great family. I do have an eating disorder, I binge/ starve but my weight is varies from normal, to average to slightly overweight. The thing is I’ve had an eating disorder for 6 years and I was never truly unhappy until recently, so I don’t want to instantly blame my ED. I don’t look overweight since I workout. Like I give myself credit I am not ugly if I am being honest. I have great genetics, physically at least. Like my life is decent. I quit drinking tons of caffeine and energy drinks I only have 2-3 cups of coffee a day. Not addicted to nicotine

Recently I’ve just been so down. But the thing is it’s not all the time, some days I feel GREAT. Like my brain is just filled with good happy energy. It feels weird I’m just like “wow I feel so good I wonder if it will last” like I just had a good line of coke. Then other days I feel dead. I wake up and it’s just like a huge heart ache. I have been crying a lot more recently. Random waves of sadness. Two days ago I spent the whole day crying bawling my eyes out from the pain of sadness I’ve been feeling in my chest. I’ve never been that sad for a whole day in my life. I have randomly gotten sad at the gym and go to the bathroom to cry., idk I take a picture or note every time I cry just to see how often I cry to see how serious I should take this sadness. I enjoy crying. I just want to cry. Idk. I’ve also been cutting my self and I’m stopping that. I don’t do it deep but idk it’s fun sometimes. I have not told anyone I cut. I do it on my legs. I just wish I could wake up eat like a normal person, go to work, go to the gym, lose weight, be happy with my body, go out every now and then, be able to do my homework and just have it be easy. I get life is not easy but it feels so ridiculously hard. It was not like this when I was 14 or 15. It started getting worse by the year. 

I feel like I’m just bitching. Everyone has “depression” nowadays. All I want is to have consistent happy days filled with good energy without obsessing over food. How do I tell if this is real depression or if I am just being a little bitch? I feel like it’s so easy to see someone cut a few times or cry few times a month and be like “yeah they are depressed” like that’s not how it works. My father has serious issues but is in denial. I don’t know what he has , I’m not close with him but he is not normal. He has serious anger issues. Maybe it’s genetic? I don’t know

I don’t necessarily want depression, but I want to officially be diagnosed with it just do I could have a reason for why this is all happening to me and so I could work on fixing it. Of course I wish I could just be a normal person, I just want to be diagnosed with SOMETHING just so I could have a reason for all this crap and so I could work on fixing it whether it’s medication or therapy idc. I don’t have time to go to a doctor I work a lot for my family and school. How do I tell if this is real or if I am just bitching? Is life supposed to be this hard???? I don’t know what to do anymore?! Everyone claims to be depressed nowadays what if I’m just one of those people????? Please help I’m so tired of this. Is this the beginning stage? Will it get worse?"
"TW: Depression, SH",2,mlhbe1,0," I was a high functioning mentally ill person for all my teenage years until this year. I'm 21 years old and I've never been this low in my entire life, I feel like blinking is a chore and I find myself to stop breathing frequently. I get plenty of sleep, but always tired. I overeat like an ogre, or starve. Last week I fell on the ground and could not get up because  I had absolutely no energy, not even to chew food. 

I have school 35h/week, and it's only memory shit. My memory is absolute shit. All my energy goes into studying and I can't stand straight anymore. I can't finish sentences, I can't recognize myself, I can't feel anything but agonizing anxiety and pain. 

I've been wanting to stap myself for a while, to feel something, but it would be messy. I would get drunk and SF, saying over and over again how much I want to die. 

I'm on a waiting list for a psychologist and have no plans to kms, but I also don't know bc there's a possibility I might snap, who knows. 

I want peace of mind, I'm tired."
I'm not a bad person. I just make bad decisions. REALLY REALLY BAD decision.,5,mlhb3f,2,"I cheated on my ex and fell in love with the girl i cheated on her with. Now I lost both of them. Which I know I deserve. 

I dont want to use my depression to justify my cheating. I admit I was wrong in doing that. Believe me, I am fully aware of what I did and I am living every moment of my life right now thinking that I deserve being alone.

The idea of suicide gives me hope,3,mlha02,0,"That is the only source of hope I have rn. That I can end this pain anytime I want for final.

Do you cry when stressed or anxious?,2,mlh7d9,2,If your not super sad/depressed in the moment just stressed & anxious do you find you can cry or do other things work better for you? I'm asking this cuz usually I cry a lot for depression feelings & its proven to help lower stress but I feel like it would be forced if I try to cry right now
Just need to get it out because I have no one to talk to,1,mlh3w2,1,"I am having a really bad time right now and my self-esteem is hitting rock bottom. On the surface, I'm a high functioning person - I'm a graduate student in a good school with a resume that people would dream of. But in reality, a lot of my accomplishments and overachieving arose from attempting to garner love and praise from any teacher or peer willing to provide. I grew up in a house of poverty and emotional abuse and academic success was all I had.

I've sacrificed everything and busted my ass to get where I am. But at the end of the day, isolated in my room as I work my job for 5 hours, attend online classes at a university I've never visited in person and have no real friends in, and do assignments everyday until 2/3 am, I feel like life isn't worth living. 

Before, I pushed everyone away to prioritize my education and career. Now in the pandemic, I've pushed everyone away because I think I inherently don't deserve love. I think once they find out how much I hate myself , my tumultuous emotions, and the depth of my depression, I will be rejected. And why subject others to someone like me, someone so undeserving who would just waste their time and efforts only to be disappointed when they can't save me. It's easier this way. 

I'm still stuck in the house with my controlling family. This was the year I was supposed to move away and finally go to school on the other side of the country. I would finally be free and be happy and bare the fruits of my labour. Now, things have changed. Instead, I feel like I'm trapped into eternal high expectations and perpetual grinding effort for minimal personal reward. I'm so sad to wake up every day to high pressure work and constant feelings of inadequacy. I spend days alone in my room working away and when I'm with my boyfriend, I'm always working and stressed. I've gained weight. I've become bitter and ugly. I've become someone I never wanted to be."
I am sick and the doctors are just calling me fat,1,mlgx67,2,"I'm feeling unwell since last year, this is not the depression, I know it cause I've been depressed for over 12 years, this is something else entirely, I'm always aching like I have the flu but I have no fever or anything else, my bones hurt, I'm always fatigued as if I had run a marathon, but I clearly didn't , it's come to a pint were it is messing with my life, and when I go to the doctor they just say I'm fat and try to imply I must eat too much or too badly, the truth is I rarely eat out, i most eat home cooked meals and yes, I've been overweight for a while as at the worst of my depression tent to overeat, but I know my body, and this feels unlike anything I've felt before. I'm not here looking for answers, as I know this is not remotely the place for that, but I just feel so depressed now because of the constant dismiss of my symptoms by my doctors, it is like they are not listening to what comes out of my mouth... I'm in pain constantly and I don't know what to do, and like always my brains first reaction is to think about ending my life cause right now I cannot figure out another course of action. I'm currently taking my meds as prescribed and I've been emotionally estable for a while now... But this situation right now is beyond me, and I'm so tired of keeping my head straight and dealing with the doctor's making me feel like shit when I already feel like the biggest shit in the planet.... I just want to sleep and I can't even do that cause I have to work... I hate my life so much right now ...."
Looking for any help with some career advice?,1,mlgwrf,0,"Curious how other people have handled this sort of situation. Currently i just can't find any motivation to work (which is also school for me). I guess I was looking to see if other people have wound up finding that a major career change or even just moving to a new area might help. I feel like i've run out of things to try, but i'm pretty worried since dropping out is a one-way street in most cases."
Life in this World=Depression & Death,1,mlgrmd,0,"We've all had dreams, goals, ideals for the future, and yet almost no one ever reaches them. This is because the world is not made for dreams. It is made to put you into a system that breaks you down to a slave; who will do anything to support the people in power's dreams, while you can only try to stave off starvation and loneliness. No one cares about anyone, everyone is a disgusting, self-centered, envious, narcissistic, self-absorbed piece of scum sucking trash. No one cares about how you want to live your life, they only want people to be as miserable and dissatisfied with their wasted lives as they are, and nothing will ever change that. I've wanted to do one thing in life, and yet at every turn I am barred from it, and forced along a path of supplication and servitude. If I cannot live the life I truly desire with every fibre of my being, than I should just kill myself; after all what is the point in living life, if it is not a life you wish to live?"
About as succinct a description as I’ve ever heard ... I wish more people who don’t understand depression would realize this ...,1,mlgnue,3,"This is a short few sentence clip from the Netflix series Ozark when the character Wendy Byrde (Laura Linney) describes what it’s like to suffer from depression ...

I cry each time I hear this."
Come to such a depressing realization.,2,mlglnz,1,"I am fully aware now that the problem is not me. I always thought there was something wrong with me and couldn't understand why people were so harsh and disinterested in others, always relating everything back to them and maintained this superficial crap, now I realize that is how humanity and society operates. I could never play the game of running around being super productive and being this super interesting person, that society and humanity seems to expect of people. 

I realize nobody gives a f*ck, everyone is so focused on their own car payments, insurance, job, family, health, on and on that nobody could give a rats ass about you, sure their are the exceptional few who will help you if your down and many will do the whole I'm sorry and maybe even feel it, but we live in our own isolated bubbles and our goal 99.9% of the time is to maintain that bubble. For example someone, who has a stable life going for themselves isn't going to want to interrupt that and bring someone who isn't doing financially well or who isn't mentally stable into that.

 But that is the problem to me is people constantly wanting to maintain their crap. For example, I tried to be friendly and make friends with this class I was in, I was very open and I wasn't pushy but a down to earth kind person, I am anyway but I did it extra, someone you couldn't help but want to be friends with, sure call me manipulative but it was a test to see how open people are to someone who is no threat at all. Well nobody wanted to be my friend. They all were polite and respectful and treated me well but not one person wanted to connect as friends and that said it all to me really, people are so obsessed with their stuff that they would lose out on being friends with a very kind person.

 Now you could say that is also the way classes operate, you go there act all nice for the months your there and then pretty much forget about each other, to me that shows how shallow people are, they only connect and show goodness when it's convenient for them. Its all about what a person wants, this is our selfish human race, everyone is out for themselves and when someone has the opportunity to make friends with a caring kind person they don't even care to take it. I'm no longer feeling the sting and pain of rejection of feeling so misunderstood, I'm not feeling sorry for how sad and pathetic it is. They wanted their cert for the course and then to bounce, and while their doing it they will entertain you but after they get it, its lets move on to the next thing and then be all fake nice again, it's such b*llshit."
I thought I was finally okay... I was wrong.,1,mlgj2i,5,"Before writing this I was doing absolutely great. After years upon years of endless self-hatred I finally thought the battle was over. The past few days I haven't been doing well at all, even worse then my past battle. I don't want to die, but I sure as hell don't want to live with the pain anymore, I just want to be happy again. That past month was the best days I can remember, going out, having fun, being back to myself... But now? I've just been thrown back down even further. Most people have friends that if they had seen them standing at the top of a building getting ready to jump, would do everything in their power to stop them and that is beautiful to see but if the tables were turned, it only causes an immense amount of pain knowing that no one would even try to stop me. I can't take it, everytime I walk out of my room, someone has to comment on ""how terrible I look"" I know I look like absolute shit. I don't need someone to remind me. I'm sick of having mental breakdowns, I'm sick of dealing with being super sad everyday. I'm sick of people calling me ""lazy"" because I don't get my work done. I'm sick of feeling like I ""fake"" depression for attention. I don't fake it but it feels like it everytime I try to get shit off my chest. Talking doesn't clear my mind, it only fills it more. I'm just done with everything. I'm done trying to be nice to everyone, I'm done talking to people. No one noticed the tears, no one noticed the pain, no one noticed that I'm not actually me anymore, but they all notice every single mistake I've made and never drop it. I'm sorry for being who I am, I'm working everyday to try and change it as I hate myself just as much as everyone else hates me. I just want to be someone else so atleast one person will care about my well being, even if they are faking it. I just want one person who I can call my friend to share memories with is that too much to ask? I guess so..."
"The problem is me, not depression",1,mlgha9,6,"I understand the desire to frame the way I feel about myself and my life in terms of ""oh it's just depression"" but that isn't the reality of the situation. I am the problem in everything that is wrong with my life, always have been always will be. 

If I'm depressed, then that is a normal and valid reaction to being such a shit awful human being. I'm just a talentless, joyless, awful person and that is what creates so many problems for myself and other people. My life would be fine if I was literally anybody else but no, I had the bad luck to exist as the shitty subhuman that I am. I wish I could feel better, I honestly do, but I'm keenly aware that that would require being a completely different person which unfortunately can't happen. I'm pretty much stuck like this, so I'm not quite sure what I can even do at this point. The part of my life where I could achieve relationships or success is basically over so I have nowhere to go from here."
At what dose did Amitriptyline start working for you?,1,mlggpj,2,"I take Amitriptyline for 3 months now and had no effects or relief in depression, pain or anxiety at all. I’m also in a behavioral therapy. My doc just increased my dose from 100 to 125mg 5 days ago and told me that we can increase to 150-200mg max if it still doesn’t give me any effects and relief/improvements of my symptoms. I hope that now on 125mg it will have some effect.

At what dose did Amitriptyline start working for you regarding depression and anxiety or mood, motivation/energy, sociability and such? Is it possible that 125/150/200mg will help me if 100mg didn‘t work for me?

What do the effects of Amitriptyline feel like for you? What changes did you notice regarding mood, energy/motivation, sociability, talkativeness and anxiety?"

Inform work without them legally hamstrung,2,mld7es,5,"I have severe depression and lockdown has made it worse. At the moment I have 'migranes' when I'm actually having a debilitatingly bad day. 

The last place I worked at, my depression would regularly take me out. The HR team knew and were very supportive. Actually to a fault. You see, for a long period my work was sub par. Sometimes I couldn't come in for work and missed important meetings. It got to a point that no one wanted me on their projects because I was so incapable of being useful. If it were anyone else, they would probably have fired me. But I fear they couldn't fire me because they knew of my condition and they didn't want to open themselves up legally. It felt terrible.

My work now are getting the feeling something is wrong with me because my 'migranes' are causing me to lose enthusiasm and miss meetings. They even said that I showed massive improvement...the real me...when I put in a few weeks of normal work. I had just adjusted my medication but they didn't know that. They don't know I have severe depression.

Losing your best friend,1,mlfwno,1,"Hey everyone, 

My ex girlfriend was the first person I ever truly fell in love with. We met when I was 21, and dated for 2 years. Since then we’ve become best friends and she means the absolute world to me. I admire this person a lot, and there is no one with whom I have so many laughs so effortlessly. We hangout multiple times per week! 

She is moving away, and I’m pretty devastated. I’m already struggling with depression and anxiety, and the thought of my best friend being gone is horrifying. I feel so sad yet so empty. 

Has anyone lost a friend in this way? I know we are still friends, but not getting so see one another anymore is so tough for me. She’s my rock. How do you handle the sadness and pain associated with this kind of change in life? I’m lucky enough to say I haven’t dealt with this kind of experience until now."
"Unbereable anxiety and depression, addicted to benzos, suicidal and see no way out",2,mlftx6,2,"Hello everyone,

I apologize in advance for the long post but this is something I really need to get off my chest and I believe people here will understand my predicament. They may also hate me as I believe I genuinely suck as a human being.

&#x200B;

I am a 24 year old male living in Slovakia (central/eastern europe), I am currently not employed nor am I in education, I have failed university three times now, going to try again next year. About a month and a half ago my GF of 4 years broke up with me suddenly and I later discovered she was cheating on me for about a month prior, so that was another nail in the coffin (I was drinking heavily in the months prior to the breakup so I don't think it's fair to put all the blame on her). Also, I am severely addicted to benzodiazepines, I have convinced my father (god bless his heart he's the best and kindest father I could have wished for, despite him suffering a stroke and being 61 years old he still goes to work to support my unemployed ass and plans to keep working through retirement, though I want to cry every time I see how much he's struggling just to help me) to get perscription medication for ""himself"" but he gives it to me as he doesn't need it, he's a much stronger and kinder person than I could ever be. I also have a psychiatrist but I don't really tell him the truth, I just want to get the monthly perscription so I don't go into withdrawals. Currently I am using Tianeptine, Xanax, Stilnox (I believe it's called Ambien in the US, the active compound is zolpidem). 

Despite all the drugs I'm taking everything is just getting worse, I am incapable of functioning day to day, can't sleep at night I only sleep during the day which makes me feel even worse, I usually sleep from 10 AM to 4 PM and wake up with my stomach clenched from anxiety, vomit, spend an hour thinking about what a shitty decision it was to start using benzos in the first place and how my life was so happy before I had anxiety (started at about 17 years of age).

I started at a low dosage and after a year or so I got cut off because my then-psychiatrist thought I had been taking too much (she was right) though I managed to get clean after suffering the withdrawals, which weren't that bad at the time. I got clean. Then I started working at a call center for AT&T (I guess they outsource customer service to low income countries to cut the costs) and the stress made my anxiety come rushing straight back. The pay was pretty good (for eastern europe anyway) so I started to buy benzos off the street to cope with the stress, got fired anyway after about 4 months but I never stopped taking them after that.

I now feel my life is at a dead end and I can see no ""light at the end of the tunnel"". I consider suicide daily and feel like there is no future for me. I have been stuck in place for years now, I have not moved forward at all. Lost most of my friends, and the corona and the lockdown just made everything much worse.

Reading this, I can't help but think what a shitty and weak person I am, I am hurting my father (my mother cut me off from her life years ago in her eyes I'm just a junkie, she's also probably right), the only person that has stood beside me this whole time, while I should be the one supporting him by now. I have nothing but regrets, self-hatred and no self esteem to speak of.

I have done nothing with my life. I feel time passing me by, it seems like every year it goes faster and I'm scared of the future. I still care, I don't want to die, I just want the suffering to end.

I realize this was basically just a big stupid rant but I would be very grateful for any words of advice, support, encouragement. Anything. I am desperate, please help me, help me help myself.

"Thought I was an introvert, actually a depressed extrovert (help)",2,mlfrhx,0,"I've had depression and anxiety for 10+ years. Over the past year or so I've worked on taking control of the anxiety and I've recently pulled myself out of the depression. It's a lot to go into and it's all behind me now. I feel like myself again, but it's been too long since I've been myself and I'm struggling to find my place. I need people, but I have two friends. One of them is completely unavailable because she's dealing with her own crisis and the other isn't the going out type at all. I feel like I have no connection to the world and I don't know where to start. I'm ADHD so I'm always bored as it is and the pandemic isn't helping. I've had that ADHD brick-on-the-gas-pedal feeling for months but I'm not moving and I feel like I'm going to burn out. I just need one friend who knows their way around a bit so I can get my bearings and start meeting people on my own. Where do I start?"

I've had depression or maybe it's more of some existential dread (I believe that's the right term) for a long time now not because of covid or anything it's just my brain and how it works I also have adhd which i'm sure probably doesn't help but over the years i've noticed I was heading in a downward spiral in my life it's like i've just lost my meaning of life or like my will to live I also have noticed how shaky my hands are like I can't just SIT or stay still and keep my hands steady it's controllable but it's just something i've noticed about myself along with my immense indecisiveness. I just don't feel happy, sad, or, sympathy/empathy like i'm meh(ing) through my life like in a limbo hell of my own making I used to do all of my work and i'm not dumb i've just lost like my work ethic and I feel like i'm always behind and always having to catch up because I can't keep my work pace with people and I say I don't need help because I don't want to burden anyone and I know if I ask they'll just tell me that I need to actually do the work and In the end I just don't end up doing it out of laziness and the feeling that it doesn't matter. Honestly I don't know anymore and I don't know why I just can't fill this void or hole in my heart like a part of me is missing and I can't get it back. I've talked to therapist before but they haven't helped so instead I thought of seeking help from maybe like minded people"
I've been making the mistake of assuming that feeling okay is normal and misery is the deviation from normal that I have to work to get out of. Wrong. Misery is normal. Feeling okay is the deviation.,2,mlfj2p,1,"Stupid of me to hope that anything would be okay or work out for me or be easy.

I can't even get medicated because my healthcare system doesn't give a damn about mental health issues.

Problem with my parents and depression,1,mlf1kl,0,"Hey guys,

So I've always felt it. You know. Nothing was fun anymore, could never go to sleep because of those voices in your head, the works. Even as a child I faked the smiles so much I can even fool myself.

Here's some backstory: My parents adopted me from MI at about 10 days old. They were around 52-53 at the time and I was only 10d old (My birth mom was avid drug user of multiple drugs and I was experiencing side effects\[shaking, etc.\]). These people who adopted me are one of the families from the Detroit numbers running books in 1958. They set things up that I have told them multiple times I was not comfortable with, including trying to hook me up with someone without my knowledge or consent and burying my grandmother WITHOUT CLOTHES ON IN A CARDBOARD COFFIN. They did not notify me of her death or her burial. They also own a unlicensed gun (.42 shotgun) with several boxes of bullets.

Now, the depression has always been there. I have recently discovered my adoption records (the originals and the copies) in their possession as well as a copy of the birth record and doctors notes. It was written and underlined. Genetic 82/100 depression. I finally found out why I felt this way.

I brought up my depression with them and they did not even want to hear it, nor would they explain why they never took me to therapy so that I could feel better. They even went so far as to flat out deny I had had it and the past few years they have done nothing but mentally abuse me. My mom went so far as to be my supervisor's supervisor at my job to make sure I don't tell anyone else AND connected our bank accounts. Anytime I want to bring anything up now they cut me off. I almost didn't finish high school and I left college after a semester because it just overloaded me. I have problems concentrating and I can blank out for hours without realizing it. I have done things and made promises that I do not remember making. I am not sure if this is after effect of the above or if something else is wrong with me.

I'm so tired of it all. There was a scalpel that I hid somewhere in my room so that I won't get tempted. I never self harmed. I don't plan to. But those of you like me know when that quietness gets to loud how different you become. I want to use this kind of platform as a safe haven. If my friends so happen to be on the internet, so be it. Sometimes I might not post/reply for a while, though.

I don't want to be alone. but even right now as I'm typing this, my mind tells me that pushing others away is somehow saving them (?) Don't know what that means quite yet. But it feels a little better getting this stuff sorted out. Maybe somehow I can get right with my parents. Thanks for listening."
Loneliness is more than just being single,13,mlf172,6,"I’m 30 years old and feel like the older I get, the more disconnected from people I feel. Hanging out and talking to people doesn’t feel really fun as much. I don’t really have a sense of belong anywhere, childhood friends are all doing their own thing and the friends I made later in life feel transient. Everybody seems to have their established group n for me it’s trying to figure out how I can squeeze in. For some time being online on Twitter helped me find and make friends but now I feel even isolated there. Whenever the topic of being lonely as an adult comes up people assume it’s because I’m single. I have no problem trying to date and find somebody, but when I go on the apps, some people are very weird, clingy n gross for my liking lol....I just want somebody who’s fun to talk to and makes the mundane things in life more fun. I feel like that can be accomplished by so much more than just a romantic partner. Maybe it’s because I come from an immigrant background and my parents had huge communities and groups where families helped each other and other time it feels like we don’t have those bonds anymore. Sort of feels like the overworking/competition culture just makes it so hard to genuinely form bonds with others"
im so exhausted and I dont even know how to begin to feel better,2,mlf03v,0,"shit changed a lot recently, breakups are hard but this one happens to come with extra confusing fuckin baggage. Im so tired from thinking and being anxious and I end up too tired to get out of bed by just driving myself insane with trains of thought that lead no where. someone put me in a fucking coma already."
Family issues,1,mleuzv,0,"My father died of ALS last December, and it’s taken about every last toll on my mind leading up to it, anticipating the moment that I wouldn’t have a father anymore. Going through COVID, having to live on my own far away from him, not being able to talk to him... and not wanting to talk to him anyway. There was anger, guilt, sadness, all eating away at me and my life was already Hell as is, he was never there for me or my sister when we needed him most. And the news of him dying only made me feel more disconnected. He tried to re-enter our lives the year before in a last bid attempt to make up for lost time, but we were adults in our 20s by then. And then all this happened. Now we’re considered cursed by his family because we couldn’t drop our responsibilities and drive all the way up to New York to take care of him when it just simply wasn’t possible, how was I gonna take care of him when I didn’t even have the heart the talk to him.. My shitbag of an uncle also coerced him into re-writing most his will into his name and taking me and my sister out, out of spite for us since we weren’t there for him, even though he was, and still didn’t show up to take care of my father, he just wanted the money, the valuables. Makes me believe he never once gave a shit about him. Maybe I am an awful son for the way it ended, I think about my own life and who I am every day for it. But I don’t need to be told that by a vulture. I hope if my Dads somewhere that he can forgive me. Life has just not been easy, and sometimes I think of taking my life because of how awful it feels, and it doesn’t go away. I’m really just trying to get through all of this but I don’t have energy anymore."
I need some advise,1,mlek5e,1,"So, I've been struggling with some stuff for a bit now, and it's taken a massive hit on my mental health, and there's been some days where I don't get out of bed, and to eat and do everyday things, but I worry about my dental health, as I don't brush every day, so I was wondering if anyone has any advice?"
bruh fr,1,mlegz1,3,idk what to say i have adhd depression nervous breakdowns ptsd all that. i’m on anti depressants Kpin all that prescribed. idk what to do but lately past few months maybe i been feelin this rage and it comes out. i need to know if anybody else has ever dealt with this anger that comes from inside your chest and you gotta lash out even over the littlest things. always provoked. but sometimes even violently. which is what scares me. i just narrowly dodged prison before for a violent act and not trying to go. i don’t wanna hurt anybody who doesn’t deserve it. has anybody else ever dealt with this?
I can’t go home,1,mle9wp,8,I started a new job yesterday and quit today. I just can’t fucking handle it or myself. I can’t go home because I’m a failure of a human being who has no place in society. Idk where to go.
braindead for about a year now,2,mle914,0,"haven't learned anything in so long. just feel like my mind is so tired all the time. for the longest time i've just been filling my mind with garbage and just sort of living. i just hate myself so much, and i just wanna kill myself so bad. im just so lifeless and boring"
Should i end it because of vision loss?,1,mle3k3,11,"I dont think living blind is worth it, especially if you already have other disabilities.

Should i finally end it because of vision loss? Why should i keep going if i cant do anything anymore then?"
I just wasn't made for these times..,1,mle1eh,3,Anyone else ever feel like that?
New job blues,1,mle04g,2,"So some of you might remember my post about me kicking a hole in the wall the other day. I did lose the job. I was put on another post though. I’m in a weird mix of depression from hating it and trying to accept the consequences of my own actions. The new post I’m at is a huge commute and was less posh then I was at. I told my parents we lost the account, which we very well might, and I got put at a new place. They didn’t understand why I was so upset. Idk what to do. This is the best job I’ve ever had. Which is not a high bar. And I don’t think I’ll get one as good.

But one of the main reasons for posting this is that I feel like I need to stay here. To punish myself for messing up so bad and causing so much trouble for my company"
Freaking out,1,mldy0s,3,"It's currently 1:04am on a Wednesday and I just got back inside after talking to my mother. My mother can be stubborn and idiotic and her actions affect everyone, including me.

I asked my mother if she wanted to go out and get something to eat and she agreed. This was around 9-10pm, a few hours ago. I texted her and she didn't respond. I get worried very easily so I kind of just spammed here. I usually think irrationally and I can't really control it(?). Anyways, I figured that she must've been asleep after an hour and tried to get some sleep. Then she texted me.

She came over an hour after the text and I went downstairs. I realised that she was exhausted. She asked me if I wanted to drive (I don't even have my learner's licence) and I immediately refused. We got into the car and she kept falling asleep next to me.

I started freaking out and telling mum that I didn't wanna go and that she should just go home and sleep, that she was falling asleep at the wheel and it wasn't safe. She ignored me. She told me she wasn't even tired and like- I'm not an idiot.

After some arguing I told her I'm going back inside and she got upset, saying she wanted me to come and help her. She wanted me to tell her to slow down when she got too fast and keep her focused. I refused, and I feel like an idiot about it. I told her to go home before she ends up killing herself and walked inside.

I'm scared that's the last conversation I'm going to have with my mother. The last 'i love you'd I'll hear from here. Should I have gone with her and helped her? I feel awful for saying no.

I'm stressing out. I feel like crying. This isn't the first time this has happened either and I hate it."
Finally took the plunge and spoke to the doctor properly,3,mldtxw,0,"I have battled depression on and off for 2 years now, however I have always been able to control it until the last 6 months or so, it caused the breakdown of my marriage, and just over a month ago I tried to end my life, but thankfully called emergency services after a feeling of regret, fast forward a month and I spoke to the doctor today, she came up with a treatment plan which will include councilling and also 50mg of Sertaline daily.

&#x200B;

I really hope this is the start of finally getting myself back, after having this mental illness ruin so many peoples lives in my life, I finally want to feel better, it's going to be a long road from here and I know there's going to be many more downs on the way, but I just hope this is the start of my way out.

&#x200B;

No real point to this post, just wanted to write down this massive step I have taken today, it's haunted me for weeks since I tried to end my life, and I kept putting it off, but finally plucked up the courage this morning.

&#x200B;

Hope anyone else in my situation seeks help."
Why am I still alive?,3,mldshj,3,I feel like my presence is bugging everyone. They may not say it to be nice but I could feel it nonetheless. I have plans to commit suicide at a certain age anyway so I know I won’t be missed.

Who were you before the labels?,1,mldr37,3,"Who were you before people started to define you with labels? 
Who were you before you realized labels is how we identified ourselves from eachother?

Before labels defined who you were, you were your true self."
Meds,1,mldp6n,2,"I was on antidepressants for 5 years. It has now been 6 months without meds and I made it through a tough withdrawal phase. I decided to get off them to avoid relying on a substance which is changing the structure of my brain. Long-term, it’s not something that I want in my body. 

Naturally, my motivation is down and my depressive symptoms are back up. What are your experiences with how long it takes to return to a “baseline”? Or is this it...? Thanks."
I don't want to keep living this way,2,mldmsp,0,"But I don't know how to fix it. I can't get myself to do anything anymore. Too much anxiety, too much hopelessness."
Struggling with my wife understanding,1,mldmf5,0,"About 3.5 years ago we moved back to my hometown from Seattle which I really loved. Since moving back my depression has gotten much, much worse and I don't know how long I can keep living here.  I really just hate everything about here, but I digress.  

I had a memory on my Facebook page in Seattle where I looked happy and told my wife ""Look how happy I was"" and her response was ""well you thought about killing yourself in Seattle so you weren't that happy there anyways.""

I've struggled with depression since some traumatic stuff happened when I was a teen and have always had some type of occasional suicidal thoughts in the back of my mind that I work on blocking out and therapy to help. So yes, I did have those thoughts, but they were very infrequent and honestly I was the happiest I ever was. I still struggled with my darker thoughts and several months in a row where I would be really struggle with depression, but they were more infrequent and I was able to get back to a normal state quicker and was able to feel happy or at least content the other 8 months a year.

But being here has really put me in a spot where I'm struggling to even have one ""good"" day here where I don't feel like a mess and the infrequent bad thoughts I had are a way more common occurrence since moving here and it's been a struggle.  And it feels like she doesn't want or care to ask how I feel here because she likes it here. I'm just frustrated that if I ever bring up happy thoughts or times in Seattle she just talks about the times I wasn't and tries to get me to focus on that instead."
Finally getting around to creating a living will and it's eating me,1,mldkuv,0,"I don't know if this is the right place for this, so my apologies if it isn't, but I've finally decided to sit down and address my living will and I've realized that there isn't a single person in my life I feel safe or happy leaving guardianship of my young daughter to, and it's very disheartening, but more so it's eyeopening and it's now sitting on me like a ten ton brick. 

With COVID, being fairly isolated working from home, not being in physical contact with people I used to see daily, the loss of a relationship last year that really had me scrambling to stay functioning, and the sad realization that maybe this is all life has to offer is really making me feel like I'm experiencing some sort of depression. Not really outwardly, but within myself for sure. I've done the family doc thing, done the lab work to see if there's something there, exercised my butt off, lots of fresh air and sunshine, no luck.

I'm pretty successful, career-wise. I own a house and a car and all the toys I could want. I don't worry about money. I have quite a few friends and a lot of family who also don't really need to worry about money. These are reasons I question whether or not my post is appropriate for this sub, as I realize there are so many people out there less fortunate than I.

But I don't have a single person I want to list as my daughter's guardian in the even of both her mom (my ex, but friends) and I were to pass away. I have lots of friends with children, none of whom have parenting styles or family situations I would want my daughter to be saddled with. My sisters are in the same boat. Awesome people, love their kids to death, but not what I want my child living in or being raised in. The single person I'm close enough to that would undertake this responsibility is my own dad, and I'm hoping the situation never arises where I predecease my own parents. I had a pretty bad health situation ten years ago, which I've fully recovered from (as far as I, or any of my doctors know) and outside of that I'm healthy as I've ever been.

This is like peeling an onion, I think. The more I examine this, the more I feel like maybe I'm not where I wanted to be. Shouldn't I be surrounded with family and friends that are more like me? I don't feel my expectations are too high, as I know plenty of people who parent like I do and would do nearly as good a job at raising my daughter, but I'm not ""close"" enough with those people. Why are the ones I'm closest to so far from what I expect here? Why am I suddenly overcome with this internal panic over my own mortality and what I'd be leaving behind? How many people would even attend my funeral, let alone step in for my child? 

How do the rest of you deal with this hypothetical but certainly possible scenario? Should I be trying to redesign my life so that there are more people like this in it? Am I being unfair and demanding or judgemental? Any heartfelt, constructive advice would be appreciated.

End of first world problems rant."
"I think I’m going to lose my job, and I can’t find it in myself to fix the problem",2,mldhmp,0,"The last year and a half has been hell for me, as it has been for everyone, and I haven’t been taking it well at all. 

In November, my uncle died from complications of covid, and within a week I got it. It took nearly four months for me to start feeling okay again and I missed a lot of work in that time period and used up all of my paid leave. That meant that I was digging a hole financially. 

Since then my mental health has been in a downwards spiral to hell and I’m barely functioning at all, let alone at work. I miss so much work, and I don’t have the paid leave to back it up. My boss has been really patient with me, but I know he’s at his wits end and I keep having dreams that I lose my job.

I really don’t know what to do. I know the obvious answer is to suck it up and make it to work, but I can barely get myself to eat or move or shower. I know medication, therapy, just getting out of it, those are all answers, but they all take time and I don’t know how much I have until I’m out of a job."

How do I support a depressed friend without them feeling guilty or obligated to respond?,1,mlde4j,3,"So I strongly suspect one of my friends is depressed. We have kind of talked about it but he is never really that open about it. I love him to pieces and miss talking to him but don’t want him to feel guilty for not talking to me in return. 

I have anxiety and have also gone through some periods of depression in life. In response, I pushed away people. I wouldn’t respond and then I’d feel guilty for not responding to the point I never reinitiated conversation. I don’t want him to feel like I did but I want to give him support.

I heard that sometimes just having a reminder that you’re loved and have someone who will support you is important. I want to give that to him but don’t want him to feel obligated to respond, nor do I want him to feel guilty for not responding. I love him, that’s not going to change. 

How do I approach this?"
I need some fucking help,1,mldcj2,3,"1 year ago when I was 12 I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety followed by suicidal thought and self harm. A week ago I spent a week staying up late mentaly supporting a friend online to stop gim from killing himself only to find out he was goating me. Meanwhile over the past year or so my foster brither has shown a huge lack of motivation to go to school, work, or reqly anything, my mom has been lieing to my dad about this to keep him from kicking him out the house. Keeping a bug strain on her maridge. I cant keep up doing this shit I need fucking help"
"I just... I don't even know anymore. (13, he/they)",2,mlday2,3,"I haven't self-harmed in 1 month, 10days. (40 days).

But for some fucking reason, I have to hate myself in one way or another. Now I'm not eating... 


What the actual fuck is wrong with me."
Making myself cry during an orgasm makes it better ... (NSFW),10,mld5pz,3,"Sometimes when im in a deep depression, while I’m masturbating I’ll force myself to feel sad and when I cum (usually crying) it feels incredible. 
It’s so confusing- is depression and sexual pleasure somehow linked in my brain??
Does anyone else experience this, or has tried it?"
I feel like a husk of my former self,3,mld2z3,3,"What happened to me?, I used to be so much happier. I was an optimist, I was popular, people talked to me, I had friends, my grades were some of the best in the class, I used to have energy to run around for hours, my dental health was great, hearing was great, I was fiscally fit, I was creative and was motivated to write down my ideas, I used to be confident, I was so energized.

But now I'm just, tired all the time, I've had a creative block for months now, I'm a pessimist, I'm physically unfit, I constantly hear a ringing, my eyesight is getting blurry, I have cavities all over my teeth, I have no friends, nor anyone that I can talk too, my grades have dropped to mediocre.

I'm always so bitter, angry, resentful, too everyone because they have friends and good relationships.

I'm a hermit that barely talks or exits his room, my family refuses to accept that I'm the issue, constantly attempting to change my environment or take away privilege's.

I'm so alone in life, no friends, no significant other.

I have a father, a mother, and a  younger sister. I hate spending time with them as it is always an unpleasant experience. My mother holds my to an unbelievably high standard; anything other than a 94% is failure, my father constantly insults me, makes fun of me and refuses to even try to change and  my sister loves to get under my skin, on multiple occasions I've broken down because of her, she always has to be in the right and even when she does something wrong my parents lump me into it. I complain about it and I'm called selfish, and ignored.

My face in the mirror is so dead, and tired, to the point where sometimes I cant remember what it use don't look like.

Every relationship in my life has been ruined by me. My first ever friend?, cant remember their name, elementary friends?, dumped them to hang out with the popular kids, the popular kids?, when they went away from the school I just stopped communicating, My old elementary friends?, also recently went away to another school and I cant bring myself to talk to them.

In a span of a 3 year I've lost my friends twice, had 2 of my dogs die, tried to kill myself 3 times, I've destroyed my family relationship, ruined my school life, and I am slowly rotting away.

I just feel so alone, and nothing in my life bring me pleasure anymore, its just the same repeating boring cycle everyday.

I  wish I could just go back, to times before.

I'm sorry to anyone reading this, I just wanted to vent a little and I'm not the best at writing comprehensibly ."
I can’t focus on anything,2,mlcyre,2,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit, I don’t even know if I have depression, but the point is that I constantly have thoughts about self harm or suicide and I can’t fucking concentrate on anything. I have so much homework for this week and I haven’t done shit because I feel terrible and everything is too difficult and drains too much energy, so I’d rather spend all my time scrolling mindlessly on social medias. I’ve always been the kind of student that does all their homework and always succeeds, but during the last months I’ve lost all my motivation, passion and strength, I seriously don’t know what to do, bad grades scare me, but at the same time I’m mentally and physically unable to do anything."
Is there a support group that holds regular discussion or something?,1,mlcvjn,1,"This pandemic has taken a serious toll on my mental health. I find myself dealing with difficult feelings every waking hour. I don't have a single friend in real life to talk to.  I have no one to look up to. While I do have online friends, my interaction with them is very rare.

I was wondering if there was some kind of a serious support group (free of cost of course) that holds regular ""round table"" sessions where people talk about and listen to how/what each other feels. I have seen something like this only in movies and tv shows. Maybe there is one in real life that is online and open for anyone in the world?

I don't want to be believe I am really all alone :`-("
What does it feel like to be told you're beautiful? To hear the words 'I Love You'?,91,mlctpu,43,"It is the deepest hope and desire of my heart and soul that one day I will hear these words, but I know I never will. As a teenager everybody said ""well you have your whole life ahead of you"", ""don't rush it"", ""you'll find somebody some day""... the usual clichés.

Well, now here I am pushing 40 and I am no closer to finding love now than I was when I was 16.

My heart is empty. It is broken. I feel worthless. I am so empty, and broken. All I want in this life is to be loved. I want to be somebody's everything. And I just don't know what it feels like. I won't lie... I get jealous when I see others loving on each other. I'm happy people have been able to find love. They're so lucky.

But what is it about me? My family tells me I'm beautiful. But they're all lying. If I am really beautiful, why doesn't anybody else- who isn't family- see it? If I was beautiful, wouldn't a guy have approached me by now to ask me out?

And before anybody says ""maybe they're intimidated""- that's not the case at all. I literally have a 100% track record of rejection. I have lots of guy friends, and I've even developed a crush on a few of them. But as soon as I say ""hey, I like you- want to hang out/go to the movies/grab dinner sometime?"" they immediately turn on me and not only do I get rejected, the friendship dissolves.

I just don't understand. There's something wrong with me that I don't see and nobody will tell me what it is. Am I really not that pretty? Am I really that ugly nobody wants to give me a chance?

I just want to be loved."
Nobody ever takes me seriously and I'm always right..its like a curse,1,mlcto9,8,"Friends family doctors nobody ever listens to me and I'm sick of it I really am its like everyone ignores me nobody wants to hear what im tryna say and then are shook when what I said will happen, happens. And it's even more annoying bc then there like I wish I listened to u fuck off you've done it so many times. 
This is more about the doctors I've been telling them for 5 years about my period problems and it's like they never took me seriously I've never had a consistent period. 
I told my mother and friends its going to be pcos and everyone was acting like im being horrible and it wouldn't like huh.
Ofcourse today the doctor came and confirmed that i have polycystic ovary syndrome 
And like yea tru they wouldn't have been able to cure me or whatever but u know what it would have been better to know or to feel like there were fucking listening to my health concerns rather than treating me like a mad woman and making me feel like I was invalid bc I was worrying over it."

I've been abused literally for my whole life with my sibling and my mother but my dad and me are extremely close to moving far away. I also have an eating disorder and have been struggling and they keep triggering my ED with the bullshit they say. I don't know how long I can handle this because i'm so close to freedom yet it feels so far away. Really i literally have nothing to do every single day except working out.

Does it really get better,18,mlcjys,5,"Does life ever really get better, cause i have honestly heard the same quote "" life gets better"" from every single person in my life and it just never does. Whenever i get a glimpse of hope that things will be fine something always destroys that. I am just mentally physically exhausted of every single thing. The worst thing is i have no fucking idea why am i so messed up i get traumatized over shit ppl get over so easily. I hate the way i look, i feel, the way i sound, i hate the way my brain functions. I just want to feel alive again."
There’s 7 billion people on Earth and non of them love me.,18,mlciob,3,"That’s all I really have to say, and it sucks. I’ve felt alone for over 5 years and nobody irl cares.

I doubt I’ll even get to have a kid, I don’t think anybody would want me as a father"
I wonder how it feels like to borned good looking/rich,9,mlchh9,1,"Lets face it. Looks and money are everything. Everything is so easy when you are goodlooking or rich. More friends, more respect, more girls, even the probability of getting a job is higher if you are good looking, in fact not just a job but getting what you want. Im sick and tired of seeing kpop stars and rich and good looking people posting and crying on social media 'im so depressed' bs. You dont know what its like to be at the bottom to be like us. If my life was like theirs, i would never ever get depressed."

I see all the problems i caused because i just wanted someone to talk to, i was alone and felt u could understand, but in the end. Like everything in my life that attracts rotten luck. I ran u away, i see all the mistakes I've make, i see what i took for granted, and for that. Maybe i deserve to be alone, because no matter how hard i try i always fuck up in life. I see that instead of relying on u for happiness, i could've make myself happy, but i was alone for so long that i didn't know what to feel, how to feel. Emotionally i was confused about u. But in the end i realized it doesn't really matter because I Am the one to blame."
Bad anniversary...,2,mlcav2,0,"It's been two years since I found out I was pregnant and then made to starve myself and kill my unborn baby. I hate myself everyday for what I was made to do.

Realizing you were the wrong one all along fucking hurts.,2,mlc976,0,"Why the hell it had to take me so long to figure this shit out, why? Every friend I lost, every person that I got intimate with and lost. I PUSHED THEM AWAY, in my mind it was their fault, it was how they treated me, but no, it was fucking mine. I was the one that got snippy, I was the one that closed myself, that let my insecurities control my actions, I was the one that was always fucking up everything. No wonder people left me, I am fucking worthless, a terrible friend and an awful person.

And you know what the best part is? The part that got me laughing today? I can't fucking change this, I always fuck up somehow, I am one poor excuse of a human being and I will always be, some people just deserve to be alone, to be locked away and forgotten, and I am one of those people."

Feelings of guilt around depressed partner,2,mlc6yb,0,"Hi all,

My girlfriend has been depressed for about 6 months, a mixture of living alone, covid, and not feeling fulfilled in her job has left her feeling isolated and depressed. We are also in a 2000+ mile long distance relationship and see eachother about every 6 weeks for a few days at a time.

I've recently been struggling with feeling interested in the relationship and I feel so guilty for that. Almost every phone call feels exhausting and draining for me as I try to make conversation and receive very short answers, it's like she's totally checked out. She is trying to find help but struggling to do so for insurance reasons etc. She often describes feeling incredibly anxious and sad. I really do try my best to be there for her, and I'm worried because I can feel myself losing interest. She isn't the girl I fell in love with anymore.

I want to be there and continue to support her through this, but at times it feels very hard and like I'm forcing myself to.

I don't want to bring this up and add to her emotional state, I know she is already aware of this at some level and feels bad enough.

Has anyone else been on either side of a similar situation?

Thanks for reading, have a great day!"

I’m trying my best but slowly I feel myself slipping away. It sucks because I shouldn’t feel like dying when I’m right next to my daughter. My girl tells me she loves me but I don’t feel the love.. I’m trying my best by talking to my family about what’s going on but they act like it’s nothing or I’m just talking crazy until I lose my temper.. I hate that, they mean the world to me but yet I feel like they don’t care about me til I give something... prison opened up my eyes on who would really be there or who would pick up the phone.. I was locked up not for too long, but that whole time I didn’t receive one letter and the only one that picked up was my best friend. It hurts cause what if I was dead, how quick would it be for them to forget me.. it hurts because even when they were in the hospital, like my grandmother for example, I was the first one there. While everyone else didn’t even bother coming up.... depression runs on my mom side of the family and my dad has anxiety, so I know what to do when I have either one but it’s been getting to me lately and I’m scared.. I don’t wanna do anything that’ll make me lose my family.... I just wanna be okay again... and again I’m sorry for this post but I don’t know what to do anymore...

How does one *qualify* to have depression?,32,mlbn8c,19,"I tried talking to my family about my depression but was simply cut off by "" You haven't even experienced what life is, how would you know? I should be more depressed than you considering what I've been through.""

I've then approached my college's psychological counselor as I couldn't afford one outside. She thinks my depression is linked to my performance in academics. And she hasn't replied since.

If I commit suicide will I be finally qualified depressed? I don't have the courage to do so, will that mean I am a terrible piece of useless shit of failure? I'm pretty sure I m even more pathetic."

It's getting bad again,2,mlbgzv,4,"People say I always think of the worst case scenario, but in my life that usually seems to be what  happens. I try to think things are going well and will turn out fine and it all blows up in my face. It all goes wrong. I keep letting myself try to think positively but every time I get knocked down again. Every kick in the teeth hurts more than the last.

I can keep trying to delude myself that I mean anything to them, that I mean anything to anyone. Keep trying to convince myself and believe that I am deserving of love, that they might change their mind and love me again, that anyone could ever love me.

I didn't even deserve them before and I am even less deserving now. They always shined in comparison to me but now they are the sun compared to my dying flashlight glow. A glow that dims more every day. Paling as I disappear while you only grow brighter, eventually my light will go all the way out and I will be gone. 

Until then I will just keep going through the motions, living inside my delusional mind, revisiting the times when everything didn't feel like this, even just for a moment. Fighting against the shadows inside my own head that threaten to extinguish the light faster still than it was already fading."

My life isn't even that bad. I don't have any trauma, understanding parents, and a decent financial situation. So why do I feel like killing myself. It makes me feel as if im sad for stupid reasons.

What should I say to someone suicidal who Is denying all help,1,mlakuo,5,"I've been following someone on reddit for a while now and I recently found out she's depressed and also struggles with an eating disorder.

Secretly I was hoping to get kidnapped or hit by a car. I didn't even care if I died or not. Then when I was coming back home I had the strongest urge just to keep going straight and right into the highway. I didn't, but who knows maybe next time I don't stop. I really want to tell them what's going on, but is so hard too. I told my dad that's I'm feeling worse than when I started meds and stuff, I just didn't say how bad it really is. I don't know how the hell I'm going to get through this. I have this sick combo of PTSD, ADHD, anxiety, and depression. Its causes a cycle of me getting no sleep, then being super frustrated, not wanting to do schoolwork so I just don't do it, getting even more frustrated, super bad headaches, then I either somehow getting better or I get mad at myself for being frustrated and then cry because I probably hit my cat or yelled at my friends.

I am struggling to cope. I don't see much of a way out anymore.,2,mlag9q,0,"I'm tired of fighting. I feel very stuck due to my mental health and don't see much of a way out anymore. I don't want to tell any friends/family because I am ashamed and don't want them worrying anymore.

I am 26. I was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder at around 14 after a trauma, and have constantly struggled with it ever since. I also have ASD. That's half my life of the same bs. No matter what I do, nothing gets any better for long, despite supportive people and so many great steps that I have made. I am tired of fighting.

I've seen two psychologists since I was a teenager who helped me manage and become not only very emotionally intelligent but also functional in day-to-day life, through CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, etc. I even had a period about 2.5 years ago of around 6 months of actual happiness and bliss in my life. But my mental health rollercoaster never stays in one position for long.

I've tried so many different medications and dosages (my GP is great and supportive). Some work a little bit for a time. Others don't. Most give me dreadful side effects. I have functional, healthy relationships, two parttime jobs I enjoy, friends, a decent diet, etc. There is no clear reason why I should be feeling how I do.

Yet over the last 9 months I have slipped again and it's gotten to the point where I am feeling exhausted with it all. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm on repeat, enjoying nothing, only getting up because I have to. I drive to work and dissociate, fantasising about accelerating into a powerpole. I don't want to tell my family/friends anymore because I just feel like a broken record on repeat. 

I can't afford to see my psychologist or a psychiatrist (even with the referrals that I do have) because I don't work long hours due to my mental health (I get very fatigued very fast). My medication is expensive too. I now struggle getting up each day, being bothered to shower, or even eat. 

This time is different. I've had heaps of absolute worst low moments, where I'm emotionally distraught for months on end. This time I'm just hopeless and exhausted. I don't see a fix. I don't want to ask for financial help because I feel ashamed to. I feel like asking for help is implying that I think my money is more important than my family's money. I feel stuck and needed somewhere to vent because I'm not aure what more I can do, so thanks for reading and letting me get all this out."
How to help a friend,1,mlafqs,5,"A good friend of mine recently told me that they are struggling and I just wanted to know if there was any ways I could help them

They explained how daily tasks have become difficult for them, as things like work, eating, showering, and things like that make her angry and upset as she doesn't view them as worth it. This is because shes been struggling recently, both in college and life in general, and these daily tasks and schoolwork don't seem worth it as she's not enjoying life. She also said how she know she's not doing her best at life but also doesn't want to try harder.

Therapy is not an option for her due to external circumstances, and I wanted to know if there is anything I could do or say to help her. I tried my best to be supportive but I feel like I could do a better job with your input. Thank you."
What happens when you hardly physically socialize with people for more than year?,1,mlabxj,0,"Hello guys. I don't mean to pester anyone. But I really wanted to know what happens to you physically and mentally if you hardly socialize for more than a year.

Back story: I have been fucked mentally for more than year now. I got diagnosed with dysthemia and bipolar. In between it got a little better last year but then lately for the past few months, it's been very hard to deal with the depression. It's literally putting me on the edge and I feel suicidal almost everyday. Although I know I will never act on the suicidal fantasies. It has made me more reserved and asocial. I have hardly socialised for around a year and few months. I know I should, but I just find it in me. I just wanted to be sure that it won't be having any long-term health effects."

I apologized and let him retake his position, but he just yelled at me to pay attention in a cold, authoritative voice that‘s still ringing in my ears hours later. It took all my might to not wilt to the floor right then and there, and now I’m in my room unable to read or write or do anything I wanted to do today. I feel like a miserable waste and a pathetic, stupid person. I already know I’m going to stay this way for a while.
      
         
I hate myself. I hate that I get this way and I hate how much little moments like this hurt me. I wish I could stop the impact it has on me, but I can’t no matter how hard I try. I’m 22 years old and here I am just wanting to cry. Why do I have to get like this? Does anyone else felt the same way?

Also I apologize for the grammar and structure of this post. I’m a mess right now and this was done on my phone."
Do I tell my friends I’m depressed?,1,ml9woi,5,I just feel like I can’t tell them I’m depressed because it just feels taboo ish to talk about. Idk how to explain it. I feel like they kinda  already know based on me talking about myself and my past but i just feel like actually saying it makes it more weird.
uh what is this really? 15 year old male,3,ml9v1t,1,"For the past week or so i once more started feeling weird, it is a kind of sadness but isn't as nothing that i experienced before, i still can socialize and do stuff but everything i do becomes meaningless to me is as if i'm not really in here but pretending to be and i can do that perfectly apparently as nobody noticed that i am feeling like this, i want to talk to friends and family but something is preventing me from doing it. I had this 'moments' i guess once every two months? i can say with certain that i had a  similar feeling mid 2020, it was horrible, i hadn't any courage to do the simpler of things nor i had any joy in doing everyday stuff. Apart from now and as mentioned mid 2020 when i had it just was some intrusive thought or another, i have Maladaptive Daydreaming so perhaps there is a correlation to that now i'm feeling with doubt about happiness, something in my head keep saying that i'm not happy since long ago."
if my problems are all from my living arrangement.....,1,ml9rxu,0,I have to leave right? If staying makes me want to kill myself I have to just go right?
My brain is falling apart,1,ml9rfw,0,I used to be cold headed and could logically think and get an answer which was most of the time correct. I am actually becoming more stupid and hot headed. I cannot think straight for more than a moment. And with each mistake I make I fall apart for the rest of the day. I am depressed for a while now but I didn't feel this way. Now that I am in collage I am literally falling apart under the burden of thought that I am not smart enough anymore.
Just a vent,1,ml9mix,1,"I don’t know what to do with my life. We just went back to physical school and I hate it so much, I have barely 3 friends and I’m not even really close with them. I feel like they are with me just because they have no one else to be with between classes. And I do the same. I’m really socially anxious and I can’t speak confidently even with my friends.
I get anxious in classes and uncomfortable and I can’t concentrate and understand simple tasks, I really feel like my brain isn’t working the same as before.

Besides school, I feel like no one actually cares about me. I used to have a really deep connection with my best friend and I don’t feel that anymore with her, I feel like I burden her and ruin her mood every time I try to vent to her (she said that as well) but I don’t know what to do other than that cause I don’t have anyone else I can talk to. I used to feel like she was always there for me and she always said the right thing and made me feel better. But now it’s not the same and I tried to talk to her about it but not much has changed. 

My mom triggers me all the time by saying things about suicide and depression as if it’s nothing serious, and she knows I’m depressed. 

Also summer is coming and people in my school already wear short sleeves and I’m so terrified of the thought of having to show my scars. Makeup wouldn’t hide all of them and neither bracelets cause the scars are all over my arm and some of them are raised. I don’t know what to do I can’t just wear long sleeves all summer. I live in a very hot country. The weirdest part about it is that I don’t even regret having those scars.

I just feel like I’ve had enough. Even if I’m going to have some good experiences in my future, I don’t believe it will ever be worth it. I really don’t want to keep going to school and study so hard just to be able to have a boring job eventually. I hate everything about how this world works and I’m only here because I don’t want to make anyone sad. I wish I never existed in the first place."
Incredibly down.,2,ml9kdr,0,"
From a high paying, high alert job to struggling in the 1 year lockdown. Thinking of giving up my 8 dogs whom Ive cared for so much in 6 - 2 years. Recently quit a job due to toxic boss as i am the manager of the team, teammates felt were being attacked unnecessarily. In January, fixed my dad’s problems and he ended up leaving my rented apartment due to sadness at home. 350 + job applications passing interviews but only three great job offers that did not push thru. Was offered a best position by a controversial politician but my morals dont align. Now, i suffer. Too much pride? Must be my line of work and the values it taught me. Must be over caring for people and not leaving something for myself. Must be too much idealism. I got depressed, went to therapy the whole lockdown. Sought only close family member I have but I think hed like for me to figure things out on my own. Planned to use my savings in my masters studies but ended up in the pandemic cage. Worst time to be alive. Sometimes i think of just resetting life and leaving this world. Writing here seems to be the only safe space. To everyone reading, thank you in advance for any thoughts. Let’s all take care."
What do you do on the days it's impossible to enjoy anything,1,ml9jqr,3,I feel terrible at least a little all the time but some days or weeks or months it's just impossible to enjoy anything or be happy or even just feel neutral. The worst part is I can always feel it coming before it happens but there's nothing I can do to stop it and I've tried everything I can think of. The normal advice is just do things you enjoy or talk to people and I try that but I just end up feeling worse somehow. I want to enjoy something even a little or just be distracted from this feeling but nothing works and I feel trapped. Do I really just have to wait it out every time? The time I get between these moments is getting thinner and thinner and the time this despair lasts is getting longer and I don't know how much more I can take. I've been successfully distracting myself for years and I'm sure I could a few more but I don't even know what the point is anymore.
Something feels really wrong,1,ml9jah,1,"For the past couple nights I’ve been hysterically crying over the mess I’ve created with my life. I mean my life’s always been a mess but lately it feels so much more intense and is making me so emotional. 

I keep praying but I really don’t know if anyone is listening anymore so that feels really unsettling as someone who refuses to doubt there’s a higher power who can hear me. 

BUT besides that, for two nights in a row I’ve been trying to vent and open up to my best friend and both instances I get ignored. The first time it was an hour. Then tonight it was all night and still no response. I get it, people aren’t always available but it’s really really really strange to me because she’s ALWAYS up at night. At first I think she is mad at me for something but in my text last night I quit literally begged her and told her I really need someone to talk to. I had running thoughts all night and couldn’t sleep because I wondered why she wouldn’t answer. The same thoughts repeated over and over and over. I turned my notifications off so I could try to sleep and not care if she replied because I realized she probably wouldn’t. But it’s really unusual that she didn’t. 

I’ve messaged various people and get no reply. It’s just WEIRD. 

Not a single person is listening. And I’m trying to prepare for work today and then get my school work done after (I’m in college) but I think it’s going to be a mess. I keep being on the verge of tears and I won’t stop thinking about how abandoned I feel. 

To try to sleep last night I really tried to think of things that are positive but all those turned so negative. And it was really hot in my room. It’s just a mess and I’m trying really hard to find a reason for why I feel so wrong."
I feel hopeless and I need some help.,2,ml9d9p,0,"i live a pretty average life—better than most actually. but honestly? i’m so tired of everything and especially myself. i live life through escapism as it’s the only thing that really makes me feel anything. i’ll watch anime or read, and maybe i’ll laugh, i’ll smile, and feel good, but without it i feel almost empty. everyday feels so hopeless—everything feels like a struggle. i get anxious over the future often and fret about what i have and haven’t done. i often feel as if i’m failing or am a failure despite the fact that i haven’t really failed. i sometimes have this physical weight on my chest because of how useless i think i am.

despite my circumstances i feel as if i can’t turn to anyone. my father and i have a terrible relationship, and i don’t want to burden my already struggling mother. i don’t feel like any of my friends would care to understand, nor would they know what to say. i don’t feel like i have any relationships meaningful enough for this. 

often times i’ll even invalidate my own feelings and will convince myself i’m doing this for attention. despite the fact that no one really knows. and this feeling of irrational guilt makes me feel worse. i’ll even have a difficult time falling asleep.

i’m only 17 but i feel as if i’m crumbling. i don’t want to die, but i don’t want to be burdened with existence. i know that i should be lucky, i’m alive and well. that i’m privileged enough to make a post on here. but i’m truly so tired. please help me i don’t understand"
It's all coming back,1,ml9anm,1,I have to go to school tomorrow and my anxiety and depression are returning. I was in relative peace for 2 weeks but now my anxiety is back I guess
TW: Has a family member/some one close to you told you your depression makes them walk on egg shells around you?,2,ml988z,2,"TRIGGER WARNING AHEAD:

Ijust got into a huge fight with my sister over something small and she revealed that he finally had enough of my depression and her walking on eggshells around me. I barely talk to her because she’s always stressed 

from work, and I never share my depression problems with her because she once blamed me for making our mom cry over attempted suicide (yes, she said that to me weeks after my recovery in the hospital) 

I honestly feel so hurt how my own sister could say those things about me, especially coming from my own blood.

I just need some sort of validation or comfort here I guess because my family seems to outcast me more that I’m living with depression and it’s honestly triggering me to hurt myself again because I feel more useless and burdensome to them."
I was raised by a narcissistic parent. [VENTING],1,ml9542,3,"And the other day she came up to me and essentially was asking me why I'm so miserable all the time. And asked THAT question we all never wanna hear. ""why can't you just be happy"". But she doesn't want me to be happy for me. She wants me to be happy so I'll talk to her more. I just love how she makes my issues a problem because of what she wants for herself. I haven't even been able to treat my depression with meds even though I'm 23 bc I'm afraid she'll go into my room and take them and throw them out. And then her excuse would be ""well you're on my insurance so I can do whatever I want"".

Real talk. I was doing better until she came up to me that day. Feeling like a little down and slow and not talkative because works been hard lately. She got mad at me for not talking to her enough. But that's literally what I try to do. I try to avoid contact with her because I know everything she says to me is to try and control me and to get me to do stuff for her when all she is is rude and condescending to me. She tells me my depression isnt real. And that shit just fucking pisses me off. I've been dealing with depression for a long time. Like 10 years but on and off. And ik that seems like a long time but it's because I was on drugs. I'm clean now but it's hard to get better when the people who are supposed to be your support system just make you feel like shit and invalidate your feelings. Ik this post is a bit all over the place I just needed to vent all this stuff lol.

Also just remembered that literally 5 minutes after we had this big pissing match she came up again to show me a letter someone wrote to her at her job praising her. She knew I was upset. I can't ever hold back my tears im a baby lol. But just wanted to talk about herself of course. She has a ridiculously big ego. Which maybe for some is fine. But she's a narcissist.

Last thing I'll talk about which was the hardest thing of our fight. She makes me feel like I'm fucking up. And like I'm irresponsible when I'm not. There was an issue with my car payment and she saw a letter from the car company (WITH MY NAME ON IT) opened my mail and said the letter said there wasn't enough money to complete the transaction. Which was bs because there was. It turned out at be an issue with them having the wrong account shit. But whatever lol. She then went on to tell me how my sister never did shit like this. She always did everything right. Like. Dude.. I'm sober. Working a good job. Doing all the right things! I'm just trying to do stuff for myself rn. As in my mental health. And I feel like I can't with her in my life cause all she ever does is shove my successful sisters life in my face by comparing me to her. And making me constantly feel like my feelings are invalid. And making me feel like everything I'm doing isn't enough.

OK. I have finished my. Venting. If you read this thank you 🖤"
How do i live with myself?,2,ml92y4,5,I ruin everything i touch..over the past few years I've ruined every relation i had with people..over the past few years I've gotten so lonely that i look around and there's nothing but Darkness..i stopped making friends or developing relations with people as i was afraid that I'd get more hurt but now the loneliness hurts a lot i feel this was stupid but when you trust people so much and they break your trust you don't really go back to them... I've anxiety im insecure about so many things i simply cant live with myself even for a minute without worrying about the people I've left in my life... I've chestpains and i cry almost on a daily basis now..idk where i went wrong but i feel there's no more path for me to walk on...i guess the path i took was just a dead end and I've reached my end here..
weight and appetite loss on sertraline,1,ml924m,1,"ive been on sertraline for about a month now, my dosage is 50mg and i feel like my depression is pretty much cured. however ive been losing tons of weight, i had decreased appetite during my worst depression phase and its still the same. so ive had continuous weight loss for a few months now, in total ive lost about 30lbs. since my doctor put me on sertraline ive lost around 8lbs. food just doesnt taste that good and im completely ok with not eating for an entire day, but i force myself to eat. i just have no desire for food, and i just wanna know if anyone else experienced this? and does it go away? if i stop taking sertraline are there withdrawal symptoms like weight gain?"

Everyday it gets harder to get up,82,ml8tjs,4,"I just couldn’t see the point in trying anymore. Why would I, when everything that comes my way are just endless problems? I feel so lonely and unmotivated. Just today I could’ve caught up with my school deadlines but instead, I ended up just sleeping all day because at least I’m a little bit happier in my dreams. Every time I think of opening my laptop to start working, I get so anxious, which ends up with me just procrastinating more while feeling more and more useless. Another is that ever since I started losing my “mask” and began telling my close friends how sad I am, it seems like they’ve been ignoring or distancing from me. Not a single one of them has asked how I’m doing or what’s happening to me as if we weren’t even friends at all and it hurts so much. I had been there for them but now that I needed them, they’re acting like I’m a plague to be avoided. I just want things to be the way they were before...."
I don’t know who I am,2,ml8pjz,1,"I don’t know who I am anymore.

I was already lost but now I have no purpose. 

I didn’t think I’d be alive this long. I didn’t think I’d have to get a real job, do proper adult things, see my siblings all reach their mid twenties. 

What do you do when you realise you’ve reached further than you ever thought you could and the only thing I was ever good at is totally void now?

Why didn't I talk to you sooner. Why did I wait before it was to late. Why can't I change everything and have made everything right. I should have I could have I would have. But I didn't. I can't talk about you to my other friends. It hurts to much. They don't understand. They won't understand. The pain of losing someone doesn't go away. The guilt slowly kills you in side.

I just want to end this vicious cycle,3,ml8h5j,1,"

I’ve been trying to fix my shit for five years.
I’ve been to numerous psychiatrists who never understood. I never got a proper diagnosis. 

2 weeks ago I decided to give it another shot and get diagnosed, I was prescribed a medication and when I took it, it was the worst night in my life. I literally couldn’t breathe, my blood pressure dropped and I was unable to move and I felt so cold. I wished to die for the pain to end. I contacted my psychiatrist and told him but he just told me to lower the dose...
Bitch I was literally dying, I shouldn’t even take 1/2 a pill again. 

I don’t feel like I want to try again. I just want to be done. This is too much shame, guilt and pain and I really want some peace just for a month

I never had a full month without being shamed, without depression or any problem with my dickhead father who threatens to kill me..


I just want to die. I really do. I’m just so squeamish and timid to do anything.."
I Lost All of my Motivation. Missing The Pain,3,ml8gw7,0,"I realize now that I never really had much motivation to do anything in my life. Maybe it’s because I was spoiled as a kid but in 11th grade I asked my grandma to give me pills so that I could force myself to focus in 12th grade since I knew it would be extremely busy and in 11th grade I barely had any homework but some days was still stressed. 

There’s always been something wrong with me. I think I’ve realized that since as early as 3rd grade. I’m different... maybe I’d hide it behind me being a nerdy kid but no... something was off. And my moms side of the family has a mental illness that comes through the family. But she’s adopted and I’ve roughly noticed every member of my moms side of the family is off to some degree... most at least. 

Going into 12th grade I was even more busier than I originally thought I’d be. But I managed everything AMAZINGLY the first 3 months. I did everything I was supposed to do and if I had kept going would’ve probably gotten into a top tier school and gotten amazing grades. 

But at this point in my life I downloaded an app. This app was a social network. I made many friends on it was apart of many groups and it controlled my day to day life. I would talk in class outside of class all day every day I was addicted. I remember being able to last hours just communicating to people. 

However, things ended HORRIBLY. Idk if it was my illness that made me mess things up or if it’s all in my head and they were the reason. But I’ve realized that if I get a shit ton of friends and all end horribly that to some degree it’s probably my fault. Idk if this was the trigger to losing all my motivation but I remember one day studying for my SAT and then just getting a huge trigger not an anxiety attack but just pains in my head and Body. 

After this event I was done for. I think a huge part of this is the psychological effects that app and those people had on me whether it was my fault or not. To this day I feel I’m hiding myself to some degree to fully realizing what happened and blocking myself from the pain. But ever since then I’ve had no motivation. 

I work 3 days a week 10 hours maximum this job similarly to the school thing is starting to impact my mind in negative ways. I feel that same pain in my head and stomach and it scares me because if I have a similar event to what happened in school I’m afraid I’ll make myself even worse than before.

I wanted to quit but my family said Dont because 1 it will be hard to find another job after quitting and 2 I can’t stay there without a job. There’s so much going on why can’t I just take a few months to refresh my brain?? At the point I’m going I’m going to crash. 

I read an article and apparently they say it’s not being unmotivated or lazy but it’s fear. And I’ve realized that’s the exact feeling I feel. I can’t dedicate long periods of time doing specific things because it scares me as if I’ll somehow miss out on something or like I have something to do very very soon that’s impacting that event. Because of this it’s effected even some hobbies like video games. I can’t dedicate long periods to one game or ill get bored or anxious. 

But after reading this I feel better knowing it’s just fear. I do think at times it is pure boredom. I feel I’ll enjoy myself doing something else than what I’m doing but other times it’s definitely fear. The impact of these events are rooted deeply inside of me. These events started in 2017 and ended in 2019. And they are still effecting me and there... I just refuse to think about it and claim I’ve moved on when infact I’m just hiding it. Sometimes I remember old things and part of me longs for that pain again.... 

I want to return to those days they sucked but I felt alive... sometimes I think about going back to the app and trying to find all the old people but i realize it’s been soo long they’ve probably forgotten about me or don’t have the app anymore. Or stuff will happen again that will trigger me even more and fuck me up. 

I think about the fact that this is probably holding me back and I need to accept what happened except for denying it and move on but when I think about doing that my brain hurts. I feel these events were so important yet they weren’t. They took place online entirely and were just random people but my brain is convinced it is EVERYTHING and the more time passes the worse it gets because I realize how much I fucked up and miss those days so much."
16-hour naps,6,ml8ejm,1,"I just woke up and I feel like shit. I don't mean to sleep for so long but it's just so nice taking a break from my life. Though the dreams that come with my sleeping habits are not my favorite, just passing through time without any awareness makes me so happy. I know it sounds cheesy, but if I could do this with my lover I think I'd never wake up. I just get so tired of being on the edge and being alone and having my flashbacks that sleeping just seems like the best way out of it. However, the consequences when I wake up are terrible (Empty tummy, raging headache, worried lover, and worried parents). Despite that, I still enjoy my 16-hour naps."
How to remission?,2,ml8bet,0," TLDR at the end

I'm depressed, have been for a long time. I was verbally abused as a child, and forced to work since i was very young. My family used me to vent their frustrations. I wasn't allowed to go out as a teenager, and on the rare occasion i had to call my parents every hour. 

I was kicked out at 18 but it was okay. My friend taught me how to get a job, a bank account, a cellphone, how to enrol to college. Without her i wouldn't be here. 

I realized something was wrong with me early on, but i didn't know what. It wasn't until my panic attacks became daily that i decided to get medical and psychological help. (thank u healthcare) 

I have been on treatment for around 4 months. 
Its hard. I have opened pandora's box and i cant close it, everything just keeps pouring out. 
Before medication the problem was the anxiety, the low self esteem, the inability to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
During treatment, now i have to deal with the pressure of ""working on it"", of pushing forward to get better. But if i was able to push forward, then i wouldn't have depression, right? 

Medications don't work... prozac makes me so anxious and violent... i started cutting. 
New medication makes me tired and numb.. i still want to cut.... i cant sleep without pills... i have nightmares either way. I can't eat because im worried i'll gain weight... my head hurts. I have moods wings and i'm isolating from everyone. 

My psychologist told me to concentrate on doing things that make me proud of myself, so i'm trying. Today i went outside for the first time in two weeks. I tried to cycle but my legs are so weak from being in bed all day that i was wheezing after 15 minutes. 
Im still proud though. 

How did i manage to go out? 
i'll tell you in hopes it helps you too.

I was there lying in bed. The blinds were closed and the room was dark. It was 4:30 pm. I had been scrolling social media for a long time and i was getting bored of it. I feel like a waste of time. Then it started hitting me as always: ""you have to do *something* "". Im afraid of doing things, of responsibilities. 

I tried to coax myself into it: ""do something to make you happy and proud"". But it's so hard to get out of bed. I wiggled my legs: limbs still working: check. I wiggled my arms too then my head. I did the worm in bed and using that wormy energy, i sat up. WOW! next step: dont think. keep your mind as blank as possible, like when you meditate. then.. GET UP!! 

if you cant blank the mind (happens to me often) then i just think.. ""I FEEL LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT. I FEEL LIKE A FUCKING HOT GARBAGE LIQUID AND IM LAYING IN BED LIKE A BEACHED WHALE. SO I MIGHT AS WELL FEEL LIKE THIS STANDING UP CAUSE IM TIRED OF BEING SO FUCKING USELESS FUCK YOU FOR MAKING ME SO USELESS SHIT DEPRESSION. 
And i use that anger to get up. Afterwards i do things that give me a self esteem boost: Dressing in something cool, listening to my favorite playlist... and i keep with the motions until im outside. 

((thank also the meds i take that give my legs a very tingly feeling that doesn't go away unless i move)) 

And thats it thats how i took a shower... and did 15 minutes of cycling... and ate a sandwich. 

(((note tho that it was on the easier side since i like dressing up and being outside, its just hard to actually do it. This is not something ive been able to apply to... washing dishes :((( 

Today i did something that made me proud and happy. I might be depressed but i try to get better.  But i don't know if ill manage tomorrow.. im getting tired of these long days of doing mundane things like im in the olympics...

TLDR: To get out of bed and start your day do the worm until you feel stupid enough to get up.
Try to do things that make you happy as a daily routine before you try to do things that worry you. 
Meditate (basically to empty your mind and see the negative/positive thoughts pass by and just be like ""huh ok"" but give them no importance."
Everything makes me desperately hysterical,2,ml88rp,0,"TW;
I have battled with depression since I was about 15. I’m 21 now and it’s the worst I’ve ever been. I have been on and off medication with small bouts of low mood being my biggest concern, but over the past 12 months it has escalated. 

During the COVID lockdown (past tense as I live in Australia) I increased my sertraline dose to 100mg, but after finding it was making me extremely erratic and (whilst not having consistent low mood) I was finding myself fighting with my partner and having these explosive violent meltdowns all the time. I decided to start decreasing my dose and I sit on 50mg now. It’s horrible. I find myself constantly in harrowing sobs over simple things and having suicidal ideation. (I don’t wish to die but I wish to severely harm myself to have an excuse to be fast tracked into care and have all my responsibilities be taken away.)

I have an irrational fear (?) of lonely people. Not myself necessarily but the thought that other people, even randoms can be lonely and I guess, loser-ish? Anyway I’ve been sensitive about that since I can remember but now it’s debilitating. I can’t go 5 minutes without welling up in tears about the thought of someone eating alone or a child playing by themselves. I am also finding myself melting down over the innocence of cute objects. I have anxiety about the stuffed animal (yes I have a few stuffed animals still) falling on the floor or god forbid an object that has the resemblance of a face, or something really childlike and naive about its appearance, about it being one on its own. Again I’m finding this anxiety debilitating. 

I feel so angry all the time and it’s like I have randomly decided to resent and hate my older brother. He has severe bipolar, ocd, adhd, and ptsd (we are both child sex abuse survivors, which probably explains a lot to do with this whole innocence upset thing). I have never hated my brother I have always loved him like my best friend but recently I just resent him so much. I don’t have any reason to though. 

I can’t figure out how to make these irrational weird feelings of desperate sadness over stupid things go away. I have booked myself into a dbt clinic and tried finding a new psychiatrist but the wait time for those things is about 3 months and I need help NOW. What do I do."
Life sucks ass,16,ml86ae,5,"Modern life seems to be at its worst for me, rents are at an all time high taking 50-70% of my income, the job market sucks, wages are low af unless you magically found some high paying role or studied into it, cost of things just keep going up a basic ass ice cream is $5 now, fresh vegetables and foods cost too much now, climate is fucked, forests are getting destroyed, animals are dying at record numbers, oceans full of plastic, poverty and hunger is at all time high, homeless people everywhere, housing crisis even for working people with full time jobs, homes cost $1m for something built in the 50s, drugs are shite low quality and more expensive than ever, movies and tv shows have gone to trash kong was pos, there’s a global pandemic going on, can’t travel abroad anymore, traffic is crazy af  in rush hour now it extends from 12pm til 7pm at night that’s if there isn’t a crash, public transport is expensive, slow and crowded, no concerts, no sports games, everything is just crowded now and overpopulated I wish I could move to small town problem is obviously no jobs or houses available or people I know there. 

Positives I guess is alcohol is at an all time low cost but I don’t drink anymore, internet and technology stuff is cheap all around, internet is pretty sweet, food options are good and tasty, porn is better than ever but that’s probably about it."

I broke down because of a phone call.,7,ml84hr,4,"
I don't post much about my issues, since I don't see much of a reason to do so but I guess, i need to vent. 

For background, I have a few friends, most of them long distance, I also have a few people who are interested in me romantically and/or sexually too. I don't pay much attention to them but, I recently met a specific person who is really wanting a connection with me.

My depression has been super severe lately so I don't typically respond because I don't have the mental energy to do so. This person wanted to call me but I haven't exactly called anyone in the spur of the moment in years now. I tried my best to push myself to accept but I eventually broke down and started crying.

I vented to them that I felt worthless, that I suffered so much trauma in my life and that I was so sorry for bothering them.

I decided to distance myself from the situation just so I could get myself together. They eventually went to sleep and I just feel so alone and useless right now. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

Everything sucks."
Tinnitus from antidepressant?,2,ml80d7,1,"I just started taking meds again after three weeks going without, and my ears have been ringing loudly, almost painfully, every now and then. My left ear rings more often than my right. This happened last year, too, when I first took my meds. Has anyone experienced the same thing? If so, how did you deal with it?

For reference, my meds are escitalopram and quetiapine."
I feel like people don't take me seriously just because I am a teen.,4,ml7yp9,1,it's like people see teens as a prep for adulthood rather than something real that has problems and someone needs to address them. my parents think that have complete control over me and I make sure that they will be crushed every time they start acting like it(basically they abuse me in multiple ways and I abuse back). my mom takes me not going to school more seriously than me ditching my therapist session. everyone acts like I don't know shit about anything and when you cross 18 you suddenly know everything. it's fucking annoying and limiting. I have attempted suicide is that not enough for them? 
I live in Italy and I think it's the reason of my depression,3,ml7xta,2,"I live in Naples Italy and personally i don't like it since I was a child I always wanted to go away from here , i don't have any friends or a particular job that makes me happy to be here, not even my family makes me happy to be here.

But anyway, I’m 25 and feel like I haven’t lived. I haven’t traveled the world, I haven’t had sex yet, I haven’t done anything. I’m trying not to be so angry and frustrated with life but I am. I really am. All I know is trauma and pain. I’m just now seeing a psychiatrist about things that happened years ago that affect me to this day. I feel like my entire life has passed me by and that I’ll never be happy. I feel like I’ll never have stories to tell or experiences to share. I don’t have friends. I won’t sit here and say it’s other people. It’s me. All I’ve ever wanted was a friend but everyone always leaves, so anyone that comes into my life, I immediately cling to them. I swear I try not to, it’s just that I’m so desperate for a friend that I become overly dependent to the point where it most likely suffocates them :(

Had my exams, got the result, a bit disappointing but better than I'd expected. Then, I discovered that there's an entire group talking shit about me; hell people I held close and trusted which I don't even do but like a dumbass, I had done that shit again. people were saying I cheated on exams, they were saying that it was impossible for me to get the grades I did get before, and every time. Academics are the only thing I have always been good at and it was so hurtful hearing people talk about me like that. They didn't know my grades, they didn't know my standards, because they have never even spoken to me. It shouldn't affect me but it does, it does so bad, because where do I put in my trust now, with what belief now, they were talking shit about every single thing I do, how do I cope with it, idk, but now I wish I could slice my chest."
"I dont know, I need help",1,ml7puc,0,"So for a really long time now I have been feeling... upset isnt quite the right word, maybe numb? I will preface this by saying in my mind I have lots of reasons to be happy, I can wear a smile like a pro, I dont really have hardships in my life but yet this numbness/sadness hangs onto me. I feel like I am just mental as I can not find any motivation to even fix my own problems, I am 27 and still live with my parents and that feels like I am a massive failure, I like my job but I feel like I am stuck, I applied for a teaching training course, paid for it and have only done one thing with it, I just stare at it and cant bring myself to head towards happiness. A thing that gets me down and I feel like I have no power over is my relationships, I have a couple close friends who I love dearly but I have only had 2 girlfriends, both lasted three years and I dunno, I guess I feel so much happier in a relationship but I dont wanna rush into something and I dont do well with expressing my emotions much either, even this is hard. I would love some advice, or even just someone to be able to spot something in me as I never thought I would be in this position, I wouldnt say that I have depression but god knows maybe that is what this is. I just want help and a way to stop this self destructive part to finally be able to feel happy again because honestly cowardice is the thing that is keeping me going these days"
Brain fog on SSRI?,2,ml7mej,3,"Hey all,

I've just started taking Fluoxetine (Prozac?) 20mg for the last two weeks - this is my first time taking someone to help with my anxiety and low moods so I don't have much experience in this.. 

I've noticed the last few days I've had severe brain fog where I'm struggling to communicate or feeling disconnected / disassociated from situations - I'm having trouble recollecting things or engaging in a conversation. Although they do seem to be helping to improve my mood. 

I know Fluoxetine takes around 6 weeks to truly kick in, but I'm not sure if this is just a temporary side effect whilst I adjust or if this is a sign that this isn't working for me as it should? 

Does anyone have any experience with this that could shed some light? 

Thanks ✌️"

I Hate My Friends,3,ml7cxx,0,"That’s it. I just hate them. So many things about them. I don’t even hang out with them. They try to get me to, but I don’t go out for multiple reasons. I can’t wait until I graduate highschool so that I never have to speak to them again. And it isn’t just the mental illness speaking here. I’ve shown other people I was acquainted with before, as well as my family, some of the things they say and they don’t understand why I’m friends with them either. I don’t know if you’ve ever been on r/illnessfakers or r/fakedisordercringe but one of them is exactly like that, if you want an example. It isn’t just speculation. Just today they said they didn’t realize a symptom that I’ve told them I’ve experienced, that they’ve always said they don’t relate to, was a symptom of something they are faking, (found out through family) and suddenly they experience it??

Living to die,44,ml7a6v,7,"The thought ""I hope I die soon"" goes through my head every single day, multiple times a day. I bide my time, waiting, hoping, and manifesting my elimination. My love for my family stays my hand for now so I just pray for the end while trying to keep it together and be as present as my mind allows. I told myself this mental state was temporary and if I waited it out, I could feel normal again and find some joy or value in living. Unfortunately  I'm still not there.

This is my moment of weakness.

Up at 4am, crying silent tears of lament over who I used to be and my complete lack of a future. I don't see prospects for romantic love, a good career, or ever being able to contribute to my family's life in any meaningful way as I trudge along day by day chained by my depression. I'm watching my dreams turn to ash right before my eyes as I wait for my lost motivation to come back to me. 

Guilt and shame are my most common emotions. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I just want it all to be over. The scariest thought, as I hold myself back from trying to just end it all, is that I'm not meant to die by someone else's hand or through sickness or through an accident. I worry I was always meant to live a long, unfulfilling life of mental suffering and self hatred. Maybe I'm the only one who can carve my way out of this horrorscape. 

I'm always wondering what I'm waiting for, what's the point? I love my family and they love me but why can't they see that I'm so worthless and broken that it's time to let go."

Hospitalized for reasons other than mental health,3,ml77kv,7,"But they won’t give me my mental health medications. Which is one reason why I’m awake at nearly 4am. I had a nightmare because I didn’t get my prazosin. 

Also when I asked for juice last night they took away my water and said I am NPO until the doctor decides if I need more tests.

I’m diabetic. My blood sugar was 89 after dinner. So the second reason I’m awake is I’m hungry, have a bad hunger headache and keep having hypoglycemic feels (idk what to call them but I get this weird sensation down all my limbs when I’m hypo). I said I felt hypo and she said I can’t have any food. 

They just think I’m a fatass who can’t control their food intake. But I manage my blood sugar well. I might be fat but I take care of my blood sugar and my a1c is 6.0. 

Every time I put my phone down I notice my head hurts and how hungry I am and I get depressed. I miss my son. I was supposed to do Easter with him today."
The sad thing about being depressed.,3,ml75ae,0,"You’re just told to suck it up, move on and continue.

Nobody cares that you’re in such a volatile state. Nobody cares that you haven’t eaten in a week. Nobody cares that you’re unable to get up out of bed.

Often told to reach out to people, friends, family or even a therapist but why bother when they’re not concerned? You head into work and everybody there doesn’t care at the slightest whether you’re suffering mentally. You head to school, college, university and everybody assumes you’re egotistical and big headed for not socialising. You surround yourself with a crowd of people, but you still feel so lonely. Your personal desires, interests, hobbies and passions aren’t motivating. You lose touch with who you truly are but others claim that you’re being somebody you’re not - trying to force a fake perception of yourself.

Oblivious of your state until the scars appear on your body. 

Mental health is real. Just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist."
I'm so unwanted,4,ml74h9,2,"No one is ever gonna want me or love be (besides my parents). I hate my life, even though I'd be deemed so lucky to have what I have. I hate being me. I hate how I look, I hate how I'm so incapable of talking to people and connecting to people, I hate how I'm so incapable of doing what I need to do for my studies. 

But yeah, most of all rn, I just want to be wanted by someone. I don't want to be someone's last choice, or only choice... but that's what I am. No one would choose me if they could have someone else.

I'm so tired of this. If my parents weren't alive, I would kms. I'll never have a good life, I'll always be alone and I'll have to see everyone around me be happy with their SO's, and move forward in life.

my best friend confessed to feeling extremely depressed.,51,ml72f5,9,"i don't know what to do. my best friend recently sat me down and explained to me that he has been feeling very, very down lately and even admitted to having struggled with thoughts of self-harm and suicide. i just felt everything crumble around me because i hadn't noticed it.

i hugged him. tighter than i ever had before. and he broke down.

he told me about how he couldn't stop thinking about how ""he would be better off dead"" and how, ""you deserve better, anyways, you're too good."" and i felt my heart absolutely shatter into a million pieces. i love this guy more than anyone i know and i want nothing but the best for him. i tried being as gentle as i could while talking with him. holding his hand, rubbing his back and letting him now that i was here. and that i would continue to be there.

i asked him to stay with me for the time being, as i truly didn't feel safe about him being by himself every day. he obliged. he's been staying with me for about a week and we've begun talking back and forth about finding a therapist so he has someone to talk to. during this week i've noticed so many things i hadn't before. he spaces out a lot more. he has a lot of nightmares and rarely sleeps easily (i stay up with him until he falls asleep) and he always smiles like he's about to cry. i really, really want him to find someone to talk with. 

though i want to help him, i can't do what a professional does.

i wanted to come on here to ask, am i doing the right thing getting this involved? did i do something, that i shouldn't have? what can i do to continue to support him? i would really appreciate serious answers as i want to be able to support him properly. thank you."

Why the fuck do I miss her so much if she was so fucking mean to me... it shouldn't hurt this bad. I should be happy. But I'm not. Even though she wounded me, it hurts more to not be with her. I got so used to having her that I feel so lost and empty without her. I feel so alone. And angry. Angry that someone I loved so fucking much would replace me so fucking easily. Literally the day after I left her new boyfriend moved in... sleeping with her in the same bed we slept in... it should be me but I let everything fall apart... I tried to hold on... but I failed.

Should I just quit my current job,5,ml6u5l,0,"27. Been working since I'm 18. I get fired 50% of the time. Through the years I got diagnosed, there's a clear pattern of illness getting worse over time.

I'm having a rough moment in life. I've just been taking my med and forcing myself to sleep since last weekend (anti-depressant that makes you sleep, not recreational drugs). Lots of dreaming so it's not like I'm resting while sleeping. I've basically been bedridden since last friday and only recently I'm coming out of bed and my back hurts but that's another story.

I can't work like this, I haven't worked at all for the last two weeks. I just pretend I'm working. Job is definitely taking me to the edge, superiors have started making demands and scolding me because of my fault.

This has been my fault, I've stopped seeing my doctor for a while, now he doesn't want me as a patient. I've tried to force myself to be employed through this hell and I only keep a job for some weeks only to get fired. I actually wish I was in the psych ward right now. Last week I was going to start crying and my mother just told me to fuck off and cry somewhere else. I'm back to living with parents and I can't expect support from them, they're doctors, they shouldn't have to put up with this, I recognize that.

Right now I just wish I had nothing to worry about. I don't even care about financial ruin.

Sometimes I Just Want to Scream.,9,ml6t5b,0,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and add for about 6-8 years now and nothing seems to ever get better. Within about 20 years of being alive I've experienced what feels like so much pressure and stress and it feels like it's never going to stop.

My family has completely blocked out my section of the family due to my dad being an illegal immigrant. He works so hard every day and it feels like everything just goes awful for everything in our lives. His brother was the one to turn him in to ICE and report him along with the entire restaurant he worked in. My mother is constantly sick with frequent returning ulcers and almost died about two years ago; we had to go for emergency surgery and fly to Mexico because American doctors refused to schedule an appointment for her since she had no insurance and we aren't extremely wealthy.

Growing up I had to take care of her while she was sick and even before then when she was constantly getting high off of prescription pills (muscle relaxers) and my older brother left me alone to deal with her and would constantly take out his anger on me while genuinely admitting that he hated me.

Then we lost my grandmother. She was the only person I trusted and could talk to about anything- the only friend I really had anywhere and the only safe place I really had. That was also about 2 or 3 years ago. She gave up living after my grandfather was practically murdered by the nursing home he was in since he had dementia (he, while being on 24 hour watch due to his lack of capacity to care for himself somehow managed to break his hip, get back on his bed and lie in his own waste for 12 hours without anybody noticing. totally normal, right?).

I'm supposed to just be okay after nothing but shit happening for my entire life, and I'm in college now. Everyday I feel terrified that this will be the last time I get to experience things in the States. If my dad is deported, my mother and brothers will follow and I can't handle being alone in this country when there's nothing here for me anymore. Everyday I feel reminded of every heavy thing in my life and I feel like I'm suffocating some days.

Most days I feel so empty and like I'm not even the one in control of my body, and some days I feel so frustrated that I just want to cry and scream. Hearing some people on campus just complain about mundane things makes me feel so irrationally irritated some days and I just want to scream and cry out my frustration, but I don't know how to let myself be angry and irritated so it just piles up until it's late at night and I relive all of it.

Last semester I was sexually assaulted by a shitty guy that I ignored every red flag while trying to date. This semester one of my friends threatened to kill themselves and I was so scared I called the police because I can't drive and they live 2 hours away.

I feel so alone. I feel so helpless to all my problems. It feels like everything is stacked against me and I don't know what to do anymore I just want to give up on everything.

My memory has been getting so bad from stress lately from all of my past feelings bubbling up and I can't tell who I am some days. I can't tell what I like or enjoy or what makes me happy. Everything tastes terrible, everything looks awful to me. I feel like everything I've done has been a mistake since nothing has gotten better. Sometimes I feel like I'm being dramatic when I try to vent to someone or think about it, and always back out of opening up to anybody on campus or in my personal lives, but when I'm awake late at night it just feels so awful to remember all of the awful things I've had to see and go through.

I feel pretentious or whatever the right word it is for even admitting some of these feelings. Maybe I'm just a shitty person and all of these things are bad karma or something I can't tell anymore. It just feels like every time I take steps forward I get hit 3 steps back and it makes me sick to think about a lot of these things.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if anybody reads this I just need to get it somewhere and out of my head to get some sense of relief or reality it just feels so overwhelming sometimes. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired of feeling all of these overwhelming feelings it's to the point it makes me physically ill, and it hurts because none of my ""friends"" on campus can understand any of this and there's nothing anybody can do to help."
Invalidated by one of my closest friends...,1,ml6qsv,0,"This happened a couple weeks ago but I’m still really upset about what happened. Keep in mind that he states that he’s depressed as well. I also did NOT tell him much about what I was going through so I don’t know why he was acting like I was constantly annoying him with my issues? I will just quote some of the things he said to me:

“You’re acting like the world’s over, like your life is at its end. Get over it, it’s not that deep. Everyone has problems, you’re always talking about ending your life. That’s problematic.”

“You’re attention seeking.”

“You’re always like “I hate life omg omg” then do something about it.”

“You’re blowing up my dms about being suicidal like ?”

“You told me you wanted to kill yourself, why tell me if you were going to do it.”

“You’re victimizing yourself by saying your parents being mean and strict is ruining your life and emotionally traumatizing you. I know what they’re doing is wrong, but you saying you want to kill yourself over it is extreme.”

“Nobody suicidal would tell people they’re gonna do it, which is why it looks like you’re attention seeking.”

(I told him that it’s fine now and that it doesn’t matter anymore.) “Then it was never severe enough to kill yourself over in the first place, if you’re fine now.”

It's getting harder and harder to hold on,3,ml6n2c,1,"Everything makes me angry. Every action, every word, every fucking glance. I'm frustrated beyond words.

So I cut myself for the first time ever. Part was because I was curious if it really releases something in me. But nah, short pain and instant regret. Not because of the cut. But because the way I know I will be treated if it comes out.
Don't get me wrong. This is not an cry for help. Not every one has to be ok, happy or anything. I want it to be ok, that everything sucks. I don't want to hide how I feel anymore. It's so tiring to pretend to be ok.
I don't want my familiy, friends or my boyfriend to think I'm a bitch who can't keep it together.

Why keep holding on, if you don't even know why? Am I supposed to suffer through my existence, so others don't feel bad about themselfs? Why am I stuck in this fucking limbo? How long can I keep this going?"

It’s happened to me a couple times where I’ve talked to someone who almost felt like they were laughing internally at me and then would purposefully act like they were in a good mood after talking to me. Wtf? Maybe I’m too soft hearted but I can’t even fathom doing that to someone who is hurting."

I constantly feel like I’m drowning in my own pain,10,ml606x,1,"I’ve struggled with depression since 2009. I’ve never had anyone to really help me or talk to me about any of it. I’ve even contemplated suicide and almost tried it during my high school years. Never told anyone about it except for one person.. we haven’t talked in several years and they probably don’t even remember me anymore. Fast forward to now, I try to enjoy the little things in life. I have a few hobbies but no one to really discuss them with. So it’s just me. I (M) found someone (F) that I’ve enjoyed talking to. I told her everything there is to know about me and vice versa. I thought we were two peas in a pod. But my feelings for her made me end up losing her as she only saw me as a friend and now she won’t even talk to me anymore because I shared my feelings with her. She was truly the only person that understood me and made me feel safe. I’ve known her for several years but really only got back in contact with each other a few years ago. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I also suffer from bad body image issues. I abuse PEDs in order to make me feel somewhat better about myself but it just doesn’t matter.. no matter what I do, I’m still a loser. Can’t get the one girl I truly believed was “the one” to even care. My parents think I’m a loser. Everyone thinks I’m a loser. I have no one but the pain inside of me telling me that this is it for me and I will never find true happiness.

I sit here every single night questioning myself if my time will finally come to where I will become truly happy. It’s been 12 years. It hasn’t. I just don’t want to be alone anymore. I don’t want to be a waste of oxygen anymore. I want to be loved, successful, happy.

I try to push myself to do things, and I've done a lot already, but still this feeling persists. Does it ever go away? Will I just keep pushing myself until I die? Only time will tell, I guess.

But I'm realizing too, every activity I do, it's not because I WANT to do it, it's because I'm trying to distract myself from my head. 

Playing a video game? I'm just trying to silence the negativity in my head and focus on something else.

GOing for a walk? Trying to escape these feelings of loneliness, isolation, and paranoia. 

Watching a movie? Trying to escape my life.

"Lost my (25F) close friends I connected w over quarantine, for being too depressed",2,ml5qve,1,"I don't even know where to write this, but I don't think the average person can relate, so I am posting here. I can't be bothered to make a burner account. Everyone is an adult in this situation, but most are 21~23. This will be only from my POV and condensed to just the parts relating to being depressed.

I recently, only a bit over a week ago, lost an entire close knit group of friends who had set up a virtual ""intervention"" over things I said on my private twitter that I have used for 7 years as a coping mechanism. They accused me of many things including misleading them on purpose to make them worry, and saved screenshots that they sent amongst each other to theorize what it may be about. They all sent in their examples of my venting(some which I deleted and had a timestamp of '4 minutes ago') and attached their thoughts to each one; even the friends who did not have access to this account. Also, I think this is important to add, but I warned each person that it was for my venting and warned them about how it was a lot. I never handed out the account personally, and only accepted a follow request after talking to them first. I tried to give any context and explain how that made me uncomfortable that they'd assume so, but was told I wasn't supposed to talk. I eventually left the conversation and after one girl tried to call me, I texted her saying I needed time to think and process. After I slept on it, most of them blocked me and told me I wasn't worth their time. I've been struggling a lot with thinking they are right.

Has anything similar happened to anyone else? I have no idea what to do at this point since I was already extremely lonely (they already had started leaving me out for around 2 months) and don't know if I should talk to anyone else, as any other friends I haven't talked to much since the pandemic, and ALL are connected in some way to at least one person in this ""friend group"". I feel like if I say anything, whoever I reach out to would share what I said to the group and my words would be twisted again.


I'm trying to hard to battle this while already being at a low point in my depression after experiencing two major deaths only about a month apart late 2020. I try to keep my mind distracted, but I'm often reminded of them, as a lot of my hobbies involved at least one of them in some way. I'm very numb at this point."

The next morning, I asked my teacher why my grades became low. I worked really hard on his subject! I gave it so much time and respect, and I gave my everything to it. But he still gave me a low score because I didn't put it in big caps. I started crying during class, then my mother started shouting at me repeatedly.

"My (25 M) gf (26 F) wants to die, I don't know what to do.",3,ml5mim,0,"Hi fellow redditors,  


There is a lot going on, but I will try to be as objective as I can while giving context. I'll try to ask as many questions as I can to clarify things if necessary as I will likely forget something, but me and mostly my gf need help. TL:DR at the bottom. (hopefully will be ""tldr sized"")

My (25 M) GF (26) is dealing with depression since she was a teenager but got drastically worse when she lost someone really close in her family. Since then she's been in a number of therapists and psychiatrists without success, and is losing hope. Before knowing her I really didn't know anything about depression and I am really ashamed of myself for still not understanding it. We've been together for 3 years now and things were okay I guess, with ups and downs until last year. She has been fighting against a combination of depression, occasional anxiety and panic episodes, binge eating, fibromyalgia and issues with her body image (which I contributed to that). I've been living with her and her family for about 6 months now and it's being rough, to say the least.

About the last issue, last year right before pandemic hit, she had a pretty heavy (for me) surgery involving a liposculpture and breast implant saying (her words) it would be helpful against her depresison. I was against that since she was not physically okay to begin with (coughin heavily) and she was beautiful the way she was, but she insisted. Things went downhill since then, she almost died from anemia days after surgery, still coughing her lungs out, started complaining about burning on her back, and when the pandemic hit, all post-op was halted. With the scars and swelling her self-steem lowered and every movement caused some sort of pain (doctors said to just have rest), which worsen things even more.

With the pandemic, she cound't go to the surgeon/doctor and she started to really dislike the outcome of her procedures, and despite her coughing ceased, her general pain worsened, she didn't move much or doing exercises and naturally gained weight, which may have caused her breast implant to go weird (idk what her mother told me or how plastic surgery works). She was under so many medications that she hit a point of hallucinating and living another life in her head. In the meantime she also tried to overdose herself with a bunch of pills, but hopefully I could warn her mother in time to get her to a hospital. 

Lately though, she was apparently better (than she was after all above) then suddenly started to break down, bringing up everything that made and makes her sad, from her childhood traumas to me now and everyday is just pain for her, saying frequently that she doesn't want to live anymore. I can't even imagine how much pain she is enduring since last year and I am at a loss. She loves me and I absolutely love her, it is soul crushing to see her in the current state and I feel like shit for I could have been the person who helped her instead of making things worse. I am so much grateful for having her in my life, I don't want to give up on her. I have a feeling that she will give up if I do so, but it is not what is making me being with her.

Today she didn't want to take any prescribed medication but some Stilnox and muscular relaxant. Been half asleep all day, barely speaking or mumbling when waking up from nightmares, only wanting to eat cereal and milk (which she never did since we were together) complaining like a spoiled child, rarely eating healthy things. She barely gets up from the bed.  
I read about BII or Breast Implant Illness recently, and many of the related physical symptoms match with hers, but idk what to do since there is no hospital available in case of happening any sort of complication after removing the implants, like happened before when she put them on. And also her surgeon said it can't be officially ""diagnosed"", so it might or might not be it. It's just too much of a coincidence for me.

About my contribution to her depression, I was struggling with porn and masturbation addiction before even knowing her, and since she has issues with herself about how she looks, I never told her about it. Even when she found some material, which was more than once, I couldn't tell her and from then on she doesn't trust me and her self-image issues became even worse. For her, it was like I cheated on her and I don't disagree, I should never had done that in the first place. I'm ""clean"" for almost a year now, but she obviously doesn't believe it.

I'm really frustrated about my uselessness and everything. No health professional seems to care, pingpong-ing her to another speciality, I can't ""express"" my frustration in any form or else it could make things worse than they are now, and can't even think about college anymore (yea, I'm still at it) or even hug her because of her pain. I just want things to get better, I know I am still far from being the best person for her, but I'm willing to do anything, anything to help her.  
I'm sorry for this messy wall of text, it's just how I am now. Any words I'm sure will be helpful. Thanks in advance.  


TL:DR; GF has severe depression and I made things worse. She had plastic surgery last year and since then is only pain, had one suicide atempt and now doesn't want to live anymore due to the physical pain and bad post-op (mostly due to covid). Now she barely gets outside bed, tired of enduring her pain, not wanting to go to therapy, taking medicine or even live anymore. Maybe her implants are making her ill (BII), but there is no way to diagnose and every hospital is full of covid in case there is any issue after removal. How can I help her?"

How do you live for yourself?,5,ml59tv,2,"Get ready for some real glass-half-empty shit...

People always say “you have to live for yourself” or “happiness comes from within”, but how does that even make sense? Everything you do is for someone else, even if it’s for someone you don’t know yet. Your wealth, money, and overall success — isn’t it all just for the purpose of creating a life worth sharing, and a legacy worth passing on?

Where is the part of my life that I’m supposed to live for me? I’ve repeatedly come back to suicidal thoughts, so much so that the only thing stopping me from ending it all at this point is the fact that I don’t want to hurt the people I care about in the process. At this point, I feel like a puppet on strings.

So for those of you out there who *have* found happiness from within, where did you find it? And how did you finally reach it?"
Friend is depressed- How to get them to seek professional help?,3,ml535f,0,"Throwaway for privacy and used gender neutral for added level of my friend's privacy.

I have a an old friend, the type that has 1 or 2 hour calls every few months.    We live hours away via flights and are not real close but still friends (per my friend I am one of their only friends)

This friend called me today and I started talking about the Baylor win tonight knowing full well my friend could care less about sports, because I joke about stuff.     

My friend then got all weird about asking me for financial advice or something but then said it was a bad time to ask something.    I told them to ask me whatever and they fell down a rabbit hole after some prodding about losing friends and that their marriage is very bad.      The friend instead of asking financial question they just kind of mumbled non questions.

Now, I have spoken to multiple friends going through marriage issues including imminent divorce before and I am not good at advice but can be a good sounding board for problems.

    I have also had a friend kill himself 10 years ago. I was one of the 4 last people to see him alive having Saturday drinks and invited him to the bar but he decided to go home and isolate and kill himself 3 days later.  It stuck with me bigtime that I missed ALL the signs that I get worried easily about similar issues in others.

Back to my friend now, they feel alone and depressed.   I asked them in as roundabout way but getting to the point if they were imminently suicidal.   They were clear they are not tonight but they are not sure about the long term(meaning yes some suicidal thoughts).    They are clearly in a bad place.    I recommended a therapist and my friend stated they have gone through 10 in the last few years.

    My personality is one of fight through whatever problems you are having including getting help if needed for that fight.   I am not well equipped for depression conversation of someone that is defeated and suicidal, it is not my strong suit.  

I was clear via call and via text after call that people love my friend as my friend stated that no one cares about them (typical suicidal language from what I understand). 

We will have a call later this week.   My friend needs help but I can't do much.    We have no friend crossover that I could reach out to.

What would you recommend is a good help for depression when therapists are not working.    In other words how do I convey successfully my friend should talk to some type of professional... and what kind and how to find that kind?   

TLDR: Depressed likely suicidal friend, therapists not working.

Without my friends, I seriously don’t know what I would do.  Traumas from my young childhood scar me to this day and I can’t stop my brain form making me relive my worst moment of my childhood over and over again.  It’s as if my brain creates a movie and I’m forced to watch it, every single fucking night.  And I can’t change a thing.  It’s hurts, watching these old memories, traumas, losing my best friend since preschool.  Also, my parents don’t know how to help me.  They just hire a therapist (I’ve had 3 already and they don’t help at all) and they have even sent me to the hospital before which traumatized me and is the reason I now have trust issues.

I’m always looking at my phone constantly to see if I get a notification from a. Friend or just someone so that I can distract myself.  So many times I dream that my parents would just randomly wake up at night, hear me crying myself to sleep, come in, and ask me the words that I’ve always want to hear “Are you ok?”  Man, that all I want to here.  I also constantly check my phone hoping that someone would do the same.  Being lonely is killing me, and although I don’t want my life to be this way, I am to shy and anxious to talk to or even ask out a girl out of fear of rejection.

Apparently abdominal pain and trouble peeing isn't cause for concern, I couldn't possibly need a blood test at 27, and he can't direct me anywhere useful for mental health. I've been so terrified of trying to get help for years and I felt so ashamed asking him all these things and it turns out no one gives a shit anyway. All this time I thought that help was out there and I just needed to overcome the anxiety and depression to ask. But I guess there's no fixing my life. Back into my hole I go."
How do you feel from this feeling?,4,ml4uhl,0,"Dear Community,

First off, thank you all for providing a space to talk. I’ve found during this pandemic Reddit has been a huge help in feeling more connected.

I’m seeking advice into how to move beyond my current situation which makes me feel like I’ve really hurt myself and those around me.

I was studying last year in the Netherlands and things went sideways with my studies for a plethora of reasons. I was forced to move back home to Canada with my parents as I got myself into another school in London, UK.

Most of my friends have moved away by now, but I still have a few friends I see. I spend most of my time studying alone preparing myself not to fuck up my school situation again when I begin in Sept 2021. I've constantly been feeling I'm such a failure, and that I've wasted so much time and haven't progressed it sufficiently.

When I see my friends and family, I feel like I'm always hiding that I feel so defeated even though my next school is excellent and it should be a great new chapter ahead. I've always felt my family doesn't support my goals so I don't open up to them.

I just want to feel better. I want to feel like I've healed my depression. I want to feel like my past fuck ups will lead to something worth while. I want to feel that I am a good friend. I want to restore my faith in myself. I feel it's dwindling.

Does someone have some ideas as to how I can confidently restore my inner strength?

Feeling so lost."
It's neverending...,10,ml4rwr,1,"It doesn't matter how much weight I lose. It doesn't matter how hard I try, how much work I put into my stupid brain, how much therapy I get myself in. How pretty or ugly I truly am. It doesn't matter what I achieve. It doesn't matter how much people love me. How many animals need me and care about me. It doesn't matter if my hair looks good or not. It doesn't even matter how intelligent I am. I will always feel this way, the pain doesn't stop. I was groomed to hate myself. To either always be sad or angry. I suppose I should commend the people in my life that led to this conditioning, it was a total success for them. Thanks. So much. I'm on a downward spiral, thinking things that nobody should ever have to. Like fantasizing that someone will end me, like fantasizing having a good day and then a freak accident ends me. I never asked to be born. I cannot beg people enough to really give a fuck and do their research before they decide to breed, but it doesn't matter what I say anyway. I'm so tired. I hurt in ways you don't see. Laugh at the fatass idiot you groomed into ED. Laugh at who you gave body dysmorphia to. Who you traumatized. Who you assaulted. I don't want to feel. I'm just waiting for the void at this point."
Idk I’m just ranting it’s kinda dumb but idk 😐,3,ml4rr5,0,"I feel so useless and depressed, but my life is completely fine. Nothing bad has happened in years. I should be over my stupid trauma by now so why am I still scared of the man that hurt me?

The world doesn't need me anymore.,2,ml4nop,2,"Sometimes I do not know what's wrong with me... Whenever I join or start a conversation, no one is ever going to respond to me. Whenever I ask my friends questions or meanings about what they have said, it seems like they never allow me to join their chats. Whenever others go out and have fun, not only am I not invited, but nobody is willing to tell me where they are going. I always have been jealous of others' ability to join in any group of friends without encountering any repulsion.

I have always tried my best to answer and address other's issues whenever they have difficulties, usually about academics... I am very willing to help. However that doesn't pay off. I start realizing everyone is just making use of me without really treating me as a friend.

What should I do? I feel really upset everyday and I think the world is just leaving me alone."
I ruin everything.,5,ml4hod,1,"The amount of relationships and opportunities I’ve destroyed or ruined is immeasurable. I’ve lost so many people because I’m such a total pos. Everyone keeps saying it’ll get better and I won’t always feel this way but it just keeps getting worse. I’m an alcoholic and I’m not even 20, recently I keep having episodes of anger where I punch walls or just chop wood for hours, or I just cry about how horrible I feel. Sorry for the rant I just need somewhere to get this out of my mind."
Hourglass ..,5,ml4e72,1,"I feel like my life is like an hourglass that is dependent on my dogs life. I really feel like once he’s gone, I’m gone too. I can’t imagine going through this world anymore, especially without him. I’ve been hurting for so long and no one will hear me because even when I try to express it I’m always judged or ridiculed to just “get help”. I’ve tried!! I’ve been to therapists, I’ve prayed .. I’ve done everything I can think of. No one understands :( He’s been there through all my happiness, all my hurt. I don’t want to be without the one living entity that’s kept me alive 😥"
What should I do?,3,ml4c0v,1,"I 19F am severely depressed. I've had depression since I was 9 this was because the man who raised me randomly died. We believed the combination of him drinking and him having diabetes caused it. Right after he passed my mother's long time boyfriend who had just gotten out of jail started verbally and mentally abusing me. I'll admit I was chubby, weird, and lazy so I got bullied often on top of this even by him. Despite this I kept trying and eventually after a few years I got better but randomly it all came back one night. I tried taking my life. No one took it seriously and just thought it was a cry for attention. Then when I turned 16 I told my mom about some serious abuse I suffered from by one of her boyfriends when I was 4, she called me a liar. Well I kept pushing and eventually I slimmed down, made friends and even met a amazing man who is my fiance. Eventually it all came back when my mom left randomly to take care of my grandpa and move him back to her farm. She left and missed my 18th birthday and has barely even spent any time with me since then. That same year my brother started huffing air duster cans to the point he crashed a car. We tried constantly to get him to stop but his pregnant wife kept enabling his behavior when he would start to get better. Then the pandemic came and with it I lost almost all my friends well now I don't think they ever were friends. So I've been stuck in my house with my fiance who constantly makes me insecure and gaslights constantly. Things got much worse recently because last month on March 3rd my brother died. Me and my mom rushed when we heard he was unconscious to her farm but by the time we got there he had been dead for hours. He died in her tractor and no one found him until 4 hours after he passed. I've tried to stay strong this time but I just don't know if I can anymore. I want to stay strong for my mom and for everyone but I just feel so alone. No one has even taken a second to ask if I'm ok and I'm not ok. It's getting too much for me. I just want to go to school or just start working but I can't. I can't work until I get my surgery in June and I'm scared I'm going to go through that alone too. I can't start school untill I receive the scholarships I need. I'm just so scared and I just feel alone in this work, I just want to be happy. I don't know what to do anymore."
I feel like I can't really do things until I get meds.,2,ml4bsr,0,"I have a few months of college left. I find myself being really isolated every day and idk how healthy that is. I do my best to attend online class, do my tasks for work, I am in therapy. But I'm always avoiding and isolating since it is much too painful to see or be around others too long. 

My depression is also getting bad and I start to think I can't really 'do things' until I get meds. Sure I can do things, I just can't do them well, I can only get through them. I've been working out again and it's something I look forward to since it's something I can just do. Each rep, etc. 

I small talk when I can, but really there's a lot of emotional baggage with me. I think it might scare people if they see how alone I am. How I sit in isolation, sometimes just lost, anxious, scared. If I hear noise of people I would move somewhere to try to not be seen. The clothes I have are also kind of old, some from high school since I never got new stuff, but I have to buy things special for my size but then I don't want to spend the money since I'm scared if it's wrong then I pay for returns, etc. So when I choose things to not look like a piece of shit or keep wearing the same thing. 

Honestly I just need a lucky break. I can keep on 'doing things' but I can't produce real work. I can only get through, like each rep of a dumbbell. It's a problem since I need to do real work if I want to not fail out, and to keep being employed. To slowly stop the isolation that really was with me my whole life. To spend money on myself. To clarify at least some of my plan for the future. I'm still drifting, even things like planning a meal in are hard (including eating it) but I can get through things and to stop comparing with all the others whose lives are filled with people, and high achievement. To not be bitter about what could have been. To not feel like I'm missing chances."
how am I supposed to live in a terrible world like ours?,3,ml45bl,3,"So much pain. So much suffering. So much loss, for so many varied, completely unnecessary reasons. How am I supposed to enjoy a cup of coffee? When I know the suffering “we” have endured. I can’t take myself seriously because I feel the pain, for what very very very little that is worth. How am I supposed to believe that I, me, tiny inconsequential me, is supposed to want to live amongst all of this pain and loss. How am I supposed to live knowing that I’m breathing air that could be used by someone else who needs it more than me."
I've lost the ability to trust any women,10,ml43b7,5,"I have been ghosted once again after making a legitimate connection. I'm tired of it, I'm tired of trying to put my self out there only to not be respected back. I'm not pushy, I don't text to much and yet I can't seem to get it right. I don't like this ""out to get me feeling"" because I know it's just my complex trauma, but like it's getting bad...

I've tried bumble I've tried tinder I've tried plenty of fish okay Cupid all of it. I've tried going to places And being sociable I've done everything I can possibly think of and it just feels like I'm doomed and nothing works and the ones I do make a connection with well you saw the above post

I understand it's coming off as a generalizing post but you've got to understand that this is just the streak of luck that I've had with pretty much every woman in my life. I want to think their are good women in the world, but it's like life is insistent they hurt me."

"Working with depression, the never ending sickness.",5,ml3yq2,3,"Having to go to work everyday while depressed is like having to work while “feeling under the weather” but everyday. The feeling of not physically being able to give it your all. You think to yourself “I’ll just call out for today and I’ll be at 100% tomorrow” but you know that there is no point because tomorrow will just be more of the same. And it only gets worse the more you think about it because there is nothing you can really do to make it go away, it’s not physical, it’s not rational, it’s your own thoughts against you. That fact alone just continues to make it worse. Knowing that your helpless to it."
i’m helpless,2,ml3x4o,0,"i’m so fucking annoying and idk what to do. i suppressed my feelings and emotions for so long and i finally let everything out and think life is good for once but then no. all my friends get driven away, all the people i look up to, my family, everyone. who’s next? my bf? my only true friend? i feel like i’m in middle school again. i have no one. i have my cat and very few places to rant. but then again those ranting places aren’t even reliable because the people i think i can trust talk shit behind my back. but whatever. i think it would just be best if i was gone. i wouldn’t bother anyone ever again. my dad wouldn’t have to worry about me being trans ruining his life. my mom has one less burden to worry about. my friends don’t have to put up with my shit any more. my bf wouldn’t be burdened by my neediness and emotional dependence. everything would be so much better if i just fucking disappeared. i love everything so much but i don’t get that same mutual feeling back. if god is real why doesn’t he just kill me yet."
Checked Out,2,ml3wsr,2,"I do not know why I am posting here. I do not know what I am reasonably looking for. I guess idc anymore and wanna express how I feel. If not to those I know for a few reasons then to others behind screens.

I am at the end of my rope, my mood swings are constant. This is largely due to years of emotional trauma and my recent attempts to help myself. Getting help I mean.

I know how I feel is irrational, I am not necessarly in a bad place in life all things considered. But the pain is horrible. The chance it may continue longer than it has  kinda makes me feel its not worth it. I am entering a new phase of my life And I am not in a place to take on things or have adversity, things normal in life. I do not have ""it"" mentally to take the next step.

I am not actively suicidal, but I think about it regularly. The idea of death I do not think is concerning to me. Like im not scared or worried about how it may affect others. My reasoning for that is that all relationships are either not bad, perhaps even positive. But not worth enduring for. The other camp is relationships that are negative, so while I am alive and here if things are bad. I do not care what they think otherwise.

Hope is what keeps me going, hope for change. Its why I keep engaged in mental health resources. But I do not know how long I can last. I am just living to breath day to day.

I apologize for the negativity and paragraphs. I may not even respond, but this is how I feel."

Throughout my entire life it’s truly a tragedy. I’ve lived such a horrible life. My parents are absolute sociopaths. I literally hate my father so fucking much. He’s not a nice guy. He’s never emotionally supportive towards me and he’s never there for me and he never takes responsibility for his actions and never sees what he did that was wrong. My mother is the same way she provokes me into fights all the time. Nobody in my family cares about me and the saddest tragedy of all is that I cut off all my friends because they always say how my family cares when they know nothing about that And they left me. A therapist I thought cared about me, left me on the street to dry. I have PTSD and borderline personality disorder and no support from everybody. I was bullied really badly for six years. The society we live it’s such a tragedy how people are so bad. I wish life wasn’t like this. I gave up trying to get help because I truly believe there’s no hope.

He immerses himself in work and he's a top achiever in his company but that's only to get through suicidal thoughts without actually killing himself. He feels suicidal and hopeless. He feels miserable talking about his feelings..

I can’t socialize well at school and I end up being that quiet kid, and I give off a weird vibe apparently. My romantic life seems to be going down the drain too, and I can’t do a single thing to stop it. I also have a really strong ability to put up a facade, so I seem perfectly normal and happy around everyone else. But on my own, I feel so gray. Nothing seems to make me feel worth the air I breathe, and I’m scared that the next time something bad happens it might be the last straw.

I guess I'll start with last night when I was having trouble sleeping, so I take naps pretty much every day and that causes me to have a hard time sleeping when night actually comes, so I was looking into that and I saw that that's a symptom of depression, something that's probably not good is when I was reading the bad effects of a poor sleep schedule I misread one of the effects as death and actually got excited for a second, so yeah I take 2 depression tests and both say I have very severe depression, to be honest I contemplate self oof (idk if theres a filter for the word but I dont want to check) multiple times a day, I will never really do it because I dont want to make my friends and family sad or anything, I dont know why I'm even writing this tbh, just wanted to get it off my chest, I dont want to tell my family cuz they'll probably get mad at me or freak out, theres more to this story but I'm not sure if I really want to share it all"

Does it ever get so hard that you resent anyone who doesn’t suffer from depression?,3,ml2ktz,1,I’m so envious of anyone who doesn’t have it. Anyone who seems like they don’t have to give 110% just to get out of bed.
I've Been At This For 10 Years And I Don't Want To Do It Anymore,2,ml2kqv,0,"When it first started I was in denial. It was going to be a short term thing. I thought. Just let the fog in my head leave. The dark cloud. The self doubt. The hating myself. The loneliness. The inability to focus on anything. Video games and movies were too hard. I just didn't feel great. The doctors just gave me pills and told me to go away. My primary doctor (old school) told me to go to a walk in clinic to get pills going forward. Pawn me off to someone else I guess? That's fine you're a doctor you know best right?

But it didn't get better. Doctors just kept giving me pills. I didn't know how I was supposed to feel. My depression grew and grew. I kept fighting it and thinking if I just get further. If I just hit my goals maybe the depression will go away.

But it didn't. It got worse. I hate living. Therapy. Medication. I've done it all. I cannot get better. Just let me go. My brain is broken. I am broken. 

What gives someone else the right to tell me to hold on? You vomit out hallmark card words and say words that have no fucking meaning. Empty, hallow. Because you don't have to live what I do. The pain is so much. And I can't show you. If I had a bullet in my chest or a broken leg maybe you could understand. But I have my own fucking brain saying no you were born to have depression. You weren't mean to be happy. Your ex ghosted for a reason. Medication doesn't work for a reason. Therapy doesn't work for a reason.

Because when it's all said and done. I have to be with me. I have this thing in my head making life painful. And if I could just go away. Let the depression win. Let it all go I'll be happy.

Please someone find a cure for depression. Something please help. I'm tired of this pain. I'm tired of thinking about the future. I'm tired of just everything."

When this pandemic hit I haven’t been doing well mentally, physically, academically, or socially either. I feel like I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this, so I’m resorting to random strangers online."
I struggle with feeling valid about my depression because I can still get out of bed.,1,ml2f0m,0,"My therapist has described my depression as rolling and steady. So there are lows but most of the time I am just kind of floating by. 

I can’t remember the last time I felt really happy. Which is so hard for me. I was the super excitable, hyper, fun person growing up. But now at 26 I am just so meh.

I don’t feel overwhelming sadness all the time but I also don’t feel much of anything. I feel like the only emotion that is consistent in my life is anger... I just want to be happy. I want to feel physically happy.

I hate that it is so hard to talk about this version of depression because I don’t look depressed. I can go to work and do my baseline life tasks but I am just so tired. I feel so invalid.

I just want to be happy and hyper. I want to stop breaking my fiancé’s heart because I don’t get excited for things and have been having a hard time connecting with them. 

I just want to feel something and get rid of the apathy.

Does it get better? I was prescribed Prozac, but I am just so nervous to take them. I have had them for 4 months now and took one but never took any after."
My friends shame my disorder,1,ml2bvk,1,"I don't think they always realize it, but they give me a lot of crap for my mood. 
For background, I've had depressive symptoms for a good amount of years. For as long as I can remember, I've been abnormally tired, a lack of an appetite, felt sad most of the time, and have been the first to focus on the negative aspects of life, despite me efforts not to. Although I denied my condition for years, out of fear of being weak, My doctor diagnosed me dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder).
I don't usually bring it up to anyone, but a lot of my friends definitely know of this. I try to stay on top of it, but a lot of times it gets the best of me. Whenever this happens my friends tend to make fun of or criticize my mood, either calling me grumpy,  complaining about how im always tired, or making me feel bad for not being energetic with them. 
I always try my best to be the funny energetic me, but it's so hard and exausting. I always feel the need to keep the facade of being ok, and just pass it off as staying up too late (which I rarely do).

I never feel like I can truely express myself. When in mental turmoil I feel as though I have no where to go. I've cried alone for so long that no it's hard for me to do so, like my body ran out of tears.
I've had so many friends who have said it's okay to express my emotions, and to let it all out, but whenever Ive done so, usually the response is something along the lines of ""toughen up"", or ""be a man"". They say this as I feel all I ever do is ""toughen up"". I look myself in the eye every morning and tell myself to just pull it together.
Even my past girlfriends, who tried to support me, events just complained about my negative mind set.

Sometimes I feel like I just bring down the energy of the group. When my depression is bad, I just feel this odd disassociation from life, and it's hard to fully interact with my friends. 

Depression also manifests in agitation, which also gets made fun of by my friends. 

I try to defend myself at times, and they just struggle to say sorry through their laugh. 

:/"
Compliments hurt???,1,ml2b2p,0,"Whenever my parents tell me I’m doing good I can’t help but feel like they’re lying. It makes me feel physically sick. It’s always been this way, even in preschool. I can’t understand it. It sickens me to think that someone cares about me."
I really want to put on a tourniquet and cut right now,1,ml29a7,0,"This is great, I have absolutely no idea why, but I want to kill myself and I hope this works"
They look at me like with so much disgust,1,ml292p,0,"I can feel it, they say to me “stop baking lazy” and to get working. I have failed so much and it has become so embarrassing to have my family treat me like an idiot, and not being able to do anything about it. Because there is no drive, there is no motivation, and there is no energy.
They look at me and all they see is a fat lazy idiot. They see a creature from another planet and they feel pity for me. They are not sorry, they are not understanding, they are not trying to help because they want to, they “try to help” by yelling and they do it because the feel they need to because I’m a freak and they should have pity. 
I want to die so much but I’m so scared, I wish I wasn’t scared, there is nothing for me in this world. I may still be young but I have no future."
"I failed at my dream, have nothing to show for it, and I’m being pushed out. Again. At what point does one just quit life?",1,ml25w5,3,"Hey all. Reddit is the only social network I have any more, and I really don’t have any expectations. I guess I’m just looking for an answer instead of the black void of eventuality I’m facing right now. 

People say “just find something you’re good at” and “be yourself” as if these are two things that grant automatic acceptance in life. Well not for me, and if you’re reading this, maybe not for you too. 

How do people function? What’s it like to not feel under the weight of life and only knowing how it feels to fail under the pressure? Seriously, how can people not feel like this? It’s all I can remember feeling, and I just don’t want to feel anything any more. 

My family pushed me out because I wasn’t what they wanted. I literally went out the window as a teenager, and never went back. I’ve been pushed out of any group I’ve joined since then: high school, college, jobs, college again, jobs again. Eventually, they all tire of me and want me to go. At first, things can go right, but eventually, inevitably, unerringly - I am made to leave.

How am I supposed to learn and accept who I am, when the thought and reality of who I am is so consistently unacceptable. 

I came halfway around the world to a place where everyone, even the rejects and outsiders can go, and find a sense of community and acceptance. Instead, it’s full of hustlers, and doers, and wannabe-ers. I remember how that felt. But on the other side of a decade of being here with a few aquaintances to show for it, and facing the fact that I should leave has just left me feeling a whole lot of “what’s the point?”ism

It’s not that I want to die or go out with a bang or anything that dramatic. I just want to stop existing. To stop hurting. To stop being rejected. To just make everything stop. 

I have spent a decade where I am and I have nothing to show for it. I have the same lack of funds I came with, I’m in the same entry level I came in. 

People aren’t allowed to just exist here. Or anywhere really. They have to do something, or make something, or become something. I have done none of those things, and I am left staring down a decade of paths not taken or tried, of things tried and failed, of failure upon failure with nothing to retreat to but the my tears and the fetal position in my shower.

I’m a grown ass adult and I feel like a spoiled, useless child who has no one to blame but myself, nowhere to go, and no hope left. Nothing left. 

Everything points to failure and despair. I have taken hits before and found the strength to keep going somehow. I had always found something in me that would keep me going. The believe that I could be something, that I could become something, if I could just make it and get that chance. 

Well, I came here and I got that chance and I squandered it. I got it again, and squandered again. A third time, and squandered again. And now, I know there’s no point in trying. I am a broken person. The pieces left no longer make a whole and I do not know the way back, and I cannot find the energy to care. I can only find the inclination to withdraw into a basement somewhere and die. Hardly anyone would notice, and the ones that might, would recover soon enough.

I have nowhere to be, nowhere to go, and nothing left. 

I am done. Can please someone show mercy and turn out this dim, dwindling, pathetic light?"
All I want is a fucking hug,192,ml1t3e,25,Why is it so hard to just get a hug? Something that seems so small and simple is so difficult and foreign to me I can't take it anymore

I am super excited, I realize that it is a small dose, but I am hope this will be the “kick in the butt” I need to start making some improvements.

How do I help a friend who is too depressed to accept any offers for help?,1,ml1oyt,4,"A good friend of mine is struggling with a bout of depression (he was already going through a rough time, then unexpectedly lost someone close to him to COVID on top of it). I do what I can to help him out but he's so depressed that my offers of help get greeted with a ""thanks, that means a lot"", then never get mentioned again. 

I'm genuinely not sure if my continued check-ins, offers to help out in specific ways, or invitations to hang out are helping at all or serving more as reminders that he doesn't have the energy to do things that he would want to do. Does anyone have some advice on how to be a support friend here? I'd appreciate it."
I feel that my situation is gonna get me fired from my PhD program (sorry if it's too long text),3,ml1nyx,1,"Hi all, first post here.
I'm a grad student, closeted homosexual and biker/car guy. 
This past few months have been horrible for me, I haven't been able to sleep properly, although I spend most of my time in bed, so I'm constantly tired and feel super slow in everything. My tasks for the research have been piling up and I have not been able to do any step forward, and now everytime that I think about it I become sad and melancholic and end up crying. 
My professor already threatened me about getting me fired and although I don't love my field, I don't know what to do if that happens. Although I kind of want to quit my PhD to be honest.

I don't know how to reach out for help and I don't want to talk about it with my family. I tried to reach out to the university counseling and they said they are full and recommend me to a stupid website that should be cover by my health insurance but it is giving me issues with that. 
I feel that I have no friends and no one that I can open up, any suggestion will be welcome

Love,
Jay"
I have this sinking feeling more and more.,1,ml1nr4,0,"I felt this Fear and Anger when I started doing a study course VA, my Mom bought this study course from her friend who is also VA, and tutored a lot of people to succeed. I'm sorry this story is going to be long and English is not my first language.

Some backstory, I used to work in BPO as a Customer Support, VA, and Editor in nightshift; I'll be honest I do not want to return to that living, and working in Sales makes me Anxious even though I graduated in Marketing. At home, I practice and hone my skills in Digital Art and Cooking because it is one of the few things where I can be creative and I feel joy doing so. During the time I was Jobless I was always getting pressured to go home every lunch to check up on my Grandfather who is suffering from dementia and this life stayed for years and I developed first signs of Anxiety and Anger Issues (We have no Therapists and if they are they're not supported), this resulted in me having a hard time finding a job since I cannot stay at offices since no one is at home to feed him food or water so I became his nurse. I tried freelancing at home but most clients I meet tend to screw me over for ""Exposure"". 

During the Pandemic my Grandfather's condition worsened and he recently died last month (I'm at the age of 26 and I'm a dude being his nurse) due to his Old Age and now I'm trying to find new clients and trying Streaming (Without showing my face ofc) on Video Games and Art. Oftentimes, my Mom (Most of the time) or my Sister pressure me to find a real job or start a Business with them. Now, my Mom is a brilliant woman who has worked for the Govt. and helping our little city with the economic problem during the pandemic and she is getting close to retirement which I can understand why she wants me to go take a real job, take the Civil Service Exam to become a Govt. Worker or start a Business but she never tried to start her own business in her life, there were attempts but it always involves me working alone and doing everything alone with no one to help me around to jumpstart her plans while my Sister has friends to help her boutique business.

This brings us to recent events, My Mom recently been pressuring me to take this VA Course for Amazon VA because her friend has so made a lot of people successful by turning them into Amazon VAs and I'll be honest it sounds great but I'm not interested going back as a VA anymore since I'm done with that life. She insisted me so much to take the course because it feels ""wasteful"" if I don't take the opportunity and in my heart, I felt Anger, Frustration, and Pity in my head because she was saying I am not going anywhere with Streaming Video Games and managing my Digital Art Page even though I enjoyed doing it because I know what she is saying is true because I'm new to the world of Streaming and I have a hard time finding good clients even though I've helped a Streamer grow her audience outside and even hosted in some local tournaments I'm not getting anywhere closer to the goal I wanted because I'm new to it and now she wants me to jump ship and switch to VA since she is paying for the course (It is not the most expensive course but still costs quite a hefty amount of Money) I felt pity and took the course so that she would be pleased and just stop talking behind my back for being ungrateful and for achieving nothing. 

Now, I am the second week of the course, and every time I look at these notes, My heart just feels sinking faster and anger/sadness rises but I have to keep my composure to keep myself from lashing out and saying things that I would regret towards my Mom and my sister because I love them with all my heart but I feel like the worst is about to come and I have to keep this fake attitude so I just have to keep my mouth shut. I woke up this morning now something wants to drag me and my head keeps making these alternate scenarios where I screw up again and again as the weekend classes get closer. My plan is just to push through these classes just for the month and hopefully, it'll be over soon so that I can move on. I know I feel like an un-opportunistic/ungrateful person but I just feel sinking in quicksand the more I think about it and I feel it is getting deeper now.

Sorry for the long post."
Time,2,ml1ltf,1,"When time seem to move for everyone but you. Everyone has accomplished so much but look at me sitting home doing nothing. 

I'm just alone with nothing."
I don’t know what to do,2,ml1krp,0,"I’m pretty sure my wife hates my parents.

Any time we get an opportunity to spend time with them she gets super mad and starts screaming about having to play hostess. She’s graduating in a few weeks and they wanted to come celebrate with us and maybe just maybe spend a little bit of time with us, so they decided to get a hotel room.

This just won’t do. My mil and sil are going to be here the same weekend and that will just be too many people. She just wants to relax and spend time with her mom and sister, who she sees multiple times a year.

I barely get to see my parents 2-3 times a year, and I’m usually by myself when I do.

Beyond that, I’m pretty sure her family doesn’t like me. At Christmas, they all bought gifts for her, but left me out of it. Her mom just brought her an Easter basket, but left me out of it. They’ve straight up told her if I was their husband, I would’ve been gone a long time ago.

I feel like my marriage is sinking, but I love my wife and don’t want to lose her.

Am I just overreacting?"
Finally Confronted My Abuser And My Heart Is Shattered,12,ml1kac,2,"I couldn’t take it anymore after 20 years of being abused I finally broke and confronted my “parent”and I’ll  probably be hurt for the rest of my life by what he said to me.

My father who was my main abuser denied EVER physically abusing me(the abuse ranged from beatings all the way to smothering and threats) and said That I was lying and that the only thing he said was that I have an ugly attitude and hurt his feelings by not saying I love you back. He also said that everything he did was to make me stronger and during the confrontation was acting Like he was going to hit me but was stopped by my mom

Im so hurt and feel so stupid! I wasted 20 years of my life practicing filial piety, hoping that people would love and trust me one day, and trying to live up to the things that are expected from me as my parents child in my culture for nothing! For my abuser to look me in the face and swear to god that he has never and would never abuse me. I have to live with all of these memories for the rest of my life and for what! What did I do to deserve this!?! I just wanted to be loved and I tried so hard for nothing. I’m so hurt my heart isn’t broken it’s literally shattered."
I just want someone to talk to for a while,3,ml1jqc,1,"I don't want to bother anyone, but my problem is that I feel lonely, my parents turned their back on me and I'm closed in my room with nothing else to do all day and I'm slowly losing my sanity (If I'm still sane, I don't know), I get anxious at random times and think of leaving things forever for once.

I asked for therapy but my parents keep telling me I'm okay and that they know everything will get fine, but no, I'm lonely, they don't understand I need to socialize, even if people are scary, I need to be around people, I want people to talk to and be myself and express my feelings in an open way.

Also, is there a way to keep my mind busy? I used to play videogames all day but everything is so boring now, I hate the toxicity nowadays. I've tried drawing again and doing art stuff but it doesn't feel the same way as it did when I was younger. I have no motivation to learn new stuff either. I don't know what to do."
Depression is swallowing me whole as of late (some triggers),1,ml1gwg,0,"
I’m currently (20F) struggling with depression in the midst of being separated from my family.
In the next coming months my mom will be moving to a different state with my older brother, and I’ll be staying in my home state but living with my dad who I haven’t lived with in 10 years. Long story short, dad won custody of us when they first divorced when I was about 4 or 5 because he knows many people in the court system of that city (he was a cop, has many connections), my mom spent years trying to get us back and did when I was around 10. My mom has always been my primary care giver and confidant, and I feel like I won’t be able to survive without her around.  I have no bond with my dad, he didn’t give us a great childhood (alcoholism, etc) and now I feel as If I’m being put right back from where my mom fought so hard to get me out of. It’s dawned of me that I probably have some abandonment issues, and I have always had a severe attachment to my mom. It feels like I’m being abandoned, but I’m old enough now where I feel like these feelings are immature and I shouldn’t be having them. This is the age where people go to college and get away from their families so I feel like I should be handling this a lot better. For reference I’m a junior, almost a senior and college, and when I was living on campus I always went home on weekends.

I have a great boyfriend, and great friends that I’ll be closer to distance wise once I go back living at my dad’s. However I still feel extremely alone. As a teenager I battled pretty bad depression, and I feel defeated with it being back. I’m at a point in life where I have many things most people would want, and yet I’m constantly  feeling terrible, having thoughts of suicide, and I’m tempted to resort back to self harm. I’m not sure how to come out of this. I’ve explained pretty vaguely to my mom about how I feel about everything and her reassurance just isn’t enough. 

I feel like she doesn’t understand because she’s not the one being left behind. 

Am I being dramatic? Are my feelings understandable? How do I win this battle with yet another round of depression and suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm?

If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d appreciate any advice on how to handle this, and how to gain back some control and not let my depression completely swallow me whole.

Thank you."
I wish I could be a functional adult.,6,ml1g3q,2,"Title is kinda self explanatory. I'm halfway through my twenties, which are supposed to be great and fun and adventurous, but instead I feel like I'm just letting it slip by. I spend my days off from work in bed and I only get up to shovel unhealthy food into my mouth. My apartment is filthy and I want it to be clean so desperately, but when I sit down to get started I'm just disgusted by myself. Everyone else around me seems so much more put together, even though I know everyone has their own struggles-- it just feels like I'm the grossest person in the room at any given moment. I muster up enough energy to take good care of my cat, since I don't want her to be unhappy because of me, but every time I want to turn that sort of care towards myself I just can't. It almost feels childish, and I'm ashamed that I can't be a functional adult; that I'm just wasting my life doing what feels like nothing.

I think about when I was a little girl and I was so excited to be an adult, and it fills me with even more shame. That little girl would be so grossed out by the person I am now. Now that I'm older and ""supposed"" to be functional, I'm almost embarrassed thinking about the high hopes I used to have. At this point in my life, I feel like I'll never develop the skills to be a clean, organized, and functional person. 

It just bums me out. Anyone else feel the same?"
First appointment?,1,ml1b3s,2,"What was your first appointment like with behavior/mental health? How about the follow up appointments?

You stop feeling the cuts at some point,1,ml12w1,0,"I accidentally stabbed my hand while cooking dinner today and felt nothing. The blood was pouring onto the counter and floor but I just looked at it as if it was a tiny scratch. I sound emo as hell typing this, but it truly amazes me. 

I guess it's not to hard to understand how people like me can like the feeling, too. The only actual feeling I get from it was a head numbing dizzyness, which is so nice. For that moment of ecstasy everything feels nice. 

Yesterday, at work, I decided to cut myself too. They put me on self check out alone, while also making me fill the machine with money, which takes an excruciating long time. Though I still had to tend to customers and run around with this money in hand in a tiny bowl. To no ones surprise, I dropped it. Thankfully I was able to pick each coin up, but god was that time spent on the floor so humiliting and embarrassing. No matter what I tried to do to calm myself after words didn't work, so I decided to just take my knife out in my car and slice my side. Again, it doesn't really feel like anything anymore, but it stops the ringing in my head to be somewhat bearable. It made the rest of the work day okay atleast.

Efexor XR withdrawal,1,ml0yg2,2,"Also known as venlafaxine, venlablue and venlalic as well as many others.

I started taking this about 7/8 years ago. At first it really helped me. I didn't get any initial side effects. 

I've been trying to come off of it for at least three years due to the absolutely horrific side effects when I go into withdrawal. They present themselves within a day. Alternate days and fast tapering don't work.

I have sleep paralysis, extreme disassociation, vomiting, shaking, uncontrollable crying. I only remember some of these instances. My partner tells me the rest. I couldn't get my meds for three days once and don't remember it. Withdrawal from this drug is terrifying.

I'd like to hear other experiences with this medication.

online school is taking so fucking much out of me. ive struggled with my depression for a long time now, having it since i was eleven years old (im 16 now,) but being online for highschool is just making it so much worse. i'm a good student, i have a 4.0 gpa and im an active member or multiple clubs, even leading my own. to my teachers, i probably look like i'm doing great, but on the inside i feel like i'm about to crumble. i can't do any of my assignments without feeling like i'm going to have a fucking stroke from all of the stress. just doing basic shit in class, like paying attention for the whole period, brushing my teeth before class, getting dressed and paying attention take *everything* out of me. on a good day, i wake up 20 or so minutes before class and maybe wash up a bit, and then go to class on my phone, not paying much attention. on a bad one, i miss multiple periods because i accidentally slept in and i feel like shit about myself for the rest of the day. 

the state of my attitude towards school is making me so angry. i used to be a student who was excited to learn and to do my best, but now school is just about maintaining my stupid fucking grades. i feel like i'm going insane. 

the reason that im spiraling right now is because there's an essay that i'm supposed to be writing that i just can't, for the fucking life of me, seem to get fucking finished. it's making me so angry and depressed because English is the subject that comes easiest to me and the one that i ace all of the time. now, i just can't seem to do anything.

aside from school, my fucking body image has been horrible lately. i'm an athlete that plays competitively, and i want to play D1 one of these days. so many of the girls on my team, girls i follow who play my sport on Instagram and just people on Instagram have perfect bodies. i know that you shouldn't compare people's bodies online to your own, but i'm a teenager and i can't really help it. i got rid of tiktok and Instagram, two apps that were really making it bad, but i still can't escape these thoughts. i just hate my body. i wish i was skinnier and i wish i had a flat stomach. when i look into the mirror i always think, ""there's a skinnier person in there that could get out if you weren't so lazy! get off your ass!"" 

  
it's really awful. there's also the fact that i'm an athlete that makes it worse. i'm pretty good at my sport, but i could be incredible if i worked harder and i know that. i could be a star if i just tried harder, but i'm just lazy and i feel like i can't get up and take the steps that there are to get there. i never want to do cardio. i don't want to do conditioning. i just lay in my bed, go on my computer, find ANY excuse not to do what i'm supposed to. i feel like im just letting myself down but i have no fucking clue how to fucking stop this cycle. i want out so badly.   


i don't have very many friends. i have 3 close ones. one of them lives across the country so i don't get to see them very often. the other one i don't go to school with but live near by. they've had depression, too, so they kinda know what it feels like, but i feel like i can never really have these conversations with them. they most they can say is ""sorry,"" which i understand and don't hold against them since not everyone handles venting and deep talks well. the same goes for my last friend. they're absolutely lovely and i'm so glad to have them in my life, but i would feel uncomfortable if i ever vented to them about my mental health because i honestly just don't want to be a burden to them. 

&#x200B;

i wonder a lot what my life would be like if i didn't have depression. how much more i would be able to get done. how much better my life would be. how i would be able to meet my potential. i wonder that so much as i lie around and do absolutely nothing. i just want to give up sometimes.

do you relate to anything i've said? does it make any type of sense? i don't know. thank you for reading and i hope you have a nice day."
How do I deal with these people,2,ml0sdq,1,"People that I know constantly ignore me, hurt me, bash me, etc... Yet when I try to ignore them and do my own thing they don't just stop or get bored of me, they suddenly act all super friendly and bug the hell out of me and try to joke with me and ask what's wrong and try to be all helpful and crap. It's annoying that nearly everyone I know does this. They're all two-faced. My bullies, acquaintances, ""friends"", etc... Hell even my own family does this to me sometimes. I want to just tell them all to leave me along but I don't know how to do this without sounding like an ass. Any advice?

I'm tired of them making me feel like crap and then getting special treatment to get yoyo'd around emotionally for whatever their reasons are."
Always Alone: People claim to care but don’t.,1,ml0qx8,0," Basically I live, work, and exist by myself for days if not weeks at a time. 

No one reaches out to check in and see if I’m okay; it’s always done when I reach out.

But it’s so exhaustive to reach out and constantly be the “on” person, the entertainer. No one checks in. It’s always my job. If people cared like I do, shouldn’t they be proactively reaching out?

I’m dead inside and everyone assumes I’m fine. But if they knew the truth and talked to me, it’s like the complete opposite.it’s like

I’m so perpetually alone. I can’t do anything social and I live, work, and come home alone.

I try to reach out to my friends and those I like to spend with but no response.

I’m only happy at night,1,ml0q4k,3,"I only have energy when it’s dark outside. The sun makes me want to sleep. When I use the bathroom in the middle of the night, I’ll keep the lights off. I like everything to be dark and more low key.

Parental Problems and Teen Depression,2,ml0kjw,0,"I’m a 15 yo boy and I’ve been struggling with depression for a few years now. When I tried to discuss this with my parents they just said that it’s probably just the age that I’m at and acted like it wasn’t even a problem. My parents also have completely different views on how I should live my life as I believe that the best way to go about my life to to try to be as happy as possible and in the future to earn enough to support a family. My parents believe that the most important thing in life is hard work and only care about me getting a good job and not a job I enjoy. Because of this they have really pushed me to get good grades which I’m fine with, I do feel great accomplishment from doing well in school, but for some reason they can’t grasp the concept that it really takes a lot out of me. They are constantly pushing for me to get involved in sports but I do CrossFit twice a week and am quite healthy. They say it will help because doing sports looks good on my record but doing good in school takes so much out of me that I can’t bring myself to get involved in other activities. I also struggle in social situations and don’t have many friends. I don’t hang out with the friends I do have that often. A big reason for this is that last summer my parents forced me to take up a landscaping job that mostly included sprinkler installation for a small company my dad just started. I had to work 20-25 hours a week so I didn’t have much time to spend with my friends and sense the start of the school year we have been kind of distant. And despite my parents adding to my social skills being difficult they still constantly get mad at me for it. My parents are trying to force me to do landscaping again this summer and no matter what I say they think its what’s best for me. I know that it’s not best for me because last summer I was constantly considering killing myself and I don’t think I can make it through a second time. I haven’t told them about what I’m going through recently because as I mentioned before they just shrugged me off. They also treat me like I’m so immature and don’t just don’t understand anything. This really bugs me as I consider myself pretty mature but just saying that makes me seem like an immature little kid. It seems the only way they would truly believe that what I’m going through is real is killing myself. At this point the only reason I haven’t committed sucked is that I’m just scared of how painful it would be. I know this whole post is lengthy and doesn’t necessarily follow a certain theme but I just want to know what I’m supposed to do in my life.
Please help me, what do I do?"
Wanting to protect my family and friends from hurt can't be enough anymore,2,ml0jqj,0,"For all those reading this - thank you and I am sorry to throw one more heavy post on the pile. 

I've never truly gotten close to real suicidal intention for a variety of reasons. The main one is the ol' ""I couldn't do that to my loved ones"" chestnut and I know I'm not the first to feel this way. 

Lately though, I've realised that this isn't enough anymore.
That preventative check used make me feel safe. Knowing that, for as long as I still cared about the hurt it would cause, I could never do it. 
But now I just feel trapped.
I feel like I'm dying all the time, but I can never actually go. Like my screen has frozen and even the power button won't work.
This sounds clunky and pretentious but, I don't know how else to explain it.

I can't live like this, but I'm terrified that I just *will* any way.
Has anyone else felt this way?"
Life is hard,1,ml0jq8,0,"And i keep hurting myself because apparently nobody gives a fuck about me and I a fucking mistake. Damn even my family hates me, and they don’t even hide it.

Missing myself.,1,ml0i6w,1,"I was a successful professional and had a major depression episode in 2015.

&#x200B;

I've kept two journals throughout four years, without them I would've definitely lost my sanity along with my life. I was never happy with the way I saw myself, physically and mentally. Now I'm just not happy with the way I am mentally. Everything else in life feels hunky dory to me, so why the fUUck is my trauma still shadowing me. Nothing is ever wrong, yet that small voice in my head tells me... ***what if?***

And who’s so far behind in school that he’s gonna fail every class this semester. My life is uneventful and I’ve quit I’ve ever encountered because depression has followed me all my life. This is like my 10th account on Reddit. Because I keep posting and posting shit like this to get some help but honestly nothing has helped me so far. I have a supportive gf but sadly, I’m just depressed and even though she tried to help it doesn’t help. 

I’m looking into therapy but I doubt that will help.
I have six weeks left of college and I know I’m gonna fail all my classes anyways so I’m just giving up and not doing anything for any of my classes now. I want to withdraw classes if I could right now.

My only hobbies are playing guitar and playing video games. I have made videos on YouTube but I don’t wanna dox myself. My guitar playing and singing is mediocre anyways. 

I just feel inferior to everything. I don’t see the point in trying anymore.

I don’t know if I can do this anymore,2,ml0cwr,0,"I don’t even know how to put this in writing but I don’t know where to reach out anymore. I’m tired of battling my head on wanting to end my life I’m tired of fighting off the want to self harm I’m tired of the anxiety that crippled me everyday. I can’t see a future for me and i know everything would be easier if I wasn’t here. I’ve been trying to manage my mental health for over 15 years and I’ve come to the tipping point. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue last year and cannot not work, I’m in so much debt I can’t even pick up the calls to try and work out payment plans, I’m currently on Centrelink but the money isn’t much as I pay for my medications. Over the last year of Covid and lockdowns I lost my job, my grandparents, helping my partner become sober and trying to deal with this chronic pain. Last month I found out I was pregnant but because of my poor health and money issues my partner and I knew the right step was a termination as we wouldn’t be able to provide a home ready for a child and this has broken me, I feel like I can’t hold on anymore I don’t see the happiness in the world anymore and I just want it to be over but the thought of hurting the ones I love makes it harder this battle in my head is killing me. I don’t think I’ll never be rid of my suicidal thoughts. I hate myself, I hate that I can’t work and I can’t get a hold on paying debt. I’m just scared of failing to commit suicide again because last time I failed and my family really held in against me.
I don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t want to keep being a burden to my partner and I know I would be better off not living anymore"
Don’t know how much more I can take,1,ml0ab3,0,"Since posting this I seriously can’t take much more of it. I’ve been on meds for a few weeks, the last close person to me has messed with my head big time and now with everything else factoring into place I just can’t. I’ve been going through this for 8 years, I’ve attempted the easy way out in the past and since then nothing has really gotten any better. I don’t feel anything. If anything feelings wise I feel alone. I have tried talking to numerous of people about it including family and I still don’t feel any better. I am numb to the point where I can’t cry anymore. I know I’m not happy deep down but I can’t express emotions like that anymore. I’m more irritated and a part of me has started thinking of the easy way out as in what if I do this and do that. I want to be ok again, I want to be happy, why can’t I be happy? Seriously I’ve had enough. I can’t be close to someone without feeling like I’m a burden or I’m just a “second choice”. Just for once I want to be happy again, just to feel something more than this loneliness or worthlessness. I couldn’t care less if I slipped off my motorbike and hit something at high speed. I just want this demon to go away one way or another.

I’ve kept secrets of things in my past to myself because I know no one would ever believe me and society won’t see it the way another man would view it. I had a toxic relationship in the past, both  mentally and now when I think about it physically. After a certain amount of time I was being told “we are having s*x” whether I was tired or not that didn’t matter. She has a “split personality” and used it to her excuse to force herself on top of me and try to you know what. That was until someone walked in the room and she pretended to be knocked out on the couch and say “what happened?” To later say her split personality came out. It was later mentioned that she potentially cheated on me more than 100 times, she tried to get people to beat me up and murder me. She lied about being a gang leader, made up fake deaths and pretended to be a member and using someone’s pictures on Facebook just to talk through them. She got me into a street fight with her ex who she cheated on me with (1 of them) stole more than £3000 off me and turned everyone of my mates against me and now I have very few people in my life.

That’s just tip of the ice berg that has lead me to this point. I just want to be ok. I want to be able to trust people and just be more but I can’t take much more of it. The numbness and bad days are taking over and I want it to stop."
I can't breathe,1,ml0a3t,1,"This has been going on for a couple weeks. It feels like I'm on the edge of a cliff, like I'm holding my breath for the plunge. I feel as though it is the start of a panic attack but it never comes on fully. It's so tiring and demoralizing. My depression rages on.

I have spots of very good positivity in my life right now and I can totally appreciate them and it ""helps"" though the depression still continues. All I can do right now is cry and gasp for breath.

I have a few friends and family but even when I'm around them it doesn't change it, I can make a happy face but I never really feel happy and the few times I do it dissapears quickly. I just want to know what you redditors think. Is being this lonely something I should go talk more about or something I should reach out for. I really don't want to talk to like doctors if possible.

Then they just don’t know what to say , or get hurt 

Or they just say something that triggers a specific topic I thought about much the last time ( that’s why I’m already unstable) and I just can’t think about what the said in the most negativst way possible ( my brain just make me seem like  the grossest , weak  , fucked up loser ever about what they said related to that topic ) , 
anf they end up seeing how “down “ sad , silent etc I am and blame themselves for that.
And then I‘m the one who feels shitty about it all and the over dramatic reaction of my brain to every shit .

Also it’s just more or less the same issues that repeat themselves and are triggered by some events or I just thought about more the last time.

Does it matter anymore living? I will get the same conclusion, ""take care, be happy "" People give me blunt advice that won't help me a bit.  Why nights suck? Never found the answer but their own analogy.

I have a plan out, multiple actually and I spend every day wishing I wasn’t here. I’ve completely stopped taking care of myself and just don’t care.

"I think my [22F] boyfriend [26M] is depressed and I don't know how to deal with it, he doesn't want to seek help or talk about his emotions. I'm getting a bit desperate. What should I do?",3,mkziha,3,"I have been in a beautiful loving relationship for the past 2 years with someone that constantly shows he loves me and demonstrates respect towards me and our relationship. As a person that has been diagnosed with depression, I can notice the symptoms quicker than most people. My boyfriend spends most of his days feeling beyond exhausted and unmotivated, sleeps during most of his free time and as soon as he leaves work (he has a nine to five full time job), he always feels like ""he's not that special"" and constantly diminishes how amazing of a human being he can be. Due to covid restrictions I have not been able to see him for months because we are simply not allowed to travel, and he just keeps getting worse since he has been isolated and isolating himself from the world. He barely has any motivation to do anything, and pretty much has not left his place in months, unless it is for 5 seconds to go take out the trash.

I try to talk to him every day but there are days where we do not even facetime because he is already asleep at 6pm, and I just keep getting more concerned. He only talks about his emotions when we have strong arguments after his feelings build up and even then, I feel like he has a lot of trouble expressing himself, and it makes conflict resolution way more complicated than what it could be. I try to respect his boundaries and not confront him with things that make him uncomfortable, but usually he simply brushes my questions off with an ""I'm just tired"", and never wants to talk about what is really going on.

I have been doing therapy for some time now and I believe it has helped me a lot when it comes to communicating my feelings and understanding what I am going through inside my head. I strongly believe it could help him too.

I am aware that this is something that cannot be forced. I have tried, more than once, and unsuccessfully, to talk to him about it and make him see that he should not be embarrassed about going to therapy and that it is important to talk to someone about how we feel – that this someone does not have to be me, and that it would be good if that someone was a person that knew what to say and how to help him.

He says he just does not think it is necessary, and that I need to stop mentioning it (his responses make me feel like me saying therapy could help him attacks his sense of “masculinity” a bit). Where I come from, there is a strong feeling against therapists and a culture of ignoring mental issues since it is seen as a weakness to “need” to see a therapist – I feel like this could be something stopping him too.

I know he has had a bad experience after few sessions with a terrible therapist growing up, and this helped him lose faith in this method of healing. Knowing that he does not talk to anyone about his feelings makes me worry a lot.

A few months ago we had a conversation with a friend in common, and my boyfriend admitted to us that he thought maybe he did need therapy after the things he went through in his life – I found him some therapist recommendations afterwards through my therapist, but when I talked to him about it a few days later he got upset and said he didn’t really mean it, and that he doesn’t want to spend money on something “he doesn’t need”.

Since he has been spending his time isolated due to restrictions and cannot see other people, I cannot help but be more and more concerned about his mental well-being. I do not want to be annoying or upset him, I just wanted him to do something that could help him heal. It did not have to be therapy, that is just the suggestion I give him – because it is the only thing I know that helps deal with these terrible feelings.

I fear what might happen to him or to our relationship if he does not seek help.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? How can I support him and help him, knowing I can’t be physically there for him and that our online contact is slightly compromised by his constant need to sleep? Should I keep mentioning therapy, or is that too invasive at this point?

Thank you in advance for any advice 😊."
I’m tired of questioning if I’m lovable despite my mental illness.,6,mkzhgj,1,"I want to KNOW that I’m loveable. I want to experience what it feels like to know that you’re loved. But I’m still alone. Never dated, and don’t feel safe with most friends - and I’m afraid that it will always be this way."
Just a note.,4,mkzgcj,2,"Maybe writing this will help me. But it probably won't. I've always wanted to write a suicide note. 

I cry myself to sleep now. I want to every night. Because no matter how hard I try, I'm still me at the end of the day. I'm everything I hate. I'm selfish and ugly. I'm hateful, and depressing, and petty. I'm a trauma survivor, but I don't feel like I survived. I feel like my heart's been slowly shredded with a machete. Every possible friendship I could have I ruin, because I'm trash. Everyone was right to call me trash. Because that's what I am. 

I don't want to hurt anyone but I feel like I'm drowning in sorrow. I'm so lonely. God I'm so lonely. 

The only way I feel like I can be free is if I die. Nothing is fixing this. I hate getting up in the morning. I hate seeing myself in the mirror. I'm in agony. I'm so utterly alone on this planet. I feel like a monster. 

I'm sorry I even ever existed. I'm sorry for it all. I'm sorry."
Went to a Psychiatrist today,2,mkzdg6,3,"I'm 58 and have lost many jobs over the years. I fear I will lose my current teaching job because of my lack of classroom management skills and anger that arises from the worst of student behaviors. There are lots of current stressors and childhood trauma that followed me into adulthood because of my father's alcoholism and depth into his own depression.

I didn't want to pay the $200 but I'm glad i went today. He adjusted my meds (Venlafaxine 225mg), and assured me that I wasn't narcissistic and that I shouldn't pursue disability, among other things. Maybe he can work through some situations with me that will help me with my anger. He did agree that students are very difficult these days, but there's a lot of stress for them and their family.

Just my two cents. I'm fortunate I can pay the fees."
Losing weight too fast.,2,mkz6lz,0,"Its been such a struggle to eat lately. It really sucks. I try to work out 6 days a week, but I don't think it's doing much. I've been eating like a bowl of spinach, boiled egg, and mozzarella every day because it's quick and easy. I really feel full all day after that. Probably causing a lot of my suffering."
What is wrong?,1,mkz5e5,3,"My life is great, I can't find a REAL reason to feel sad about it.... the only thing is that I went through divorce 2 years ago.. but even before that I was questioning my happiness all the time,

I am beautiful, I am really good in my profession, have my own company, 1 degree, 2 masters degrees, great friends, stable family, have traveled a lot, in my 20's..., I always manage to get what I want, and STILL I AM NOT HAPPY is never enough, and lately is worse and worse.... for the last two years was really bad and I blamed the divorce but now I am with someone new and HE IS GREAT, AMAZING! but still, I am sad and still, there is days where I am not productive at all, I just stay in bed all day,.. and still I accomplish a lot being like this still I manage to keep business up, go on amazing adventures etc because i have this UPS : Where I do A LOT and everything is great ,,, then COMPLETELY DOWN.. FOR DAYS.... AND IS  when no one is around I sink into my sadness thinking like there are two versions of me, I already reached out to the psychiatrist and of course I was recommended to take antidepressants but I am not sure, I know I have nothing lose but... I also don't want to use my last resource what if this doesn't help? what is next? I have already been in therapy before and I feel like is not enough,,, I just don't know anymore... I even try going to church to see if is my spirit that is broken?

anyone can relate?

I would love to hear that I am not the only one....."
Can't sleep and need to get stuff off my chest,1,mkz4zn,0,"Hi everyone, sorry to bother. It's late and my brain is not letting me sleep, so i want to try to write some shit out and mybe get a clear mind at least for this night. I wrote something, but deleted most of it because I felt like I will just bore everyone who reads this, so i will try to keep myself short. 
I'm dealing with a lot of selfhate mainly. I feel like a failure, I never accomplished anything in my life. I have no talents that'd help me get a job I like, or a job in general. I even get rejected for jobs to fill in shelves. In every school and every class I was, people never wanted to be friends with me, doesn't matter how hard I tried, but many of them liked to pick on me for whatever reason. I tried to change my attitude in hopes that people wouldnt bully me when they meet me, but it never worked. Late at night I think about it and wonder how others perceive me and what made me the target of their actions. I have little to no self confidence anymore, I just hate myself so much. I feel like I am never enough for anyone. I have friends that love me as much as I love them, also a caring boyfriend, but I still feel like I'll dissapoint them and that I dont deserve them. I feel so bad for them because they do everything for me, but I still can't fucking be happy. I feel so ungrateful. Every little stressful situation in my life makes me do selfharming im form of cutting and ripping my eyebrows out. I started cutting at the beginning of this year and it makes me hate myself even more. I just want the pain to end, but im too much of a coward to end it, which is good i guess. I was thinking about going to therapy, but I feel like people got it worse than me and that I shouldn't take a spot for people who truly need it. Some days I just feel so empty, sick of myself. I dissapoint so many people, I can't take it anymore. I don't have a plan for the future, I dont know what to do with myself and yet im so scared of the future. I want to life, but I hate myself so much that it makes it unbearable sometimes.
So yeah, I think that's it for now, sorry if it bored you guys. I just needed to vent for a bit, have a lovely day."
I really don’t know what I’m doing anymore.,2,mkz4d0,1,"My girlfriend dumped me a month ago with no reason, she just said she didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. I’ve been posting on the r4r subs and when I do get a response I usually get ghosted quickly after. I just want these feelings of loneliness to go away. 

I just lay in bed all day and wish I had someone to talk to. FML I just wish I was dead."
I get depressed when I don’t have school,1,mkz3eu,0,"Whenever I have a break like spring break or summer I start to get really depressed. After school starts again I stop. I think it’s either the lack of interaction with other people, my family, or maybe schools keeps me out of my own head. I’m wondering if anyone else feels this way"
Stuck in the mud,1,mkz3e6,0,"I loathe people who casually throw around ""I love you."" You're a cunt in the moment to some who've never had that shit. It's a palpable emotion for me, I WILL love you to death, so when you split in my hard times, I wanna set myself on fire because I feel emotionally cucked for a moments respute and weed... I hate people."
"Ok I feel like there's no hope to get ""better"". Sometimes I just want to give up.",4,mkz1eh,1,"The only thing that keep me alive is my family which is supportive to me. And... I made a promise that I won't do it but sometimes I feel overwhelmed and just wanna end this suffering. Sometimes I feel also that maybe there will be better time for me but idk what to think about it. My head is full of many thoughts, I feel like I can't just chill, relax, regenerate. I hate everyone and everything but also I want someone who can ""save"" me. But whats the point of it all? I dont even care rn. Peace"
It's gotten to the point where there is not a single thing in life I enjoy.,107,mkywpi,36,"99.9% of everything I do bores the living shit outta me at best or is a tedious chore at worst. Novels, movies, series, Internet, YouTube... you name it. It probably bores me to tears. I'm so bored, it's excruciating. Every second of everyday I stare at a blank screen or the walls or the ceiling. I desperately try to find something to pull me out of this agonizing ennui. It rarely works. 

I think I'm terminally bored at this point. Life sucks. Everything sucks. I hate everything about life. There is genuinely not a single thing that makes life worth living. All I feel everyday is the inevitable march to the slaughterhouse. And I'm not scared. I'm just... bored and so underwhelmed. Sometimes bitterly disappointed. Sometimes angry. But mostly just bored out of my goddamn mind."
How to deal with having a bad personality,3,mkyvj2,0,i constantly hate the way i act and always put myself down in public and have created a horrible image of myself. how do i deal with the fact that i obviously have a bad personality as all my friends have left me and no guy has ever showed any interest in me even though i am (relatively)attractive i think. i don’t know how to fix this please help me i am very lost and alone. any tips on how to change my personality and create a better reputation for myself are much needed. at this point i think i just have to move to a new city where everyone doesn’t think i’m a stupid brain dead druggy whore even though i literally never have sex.
I give up...,2,mkyv2a,2,"Ain’t even got the energy to type. I just don’t see the point anymore. Everyone around me is moving forward and I’m just in the same position as I was 4 years ago. 

Lockdown really has just increased this feeling. 

See ya folks."
"Do people really get over depression, or will I just live with it till I die?",2,mkyuun,11,"Long story short I made a plan to end my life after my parents pass to save them the grief. Obviously this is assuming that I still feel the same way when I'm 30-50, but seeing how my feelings haven't changed the past 7 years, will I ever not wanna kill myself?

Someone told me on here aswell that depression never leaves you just have to face it, that kinda sucks ass? I mean I use videk games, youtube, anime and whatnot to help distract myself but, will I have to do that everyday basically till I die? If thats the truth, I salute you people who are over the age of 25 and still have the will to go on."
Depression and in a relationship?,1,mkytnj,1,I’m curious if there’s anyone 30+ that suffers from depression and in a successful relationship. I feel like I’m just never going to have one and would love to hear some positive stories from people that are in a relationship.
Why Does It Feel I'm Never 'Lucky' Enough to Die?,2,mkys19,0,"Well, you probably know how this goes, since I'm posting here rather than on Ask Reddit or some other more positive forum or community.

But regardless, I feel like I need somewhere to rant about life, my situation, and the feeling that it's completely hopeless right now, so here goes.

Basically, I've been depressed for what feels like months at this point, and the pandemic has only made it worse by giving me near endless time to think about my life and situation. Every day is the same, and everything just feels more and more hopeless every time.

A large part of the reason for this is twofold. I feel like I always end up struggling alone in everything, unable to get help or fit in, and completely lack the emotional depth needed to really connect with other people.

In terms of the former, it's a case of being stuck alone every time. Every project I work on ends up being something I end up forced to do alone, without any help from others regardless of who I ask or when. Every personal problem has to be tackled alone, with no seeming way to communicate my feelings to anyone let alone get them to understand why I feel that way.

And even when people are seemingly supportive, the same applies. People will agree with me in private, but never in public (and tell the opposite story to anyone else to make themselves look good). I'll get endless amounts of praise for things I showcase online, yet no one will ever show the same sort of interest other such works get, in the sense of being willing to actually help out.

It's true of everything.  Having trouble at work? No one helps or offers to. Getting attacked on social media? Everyone stays quiet, even the people who tell me in private that they agree with what I'm saying. 

Exacerbating this is the sheer difficult I seem to have when it comes to making friends, or developing any real sort of connection with anyone else. I can talk to them, but it never feels that personal or friend like. Similarly, it feels like while I can participate in a community or group, I can never feel like part of it either. I'm just always stuck as the outsider, the lone individual unable to fit in anywhere.

It makes me wonder why I even exist. Why live when you can't connect to others and when you may as well live the life of a medieval hermit rather than a functional member of society.

But that's all just irrelevant background stuff. What really depresses me is the feeling that I can't just be... 'lucky' enough for it to end. I can't just have some illness or accident finally end things for me, in a way that seems perfectly normal and natural.

Like I would love to just have a few weeks to live or not survive after an unfortunate event occurred. It'd provide some sort of closure, and take responsibility away.

Yet it never happens. It feels like that only happens for those who have something to live for, who matter on this planet and who'd be missed by others. The stories are always of some hopeful with a long happy life ahead of them dying tragically, never some miserable soul getting the rest they actually want.

Is the universe not letting it happen because it wouldn't be tragic enough? Am I being kept here because it's 'fun' to watch the struggles continue week after week, month after month?

It makes me look back at the near misses (like the time I was hit by a car and just walked it off), and wonder why it couldn't have just gone the other way.

But yeah, that's just how I keep feeling at the moment. Sorry for ranting too much, and I hope everyone else has had a good day at least."
Content this evening.,1,mkylmm,0,"I've finally felt an inkling of serotonin, *yaaaay*...it seems like another mood swing, though. Hum."
I romanticize suicide in my head,21,mkylih,3,"I've always been kind of fascinated with the idea of suicide and this is going to sound awful but I find (fictional) stories of suicide a little comforting? Like it's not that uncommon, it's human, other people think about it too. I guess in consequence I tend to romanticize it a bit, Sorrows of Young Werther style..I know it's unhealthy but I'm just always drawn to it."
Depression makes everything so pointless,1,mkyko5,0,"Why is life so unfair. What is a life without happiness? To me, without happiness, love, joy, awe, bliss, etc life cannot be life. To me it can't be a life well lived which makes me feel so horrible. I know life isn't only happy feelings but i am literally NEVER happy. Why.... Even if i met the girl of my dreams tomorow i'd probably just ghost her due to being so depressed. Not like that would happen though. Im beyond undesireable, i'll be alone forever. Been undesired my whole life. I feel like I have a curse on me. Even at school I was always the odd one out, never fit in anywhere in my damn life, and if I ever did for a short amount of time I always ruined it. I will try more medication soon , but I truly don't think anything can help me. I feel so damn hopeless man. I feel pyschedelics also ruined my brain, like i think it did permament damage but i was depressed for that. Been depressed waaayy too long man. I don't have energy or care to change my life."
How do you change when there’s no hope?,1,mkyjt5,0,"I just don’t know how to help myself or even ask for help.  50, divorced after 20 years.  I found love completely accidentally and managed to ruin that relationship after a short 6 months.  Now i have nothing left, zero reserves.  

I know people are just trying to help but saying things like “try new things, do things you enjoy, love yourself before looking for love...”. None of that is helpful.  How do i love myself if I’m completely alone.  I’m not talking about not having a significant other, i am talking about zero friends, zero contact outside of work.

I could die at home and not be missed for at least a week.  Literally and completely isolated.  I just can’t see any way forward.  After my divorce i was almost in this spot and found love 5 months later.  Now thinking about going through the heart ache and soul wrenching agony again is more than i can bear.  

I don’t even know why I’m writing this.  When does life become too much?  Why continue struggling when there’s less hope every day?"
Nobody can fix me. I can’t fix myself. I wish I were never born,1,mkx29s,2,
I feel like I'm not cut out for this life.,3,mkygl9,1,"I just feel so weak. I graduated at the end of 2019, worked until summer 2020 where I had to stop due to covid. After months of job searching (and months of my dad telling me over and over again to find a job, even though I was trying!) I finally landed a job. And a week in, I already want to quit. 

It isn't even a ""hard"" job - I'm working as a counselor at a dog daycare where you clean and maintain the yards, as well as manage the dogs in the yards (upwards of 25 large dogs at a time, on your own). Since starting I'm tired all of the time (even though my longest shift so far was only 6 hours), as it is draining work, and I also feel like I'm not a good fit for it. I don't have that dominant, ""head of the pack"" vibe and whenever things get hectic I start feeling very anxious and sorta freeze up. But I spent so long getting a job, and all of my friends and family are happy for me, so I feel like I have to toughen up and deal with it. I just don't have the motivation or energy for it all.

At the same time, I constantly find myself thinking that a future where I spend almost all of my time working isn't what I want. Having to work 8-9 hours a day, 5-6 days a week for the rest of my life sounds like hell. I could barely function mentally (I have depression and anxiety) working the 35-40 hours I would before the pandemic hit. I don't know how I can do it for the rest of my life.

And don't even get me started on not being able to find the motivation to do anything because the world is falling apart and turning to shit as we know it. What's the point if we're basically already past the ""point of no return"" for climate change? Or that if I were to drop dead, any modern employer would have an ad for my now vacant position before my body turned cold.

This ended up longer and more rambly than I intended. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, any words of encouragement or advice would be greatly appreciated."
I feel broken,5,mkyfbo,2,"I'm a 23 male and I feel broken. I'm sad all the time. I don't want to talk to anyone when somebody talk to me I get really angry (but I don't show it). And I feel something inside me is broken. When I try to have fun it don't work I don't enjoy it. My brain or body say lay in bed I am tired. I don't know how to describe it. 

What my friends and family think is that I am happy and a good person and funny. But behind my face I am a broken man for almost 1 to 2 year. I can't sleep eat or enjoy things and it is killing me. I am now at the point what is life is it really worth it. 

And I think it has to do with my past and it is hunting me when I try to run away. Because I don't want to face it. I live in another world in my head to escape from reality.

I am really lost if someone can give advice I really appreciate."
I’m so out of it. I can’t even do any productive.,5,mkyf9j,3,"My assignments are legit piling up and I can’t even start them. I’m so out of it. I can’t think. I feel so numb but not completely numb cause I still care about school. I feel like I’m loosing myself. I just want to sleep and not wake up. I don’t want to give up, but I can feel myself giving up. My life is all downhill and my anxiety isn’t helping any of this. FUCK DEPRESSION.

There's only one person that motivates me to keep living,1,mkyc5p,0,"My mental health has always been shit, but these past three years have been one of a pain in the ass. I am hopeless, I can't see myself living in the future (sometimes I get the feeling that they want me gone for good). My family doesn't care about my current mental state and has made it crystal clear multiple times. I used to have some friends in real life but I pretty much lost contact with them (we met at college, some of them left and some others are now 1 year behind me and I've lost complete contact with them). I wasn't the closest to them in the first place so I don0t know if it's appropriate for me to tell them about what I've been going through.

The only person that seems to care about my existence is someone I've known for 2 years: my only internet friend. She doesn't know I am struggling, but whenever I talk to her I feel like there's hope for me, that life it's worth living. She's a dear friend I want to see grow and succeed in life, and that inspires me to keep going. 

Life is a piece of shit, but it's less shit when I remember she exists. If I kill myself she will never know why I stopped texting her."
I don’t know what is wrong with me,1,mkybwm,0,"Life wasn’t always OK, but it seems to be doing alright at the moment. My attempt was 5 years ago. The last time I self-harmed was 3 years ago. It’s about to be a year since I visited a psychiatrist and CBD (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) worked out very well. I’m pretty sure I have moved on from my ex-boyfriend and best friend; I am fine with being single since the past few years and my night terrors regarding my assault and harassment stopped too. My relations with my family and with faith are much, much better. 

I have everything yet I have this gnawing sense that something is about to go wrong. That I don’t deserve everything going right and I should spiral back, lose control and sabotage everything and anything I have. I can’t seem to focus, I can’t seem to sleep at all, and when I do fall asleep I don’t want to wake up. I physically can NOT wake up if I do fall asleep. My grades were doing very well in the past few months but we are in lockdown again and now they’re spiralling. I don’t even have an answer to what’s wrong and who is to blame... at least my problems before had a pointer. What in the hell am I supposed to do with myself at this point? Why can’t I just be happy? Why can’t I just heal and get over it all? Why does it all come back every night?"
i can't sleep but not because of my insomnia,2,mkyb5x,0,"these last days are a nightmare to me, my best friend is suicidal and i feel very very bad for her.

I'm stressed and as a result, i don't eat much,it's becoming very hard. i'm also very anxious. i don't know what to do at this point, i need help.

she doesn't respond since 10:14 pm and it's 1:44 am right now

i hope she didn't do it but at the same time she's living with a friend since a week because we don't know what she can do so she must have done nothing

i called her over 20 times and i can't stay calm"
Heartbroken and Depressed,2,mky8ed,4,"I've (24M) dealt with depression for most of my life. Mental health issues run in the family. I currently go to therapy but am unmedicated. 

I've also been going through the worst heartbreak of my life. My 4 year relationship ended officially a few months ago after a year-long back and forth breakup. It broke me. I'm the most depressed I've ever been, feeling so hopeless. I was completely in love with him. We lived together, did so many things together. He opened my world to so many experiences and people that I never would've experienced without him. I've been feeling this loss for quite a few months now. Unfortunately I don't have much of a support system. I live at home and unemployed and am quite friendless. I have one close friend but he lives quite far away now and he deals with his own mental health issues.   
The worst part is the day-to-day. I don't have much at all to distract myself or anyone to be around to help me heal from this. Even if I get an opportunity to do something, I'm too depressed to do it. So i mostly just sit on my bed and cry all day. I've tried taking up working out at home to help release endorphins but i find it hard to get the motivation.   
He was the best thing I ever had in my life - he made me want to live it. But I lost him and I'm trying to find myself again. Just sucks when you don't have much to do to distract yourself from the pain. I cry a lot. More than I ever did before.

I've considered going on SSRIs again to help me improve my mood, but my last experience on them was a bit traumatizing. My first dose of Zoloft and I had a full blown panic attack. Ended up in the ER because I had no idea what was happening to me. Stopped immediately but it took a long while for the panicky feelings to subside. I tried Prozac a little while after but stopped after 3 days because I was scared of the panic attacks happening again. It sucks that a side effect of SSRIs is increased anxiety. I already have enough anxiousness, I don't need more. Especially from the meds that are supposed to help.   


I just wish the pain would stop. I've been depressed for so long. I hate it. I want to enjoy my life and I want to live it. Experience everything. The good and the bad. But without the depression. It's exhausting and overwhelming."
Do you ever,1,mky7qb,0,"I'm just going to say it, kill meeee!! I hate being alive!! 

Do you ever have those times you just get so crushed? 
It's not something in particular but it's everything and it's nothing. Like you just want to be free of your mind?"
"Depression has affected my personal and professional life deeply... I wish I had killed myself earlier, honestly.",4,mky7hq,0,"I had thought about suicide ever since I was a child. The earliest I can remember is back to when I was about 11 or 12 years old, then it got worse. 

The point is, I still have it and it’s helped me ruin every small chance I had of being someone in life. I went to a four year college during a period in my life when I thought I could get out and change everything. I was very naive and dumb back then. 

I had many opportunities to succeed economically. But somehow it kicked in. Once I had those opportunities knocking at my door I just didn’t feel like I deserved any of it. And so I would always end up quitting. I ended up homeless and suicidal more than once too. It happens al the time. Every time something good happens to me I push it away because I know that it’s not going to work out, that I don’t deserve it. 

And now, although I went to college, I have a dead end  general labor job that I got through an agency after working as a janitor for a few months for a low paying wage. They recently changed my job duties but I know that they just want to fuck me up with more labor. They know it and I know it. And if they don’t like how I do then they can easily get rid of me and replace me. Because that’s how life is. But at the same time, this job is all I have, it’s all I am now. I think my worst fear now is not having a job because then I’d end up homeless and even more suicidal than before... but at the same time, it represents something I didn’t want to turn into; just a modern slave a miserable servant for others. And this is just how I’m going to die. I’m too old to start again. And the energy I used to have is dead now. I’m just surviving and waiting to die (hopefully soon)."
"So, I did it.",2,mky5l4,0,"See my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/m2y3k5/thinking_of_telling_my_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). So, despite a lack of responses there, I went ahead and sent out the following text via a restricted Facebook post:

""This is not one of those “If YoU cAn ReAd ThIs” copypastas. I wrote this myself, and if you are able to see it, I would appreciate if you would read it. This is not me seeking affirmation or pity. It is me trying to explain what is going on in my head and how it expresses itself outwardly, the best way I can, in a setting I can control.

I have been struggling, mostly in silence, with thoughts and feelings I cannot control. Not just recently, but for years now. I have kept quiet mostly to protect my own stupid pride, which I came to realize is ridiculous. For the most part, my life is nearly perfect, and I should be over the moon for how well things have finally turned out for me. Yet, I occasionally have overwhelming feelings of irritability, sadness, anxiety, fear, inadequacy, self-loathing, and a few others I can’t name. Despite this, I still like to think of myself as a generally happy person who is truly blessed.
  
There are days when I completely shut down mentally and emotionally. Like someone flipped a breaker in my brain, and I (either suddenly or gradually) lose all interest in interacting with any and all other humans. This is particularly painful for me when Brittany or the kids want to tell me about their day, share something they learned, or celebrate an achievement. Beyond that, when there is something happening (a birthday, milestone, etc. external to our household) which I should be excited about. But I’m completely tuned out. Seriously, it hurts, y’all.

Some of you know I have abandonment issues, which thanks to many of you, I have largely overcome. Yet, thoughts linger, which cause complex emotions I can’t begin to describe. I often fear that I am not enough, for any of you. That I’m not living up to expectations. That mistakes I have made in the past (both distant and recent) still dictate my future. Things which I should be able to shrug off and move on from, hang over me like a cartoon thundercloud. Just so we’re clear, this is NOT due to anything that any of you have said or done.

I have been medicated in the past. Do I need to be again? I don’t know. I have had my hormone levels checked, and some are outside of what’s considered normal. And those which are have been attributed to altered emotional states. I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve broken out in ugly sobbing fits for absolutely no reason. I’ve considered therapy, but past experiences have left me quite jaded. But, I may have to put my reservations aside and place my trust in a professional once again to figure this out. Please keep in mind that while this may very well be depression, I am NOT suicidal. I know I have far too much to live for, and frankly, death terrifies me.
   
I have also not been intentionally evasive or rude or disrespectful. If you have taken my actions as such, let me reiterate that some of my actions are dictated by thoughts and emotions I CANNOT control. Communication is one of my worst weaknesses, I don’t call ANYONE nearly as often as I should, and conversation is usually sparse when I do. The lack of contact then compounds the guilt I feel and perpetuates a spiral, causing anxiety about initiating contact after long periods. My social media activity has also drastically declined, and for additional unrelated reasons as well.
  
For the sake of understanding, I should tell you that figuring out how to say this has taken several months. It is being posted here because there is no way I would be able to say this to any of you in person, or over the phone. I have prayed that the words would come, that I could share my quiet pain with you, my family. For your benefit as much as mine.
   
I don’t expect everyone to understand (or even believe) everything I’m saying. And that’s fine, this is solely for me to get this out in the open for those who need to hear it the most. Some of this was very easy to write, while the rest was equally daunting. I changed the visibility settings to allow only those whom I wished to see this, as tagging allows you and everyone you know to see. So please, let others know about this, and if they can’t see it, I’m not comfortable with them knowing about this yet.
  
This has been a long read, and if you’ve made it through, I want to thank you. Thank you also for your love, for your support, for your encouragement over the years. I want you to know that I love you very much, and I’m sorry if my actions (or inactions) have hurt you or damaged my relationship with you. As difficult as this has been to express, I wanted you all to know that I am working on it.""

I got a few very supportive responses, but the ones I really needed to hear, from the people causing my anxiety, were largely quiet. Maybe I screwed up by doing this, but now that I finally had the words, I felt the time was right."
Waking up to zero messages is f*cking bullsh*t,3,mky515,4,"I don't even expect anyone to read this. 

Seeing all the people I know having hundreds of followers on social media while having almost none doesn't seem to be a big deal at first. Having hundreds of followers wouldn't even be something I wanted to show off with BUT all these peoples' followers are the people I know as well. Like, they don't even recognize I exist. 

Seeing them with all their perfect lives makes me f*cking sick. Imagining them waking up to a dozen of people asking them about how they are while not having anyone myself makes me sick.

I don't even get any messages from anyone in months. Nobody cares about me. Oh, and please don't reply with ""You need someone to care about you? You're only able to look after yourself."" I'm sick of answers like this as well."
Can depression cause memory loss?,9,mky3yc,4,My memory is so bad these days that I can't remember most of my childhood and my adolescence. Only fragments of it. I'll rarely get a flashback and it's usually a bad memory. Now I'm forgetting where I place things. I'm finding that I'm misplacing things more often than normal. Can depression destroy my memory or something?
Dealing with family,1,mky370,0,"how do you deal with family when they seem dismissive of you/me getting help?

My dad agreed to let me see a therapist but he also made a point to say that i'm not mentally unwell and that all i need to do is to walk outside in the sun and exercise more. 

My mom and my oldest sister are taking a hands off approach and not really talking to me (not entirely irregular in my family)

and my other sister which i thought i was closest to in the family is taking a supportive yet frustrated/passive aggressive approach which really triggers my guilt sometimes. 

like i understand that 'the formula' for getting out of depression is to eat 3 meals, exercise, see the sun, talk to people, etc. but is it just me being whiny or is it that it's actually a lot harder than it looks. and i get that it's frustrating because i don't talk to my family about my problems but the family dynamic that's understood by me about my family is that no one talks about their emotions like what do they expect. i feel like if it goes to a certain point, i'll seriously break down and my family won't know how to support me other than telling me to shape up. it's so frustrating the way they're treating me and my seeking help"
What is your appetite for risk in Outdoor Recreation activities? [Research],3,mky1kn,2,"Please consider participating in a survey on how people perceive risks associated with outdoor activities.

In particular, I am looking for participants who identify as being affected by depressive disorder or depressive tendencies.

Further information is below. The survey can be found at this link and is for people aged 18 and over:

https://www.research.net/r/PKM230ID11611765  

**Why am I asking this?**

I am teaching the course Social Psychology of Risk offered by Charles Sturt University (Australia) as part of the degree Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation. A whole section of this course is dedicated to the psychological / mental health benefits / sense of empowerment that participants can derive from these activities.

While research has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. Indeed, most people seem to assume that only adrenalin junkies and alpha-fe/males engage in many outdoor adventure recreation activities. To move beyond mere assumptions, I have designed and distributed a survey.

While I have had a good uptake, the numbers of participants who identify as having a disability (in the broadest terms) has been very low. I am very keen change this, as I am hoping to be able to demonstrate that the appetite for risk among people who identify as affected by depressive disorder or depressive tendencies will, in most instances, not be any different from that of any one else.

I strongly believe that members of the subReddit are eminently qualified to comment on their perceptions of risk in outdoor activities.

Can you please consider the survey. It consists of a front end with some general demographic questions and then general attitudes towards Outdoor Recreation activities, followed by questions regarding specific activities. Some of these specific activities require social interaction, others do not.

**Ethics approval**

The survey has been approved by Charles Sturt University's Ethics in Human Research Committee. 

The background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: 

http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html

Participation in the survey is purely voluntary and all responses are anonymous.

**What will happen with the data?**

The survey data will be used by students to design Adventure Outdoor Recreation Programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and I will be using the data to write several research overviews. These will inform the profession and will also inform the training of future outdoor guides, activity leaders and outdoor activity providers. When the analysis is completed, I will be only too happy to report back in this subReddit.

Here is link for the survey again:

https://www.research.net/r/PKM230ID11611765  

Please note that there is no 'right' or 'wrong' answer. It is all about ***your*** ***personal*** perception of risk.

The survey should take about 20-25 min to complete. I am fully aware that it is a complex and detailed questionnaire, and thus its completion requires some time commitment, but I can assure you that this detail is necessary in order to be able to carry out a nuanced analysis.

Mobile device users please be aware that SurveyMonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll horizontally or down as well to see everything. I apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration.

I want to help my friend out as much as I can,1,mky13b,1,"So starting at the beginning of the school year I’ve grown closer and closer to this girl, I’m probably her most closest friend because her friends all have been jerks to her, we also have a bit of a romantic thing going on but nothing official and I’m saying these things because I want to know what I can do to make her feel better, even if it’s for a day or a minute. Last night while we were on ft a wave of depression hit her and she kept saying that she was being so annoying and the worst and that I should just hang up and I kept trying to say things to prove that I do really like her and care about her, cause I do. She then said how no matter how much nice things I say or anything I do her brain won’t let her believe me, I’ve been doing research and trying to understand about her depression because I just want to help her be happy, I do what I can, I listen to her problems and try to offer some help here and there, but I figured I’d come here because if anyone would know how to help her it would be people who are affected themselves, it would be really appreciated on how I can make them feel at least a bit better."
How to stop out of control and lazy,2,mky0xy,0,"I’m so unmotivated and I’m not getting anything done and I can’t stop beating myself up for it. I keep thinking if only I tried harder but it also feels like I just can’t do anything

Suppressing Limitless Hate,2,mkxzgc,3,"I have been been in hell the past 3 months. I became a lunatic. I haven’t slept once since 2 weeks ago, and I hate it. I hate everyone who tries to help because they make it worse. I get evaluated, and then I lose something, whether it be a privilege, or a necessity. I have so much hate, but no ability to calm myself."
"How do people dealing with depression even manage to find lasting relationships, platonically or romantically?",2,mkxulr,1,"I just can't, on the romantic side, I can't look at myself and think ""Yeah, I guess I wouldn't be a bad partner"" when I quite literally lack in the personality and looks department, moreover, sometimes I feel so awful that I start talking about my issues and that is, by all accounts, a red flag and it's when people usually stop talking to me. 

&#x200B;

Likewise, with friends, I feel that I simply have no energy to reply to them most of the times, sometimes I don't even want to talk to anyone, and yet I keep wishing someone would talk to me, which makes it an awful, awful contradiction that I just can't work out. And when I do manage to talk to someone, randomly I will start talking about my problems(See the pattern?) and I HATE when I do that, but truth is, that's all the content I have, I got no passions, no dreams, no hobbies, I just exist, so yeah brain, why do you want to talk to people, when you know I am as boring as they come?"

Lacking motivation to keep living,2,mkxsr7,1,"With the recent lockdowns I just feel like my mental health is just getting worse and worse to the point where everyday feels exactly the same and I’m starting to feel numb. I barely leave my room due to having parents with only one goal in life which it to make my life a living hell. I haven’t showered in almost 3 days because I just don’t have the energy to get out of bed. My attendance in uni is just getting worse and worse. My grades are also getting worse to the point where my parents are threatening to stop paying for my tuition. My friends forgot I exist and never talk to me unless I start the conversation, and even when I do start the conversation it feels like I’m carrying it all by myself and they rather be doing anything other than talk to me. 

I just don’t feel like I have anything to look forward to and zero motivation to keep going. Whenever people talk about their future plans and goals in life it makes me feel even worse because even now I still don’t know what I want to do with my life. I guess all I need is a goal or a target to try to achieve but whenever I try thinking about my future nothing pops up. I used to think I would probably kill myself before I turn 20 but now I know that won’t happen because I can’t bring myself to doing it. 

I honestly don’t know what the point of this post is I guess I just needed to vent and let it all out."

I feel like everyone around me is bored of me or takes no like to me. None of my past friends talk to me and I’m usually left on delivered or they are “busy” all the time too much for me. I disappoint my girlfriend constantly and try to change but this heavy pound of depression won’t let me be fun or happy. I have terrible IBS and literally feel like I’m going to sh!t myself all the time. I have no motivation to do anything. All I do is go to the gym and try to work my heart out to be happy with myself and my body but I don’t even want to do it anymore. I cry myself to sleep majority of the time or just don’t sleep at all. I was so excited for this spring but I ended up hurting people and consisting it of causing arguments or being ignored by people I thought were my friends. I guess this is just me venting I don’t know. Maybe someone relating to this might help or some advice I just don’t know what to do. I know I’m 16 and I have time to change but I just can’t find the motivation inside to be happy."

A bunch of random thoughts of today. I hope it's not relatable.,2,mkxcjw,0,"Nobody likes me.

No, actually a lot of people likes me. But not like I want to. I need more.

But I can't ask that, it's rude.

Bath + microwave. A bottle of whisky. And I send my suicides notes to people to explain.

Why am I like this ?

Fuck, I only have 2 days left to prepare my next year.

One month of quarantine. It's going to be hell.

I can't even see the few people who seems to have a little interest in me.

My work is canceled. Fuck. I have nothing to do until summer.

Shot me.

Sorry mom, I know I done nothing today.

Why I have no will to live ?

If I'm attractive. Nice. Why do I have to put so much efforts into my relationships ?

I'm feeling so fucking lonely.

Fucking headache. I really need to sleep damn it.

I hate you mom.

I love you mom.

Why I can't die ? Why is it bad ?

I need meds. A ton of meds.

Ho gosh I fucking hate being alive.

Why am I feeling so empty ?

I need to stop to talk to people, I need to act like a real asshole. People will let me down. And I will finally be free.

Nope I can't.

Why I still have romantic feelings for people who only want to be my friends ? Why am so pathetic ?

I want to cut. But I hate washing the blood.

Shut up. All of you. You know nothing about my day. You have no idea of how it is in my head.

Fuck parents.

Fuck life.

Let me go. Stop crying when I talk about it. Stop caring about me.

And stop telling me to stay alive for you. Stop telling me you need me when you talk to me only once in 3 weeks.

fuck therapist. Useless.

Life should be a choice."
I just don’t know anymore.,1,mkxcbt,0,"I just currently hate everything, I moved away from a bad situation at my home a year ago (hoarding) I live in my own house now and I got a well paying job last summer. Well I want to move back home because I miss seeing my friends all the time and they constantly do stuff together, I hate living in suburbia and working in the city (my old home was in the country) I constantly feel homesick. I hate this job I have, the money is very good but I’m stuck there 10 to 12 hours a day, one week is days then the next week is nights I go home and basically shower then sleep then wake up for work again. Even when I’m having a good day I just have that feeling in the back of my mind that something bad is gonna happen or how I’m just not happy or how the good day is gonna end soon. I’m planning to go to school in the fall if I get accepted and that can’t come soon enough, but I know then I will constantly stress about not making money, I feel like my mind just constantly jumps from one thing to another of what to be stressed/ get anxiety about. I’m sitting here right now dreading going to work in the next hour and just spending every minute at work counting down until my shift is over. Thanks for listening to me rant, I just feel Iike nothing ever changes and there’s no way out."

Fuck I'm weak"
I can’t go back to work,1,mkx8oh,7,"Recently in the last month my depression has taken a turn and put me in a worse space than I was already stuck in. 3 weeks ago I continuously dropped a weight on my foot in attempts to break it, so I didn’t have to go in to work again. I’ve only worked once out of the past 3 weeks. The anxiety always kicks in the day I have work, then before I know it I get a strong urge to hurt myself badly. My minds just so split against going in and having to do an 8 hour shift in which I’m constantly upset, mentally drained and have panic attacks in the toilets. What do I do? I can’t see my psychologist for another month(it’s already been 3 months), I just feel like I’m constantly deteriorating inside and can’t go on much longer."
Opening up irl,7,mkx731,1,"I’m thankful to have this subreddit to use as an outlet when I’m at my worst, however, I believe I should open up to friends and family as a step towards improvement. I think some of my close friends would be receptive to hearing my story and potentially provide help for me. I would like to open up to them first, as my family contributes to a lot of my emotional trauma and the situation might get ugly. The problem is that I’m emotionally dumb and I wouldn’t know how to begin such a conversation. My aim isn’t to make things too emotional or awkward, but they should be informed about how dark things have gotten in my past so I know I have people to turn to when I’m feeling down again. It’s difficult because I’ve never had an emotionally supportive friend, and while I’ve tried online therapy, I’d imagine it would be a more candid experience. If anyone has ever experienced anxiety about communicating your depression with others, I’d appreciate your advice."

I don’t really know what I want to do in life and I’m just tired. I’m burnt out from my job and I quit it without another one lined up. I still live with my parents and they think I’m a bum. I don’t have my license either and I feel like I can’t make any decisions for myself because I’m super impulsive and can’t make up my mind and then when I feel like I’ve made the right decision, everyone makes me feel bad and stupid and then I second guess myself. I quit my job without a plan because I basically ended up letting it contribute a lot to my depression and anxiety so I started taking medication just to make it through a work day. I just want a break but I feel like a huge loser baby if I do that.

Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn’t mean I’m depressed because of the pandemic.,1885,mkx1uq,83,"I’m tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I’m just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn’t me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn’t the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties."
I need suggestions. Should I opt for antidepressants?,1,mkx1ml,1," 

I would really like to discuss it here before I reach out to a psychiatrist.

A year ago, I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed me a heavy dosage of medications. It included 5 different types of medications. The reaction I had to those meds was really horrifying. I couldn't sleep, I was literally numb and I just felt like a part of me had been just shut down. I was having serious sexual issues too. I contacted my psychiatrist but he didn't seem to care about any of this. He said it was normal, which it might have been but these things were too much for me to handle. I discussed here and people were shocked at why he would prescribe me so many meds all at once. The psychiatrist turned out to have a bad reputation for such things. I ended up going cold turkey and within some time things were back to normal.

Now, my problem is: I have anxiety and it gives me these sudden boosts of emotions, all kinds of emotions. I suddenly get really angry and stress seems to be just inches away most of the time. You can say that my resistance towards stress is very low. Like it doesn't take much for me to get stressed. That does not mean that I am always vulnerable, but you can say that stress catches on to me faster in comparison to others. I also quickly become mindful of my overwhelming emotions and can get things cooled down within 10-20 minutes.

I just get this sudden large supply of emotions as if a truck of this specific feeling has been unloaded. It doesn't just happen with sadness, it happens with happiness too. I don't know if it's bipolar disorder, but I was once diagnosed with GAD so I know for a fact that I have anxiety. It feels like initially, the dial for every emotion gets turned to 100, and then it slowly comes down.

Some time ago, I was also experiencing irregular heartbeats, shaky hands, fatigue, uncontrollable thoughts, concentration problems, etc. But I was also going through some relationship problems at that time, but when they ended, a lot of these symptoms came back to normal. My heartbeat got better, shakiness got better, but I still experience some of these and other symptoms from time to time.

I am not suicidal, rather, everything is going ok in life at the moment. But this sudden overwhelm and panic leads me towards embarrassment sometimes. For example, I might exaggerate something my friend did and after some time, realize that it wasn't that big of a deal and I overreacted unnecessarily. I can't just ignore something because my mind goes into this endless spiral, and in the end, It gets so out of control that I just have to let it out whether it's in a healthy way or damaging.

I have had very hard times in the last couple of years but things have finally started being well for me. I am grateful for how everything turned out in life, but this sudden overwhelm of emotions makes it hard for me sometimes.

My social life is also good and I have no thoughts of self-harm whatsoever. I used to be suicidal but not anymore. I mostly stay at home nowadays and don't do exercise that much so this could be a major reason.

I'm still really skeptical about antidepressants. But I'm also aware that my previous psychiatrist was at fault. And if my dose would have been lower or better suited, things might have turned out better.

But that's just a guess. The reason why I posted this in detail is that I want someone else to share their own experience. Someone who was in a similar situation as I am and whether the AD was really worth it, or if lifestyle changes turned out to help them get better without the aid of antidepressants?"

Family means absolutely nothing if the people around you constantly gaslight you, treat you like an object, and expect you to smile in their face and say “good morning, good night” BECAUSE since they’re family they deserve that basic respect. I guess I don’t deserve that respect in return, right?

So I guess it only matters that *you’re* treated right, fuck me because I’m younger. Fuck me for wanting to focus on my studies and talk to the little Friends that I have left. Fuck me for wanting to spend time to tend to the hobbies that are no longer enjoyable because of my depression. Screw me for trying to hold onto something to make myself even a little bit happier.

fuck me for focusing on all of those things and not you at every moment you need me at any time of the day. Fuck me for not replying to your demands to take you anywhere and Fuck me for having the audacity to get mad when you don’t even bother to ask if I have anything to do.

I’m not going to kill myself but some days I wish I could just to get it through this mans thick skull how much of an effect he has on me.

I’m tired of talking about this shit with my parents only to have them brush me off and claim that things will get better. Sure, I guess it’ll get better once I finally drop dead."
I hate my brother,2,mkwv05,3,"So i have been in a pretty bad place mentally for a while dealing with isolation depression and just general work/social related anxiety but i have been working on it trying to be positive and it was fine but my brother has been making life hell for the past few months he just treats me and everyone else in our family like shit he only interacts with me to give him stuff or do something for him witch i can never say no to or screams at me calls me names makes fun of the lowest stuff like how i used to cut as a dumb teenager he also threatens to tell everyone else in our family i have a herion addiction which i dont worst i do is smoke weed for anxiety he threatens to steal and break my stuff and sometimes does recently i have been taking him driving so he can finally get his license hes 22 and just treats my car like shit and drives like a maniac i had to call the cops on him today as he just started running lights and as soon as i said enough we need to pull over he floors it to around sixty eventually he came to stop i put into park and ripped my keys out of the ignition and called the cops while he proceded to trash my car and scream at me he also screamed at the cops and got a ticket for disorderly conduct now he demands i take him to court and pay the ticket i didnt even press charges and still gave him a ride home i try to explain to him how hard im trying to help him and he just tells me not to talk back to him as if im below him idk what to do anymore we both live with my aunt im appyling for apartments near me but idk if that would even solve it i dont want to hate him but i just cant handle this treatment from someone im trying to help 

ps sorry this is ranty and has poor grammar i just typed this as quick as possible"
I cant sleep or concentrate...,1,mkwugy,0,"I was fine, on lexapro for the last 2years .But starting february and worse in March,  I had a bunch o college stuff and went through a spiral of depression...I cant sleep more then 4hs at night, im super sleepy at 22 but wake up at 2/3 and cant sleep anymore. Then spend the whole day sleepy . I try to study but not only am I stressed and actually anxious while I study Im sleepy tired and sad and cant concentrate.....I dont know what to do....is there natural stuff to help concentrate and sleep?  
I told my psychiatrist and she gave me valerian root pills (for sleep) that I took for like 1week and did nothing, a weird thing that Im supposed to drink before breakfast for 2 weeks also didnt help (for concentration), and now Xanax.   
Is there any over the counter natural stuff maybe I can try, for sleep or concentrate. I jsut need to focused for 3h at least....i dont know what to do really...."
How do I be more supportive of my boyfriend?,7,mkwpnl,2,"So I don’t know if this is the right rubreddit to post on but my boyfriend has been diagnosed with depression before and he can be really moody and get really irritable over things and I know I’m not a therapist and there isn’t very much I can do and I can’t really physically see him very often, but if there are any other girlfriends that might know how to help or what to do when they’re feeling bad and need a little “pick me up” maybe but any kind of little things that could maybe help."
I wish i could give this body to someone else,1,mkwpmr,1,"I was always told how handsome i look, im tall, my teeth are fine and i dont have any serious physical condition.

I wish i could trade this body with someone else who would actually use it for something, instead of destroying it like i do.

I wish i could give it away to someone who is struggling with self esteem issues because of how they look...

I want to switch bodies with a crippled person, i dont leave my house anyway exept for work and groceries.

I want to give away my internal organs to someone who really needs them... My heart my liver my kidneys my eyes ect.

Have anyone else felt the same way? I feel like i dont deserve my body."
"It's like a roller coaster, it gets better for a bit and then it's downhill from there. When will this hell loop end?",1,mkwnf4,0,"For the 3-4 years I have been getting treated, I have noticed a pattern that keeps on repeating over and over again.

I get better, my meds work perfectly fine and I start to make progress, but then boom. Usually nothing significant happens, but all of a sudden my mental health gets worse, my meds don't give me the support I need anymore and I just start to fall back into not being able to do much.

Right now it's the downhill part, this time a huge fight with my mom triggered this, I'm constantly anxious, I have panic attacks and flashbacks of all the trauma in my life she has caused, falling asleep can take hours, and I have nightmares and wake up in the morning all sweaty. I don't have the energy or motivation for school like I used to have (could be also the quarantine) and my free time after school is being spent trying to distract myself so the memories don't come back

It's been stressful for the entire family, my dad is tired and started getting help himself for mental health again, but more seriously, my little sister has fallen deep into depression, self harm and being suicidal, the whole quarantine thing is messing everything up and me dealing with not only my mental health overall, I'm trying to get an autism diagnosis which is hard, and my dads house reminds me of the emotional abuse that happened here in my childhood

I'm trapped, I can't escape and my life feels like a big hell loop that goes on forever.

I don't know what to do as everything I have worked for and everyone I love are crumbling right in front of me. I can't watch my family fall apart like this, but I have nowhere else to go. I can't move out, I'm a student who has no income and is unable to work. I'm trapped in this house that is a constant reminder of what happened to me and my siblings when we were young 

I feel so small 

I'm so scared if I fall apart I'll take everyone with me, but I don't know if I can do this for much longer"
Do i really need therapy?,1,mkwh1o,2,"If life quality cannot be improved anyway, why exactly would you even need therapy? I mean what is the purpose then? 

Wouldnt it be better to quit therapy?"
I don’t think I’ll make it to graduation,4,mkw67h,0,"hey all, i hope your first week of april is good. 

i guess i’m at my wits end and looking for advice anywhere i can get it. i’m 21/M, and i’ve suffered with chronic treatment-resistant depression for as long as i can remember (officially diagnosed at 15). over the course of my mental illness journey, i’ve tried over a dozen medications, looked into alternative treatments (ECT, ketamine, etc.), and have been in different types of therapy for six years. while painful, it’s usually manageable, but i’ve had severe episodes periodically and a really rough suicide attempt that landed me in the ICU for a few days, plus the subsequent psych ward hospitalization for two weeks at 17. 

i’m a month away from graduating university with my bachelors. i’m graduating with a 4.0 GPA, a double major, and a year early, all on-top of always working a part time job or internship and on-campus leadership positions throughout my college experience and having mental illness. however, the past month has been some of the most painful weeks of my life, and my suicidal ideation has only grown. i’m deeply scared i won’t even make it to graduation, even after i’ve worked so hard. none of these achievements mean anything to me at this point in time. this most recent episode was brought on a month ago by my first real boyfriend breaking up with me out of no where, and i’ve taken it extremely rough. not only is a break-up a hard thing to deal with, but it’s really plunged me into a severe depressive episode and activated unhealthy behaviors. i cry several times a day, don’t have the motivation to do any of my work or assignments, and am highly suicidal. it’s similar to past episodes i’ve had (the most recent being last october), and i usually make it through (albeit with emotional scars and pain) with time and lots of therapy and help, but this one feels different and a lot worse.

any tips from fellow mentally ill friends on how to deal with an episode and the break-up? you think with years of experience and dealing with depression i would know what helps lol. any tips on what to do when you’re highly suicidal and how to resolve that? i just can’t be hospitalized (even though that’s probably the best option) at this point in time since i would have to push graduation and everything. and i know that shouldn’t matter because my mental health and staying alive should be first priority, but i can’t just turn my back on all my effort i’ve made. but it’s getting too painful on the daily basis to go on. anyways, thanks for listening and would love some wisdom from people who deal with depression or similar situation."
"My job is easy enough, why am I struggling so much with it??",3,mkw2ya,1,"I feel pathetic. At work my main task is doing clerical work, mostly doing a lot of calling people and making appointments. I feel stupid even complaining about it, but I end up crying every day over it. I sit at my desk and I can’t get my brain to work, I seriously can’t get anything done. I don’t know what it is.. I really don’t like the job, but I just need to suck it up, right? I am so anxious and sad all the time. I can’t even get motivated to do things that are enjoyable, so I can hardly do this job . I feel so dumb and useless. I’m not where I want to be in life. I don’t want to be a baby about it, I just feel like a failure. I feel miserable."
Writing down my thoughts post panic attack,2,mkw12a,0,"I feel like a failure. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't fix this. It feels like things are just going to keep getting harder for me. I really tried. I really wanted to get better and get to a place where I'm no longer suicidal or depressed or have anxiety. 

Especially the anxiety. 
It makes everything so hard. I can't function around people, I can't stand up for myself, I can't leave my home without feeling anxious, and I can't hold a job because I keep having panic attacks and feeling suicidal. 

I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of trying and feeling like I've failed and let everyone down. I just want it to end. I don't want to suffer anymore. I hate it because at the same time, I can't stop thinking and feeling so bad for all the people who do actually care and love me. I know they want to help and I don't blame them for not knowing how. I wish I didn't have to be around other people, only them. If I didn't have them, I'd have killed myself already. I don't know why I'm like this. I wish their love and support was enough to fix me. I don't really want to live this life anymore, but don't want to hurt them.

I'm only going to stay alive for them and block out the rest of the world."
I'm not sure if i'm depressed.,2,mkvzqg,0,"I have no peace.

I used to live a a care free life and i don't doubt it will return to that when i am eased. 

That care free life consisted of not caring about school/grades as that as a kid used to give me anxiety so just quit caring.

I started to ask myself the question what if you die tommorow? Where you happy before or were you just wasiting your time studieng while you could have had fun.

I started chosing fun over grades and stuff.

This way of life really gave me enjoyment and i was happy not anxious. I was living in the moment.

A little backstory i have a niece who is my world i love her endlessly. I can't live without her.
I have severe fear of losing her and want spend as much time with her as i can and i do. There is no particular health reason or anything that i have a higher risk of losing her but i seem to just put myself through it.

I don't think i'm depressed all the time but right now as of writing this i have cried on the toilet and am extremly dipped.

My niece was over for the weekend and i have a physics term tommorow, my niece left today and i decided to play with her instead of severly studieng as i thought id waste my time anyway.

I have a backup plan and can redo the test next year while not being behind but it still ails me that ill fail for some reason.

I also had two months to prepare but i just didnt do shit, i lacked the motivation and procastinated.

Ngl i enjoy what i do during the procastination. (Playing games with my beloved friends).

But rn i am in a severe dip and feeel very sad, tho writing this down helped me somewhat."
"Nobody cares about me, if icommit they wouldnt care",1,mksj4v,1,
I dont know what to do,3,mkvzgo,0,"My bf broke up with me after a year of being in the relationship. The first reason was that I was too much to handle, then it became to us not having a future, then it became to him not wanting to depend on a relationship for his happiness. I have been shaking for 3 days now and haven’t eaten today, I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel the constant need to blame myself and I want to hurt myself but I promised him i wont.

Do the majority of people that are compliant with antidepressants actually see success? Just doesn't seem accurate.,3,mkvz09,1," I ended up befriending other kids that were also abused in school, so I may just be seeing the worst of it. But out of all of us, only a few got their shit together correctly now in our 30s. And I bet even they still have a lot they're hiding from people, they're just doing it rather well.            
         
 The rest of us? Fucked. Even the ones that showed self control in life assuming things would work out, including me, ended up with problems. Mine and about 20% of others are more physical than mental. Majority are mental but no meds are working for any of us. So many of us are addicts, homeless, in prison, or dead.     
         
We rarely see anyone turn their lives around on medications, and if they do it's very short lived.            
             
I look at statistics and supposedly 60%ish of people respond well to antidepressants but that is not what I'm seeing.      

Then again my own doctors are almost always in denial about the side effects I report to them. I have to find out from others that they have similar problems with doctors. Just me saying that the meds are helping me sleep but making my original problems worse is still success to them?         

Things just don't seem to be adding up."
"Long-distance girlfriend on Pristiq since mid-january for illness related situational depression. Has slowly become more and more apathetic, less compassionate, emotional expression and communication dwindled. Increased dosage mid-feb and all that become sharply worse in the last few weeks.",2,mkvwgf,0,"
Since mid-january, my partner has become more detached and emotionally distant. It wasn’t that bad at first. I was prepared for the decrease in sexual attention/drive. But it seems to have decreased all forms of empathy and positive emotions in regards to our relationship. In feb, she increased dosage because she felt numb and like a zombie on the lower dosage. And according to her, it relieved her depression which I believe. She is definitely less melancholic. However, she has become apathetic and unable to feel or express her emotions (in her own words).

She went from professing her intense love to me 6-8 weeks ago, telling she never thought she’d feel this way about anyone again, to telling me a few days ago, she doesn’t know if she’s really interested in maintaining this relationship. She has become extremely annoyed and disdainful to me. To the point of being actively cruel. The difference in her behaviour between now and even just a week and half ago, is giving me whiplash. If I ask her to communicate what she’s feeling, she gets extremely upset and says she doesn’t know what she’s feeling and I need to leave her alone.

A week into march, we had our first big argument and she dumped me. But came back the next day begging me to take her back and she doesn’t know why she did what she did. Reprofessed her love and infatuation. Said “I was trying to listen to my favourite music today and I literally couldn’t hear it. I can’t hear music without you.” So I accepted her apology as long as she promised to work on improving our bond. Since then she’s done the opposite. Its hit the point where I brought up that exact quote 2 days ago and she basically rolled her eyes :( its like im talking to a completely different person.

We’re long distance so this relationship relies on communication and active effort. Before Jan, I can honestly say we’d never had any sort of friction or communication difficulties. We used to literally remark on how good we were at conflict resolution with each other. She’s already on the extreme end of anxious avoidant insecure style attachment. But that was easily surmountable prior to her starting these meds.

Am I correct? Is it the meds? I might just be grasping at straws to avoid facing the reality that she’s lost feelings for me. Her acute illness flare-up ended mid feb and her life’s starting to pick back up to what it used to be. She relied on me heavily for emotional support through Nov-Jan as she was in complete isolation. I made myself extremely available to her. It seems to be a combo of her no longer needing the emotional/social lifeline and her growing numb from pristiq. But even prior to her flare-up she was extremely compassionate and attentive. Since the reason for her situational depression is gone, can she come off it?


Sorry for the essay.
Tldr; Girlfriend has 180’d personality wise on me in just a few weeks. And all changes seem to line up with changes in AD medication regime. Does anyone have similar experiences with advice?"
The only thing I want in life is unattainable,2,mkvst6,1,"Being able to find a girlfriend who would eventually be my wife, starting a family and living with them is the only scenario in which I see happiness as a possibility. But it's impossible for me. There's nothing I can do to look decent. I'm short and ugly, I'm 21 and I'm going to be bald by 23 and my bodybuilding genetics are absolutely pathetic so I can never have a nice body. All I can think about is wanting to kill myself. I don't see a way out. I just have to die and that's it. Over 3 years of this shit killing me on a daily basis and it's just gotten worse. Not even a friend I can talk to about it so I resort to posting here. What the fuck can I do in this situation besides die"
Depressed teenagers are not taken seriously,5,mkvqy1,1,"It's not a hot new take, I know, but I wanted to get it off my chest.  
Teenage depression is too often dismissed as a typical teenage behavior.   
They are typically seen as moody, irritable, they lock themselves in their rooms, love to sleep in, don't care too much about school. It's considered normal, so depression is often overlooked.   
It makes it tough to recognize a teen who genuinely needs help.  
Sometimes makes me second guess if I made my depression up.  
I see teens online who think mental illness is 'fun and quirky', and they annoy me, but I'm even more angry at adults who seem to ridicule every teenager who claims to be sad and not doing okay, because it's just a 'teenage angst' and 'wait till the real world hits you and you have to work a minimal wage job, then you'll have it tough'..."
"it's okay for me to cut myself as long as no one knows this, right?",1,mkvnb9,1," 

Self-harm makes me happy. Pain helps me to cope with my own feelings. I've never had any major trauma in my life. I've never been bullied, I don't have abusive parents, etc. It's true that I suffered sexual abuse from a close relative, but it wasn't as bad as what other people suffered, right? Like, it could have been worse, right?

My best friend's mother doesn't like me and forced my friend to change schools so she wouldn't be near me. I still don't know what I did wrong. Why doesn't she like me? I did something wrong? I said something wrong? She was my only friend and now I have no one. We can't even chat online because her mom blocked me on all social media. Hah, so many people going through difficult times and I'm crying because my best friend's mother doesn't like me. Pathetic.

I feel such a pleasure when I cut myself but I don't even know why, exactly. I can't describe what I'm feeling, I can't even explain why I started cutting myself. Nobody should be involved in this, right? It's my body and the only person being hurt is me. Why do they care so much? If I feel good when I hurt myself on purpose, isn't that a good thing? It's okay for me to keep cutting myself as long as no one knows, right? If no one knows it means that I am not an attention whore, right?"
Realizations about dealing with relationships/friendships while depressed that others may be able to relate to,2,mkvm1y,1,"•I’ve realized lately that being depressed and dating someone or trying to maintain relationships is a million times harder for us than for others who may not have a chronic illness. It takes double the effort to take care of myself and contribute to a healthy partnership or friendships. This becomes increasingly difficult when you experience the symptoms of wanting to isolate yourself 

•A lot of times I’m just going through the motions. I’ll go have dinner with a friend or go on a walk with my boyfriend and just dissociate because I feel so terrible inside, but I feel that they’d think I was crazy if they knew. I feel like I’m just playing the part so much of the time and don’t even know how to be present. 

•I feel I need to hide the darkest parts of myself from them because I think they would be afraid to know who I really am or my true thoughts. How I have breakdowns and drink excessively or engage in other harmful behaviors. This becomes exhausting especially if you’re someone who tries to be happy externally a lot of the time, but eventually you break. When they do catch a glimpse of how much of a mess I am, it further causes me shame and deepens the depression because I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want anyone to take care of me. This is my mess and I know it’s sad. My heart breaks for myself when I think about how much I’ve struggled 

•I know I have attachment issues (anxious attachment style) but I find it hard to allow myself to truly connect with others because I know I’m fragile. If I were to lose them, and they were a large part of my life, it would make things worse. It’s easier to keep them at arms length in my mind, so it’s almost like I’ve become an avoidant attachment instead. 

•I second guess myself all the time. I’m extra sensitive so small things set me off and I blame myself even when the other person is actually to blame. It makes it hard to not have insecurities

This shit is hard. I’ve been in therapy for almost ten years because of continuous trauma and am on medication, and I still struggle every damn day. To whoever is reading this, you are brave to keep going. It takes so much strength to wake up every morning and put your feet on the floor with the amount of pain we experience. I hope that someday it gets easier for all of us and that we start to have small experiences of happiness here and there. I don’t know that any of us will be fully happy, but better is all we can hope for."
Can’t tell if I’m depressed,2,mkvkjc,1,"I’d (19/M) always been a generally happy person until last year. Because of that I don’t think I know what depression is, I think I have it now but I’m not sure. 

I’m in my 2nd year of college, I’m in the dorms currently. Since we just do like 90% online classes, I just stay in my room all day. I just can’t seem to do anything, and it’s been like that for the past year. My room is so messy that there’s no more walkspace left; I just have to jump from the doorway to my bed. I haven’t done the laundry in a month now. For most of my day, I just lay in bed and stay on my phone, or I just look at the ceiling and think about my past happy memories or look at pictures of it. I eat once a day at 2am, some Mac n cheese and a coke. I used to have many friends, but I just want nothing to do with any humans anymore. I used to get texts from them but I just couldn’t get myself to respond. Eventually, the phone stopped ringing, and I was ok with it. I probably have racked up like 15 missing assignments in the past 2 months. I’m terribly homesick, but I don’t really want to go home because I don’t want to see my family. I’ve somehow gained like 15 pounds this year though, even though I only eat once a day. I haven’t cut my hair in 9 months (I used to cut it every month prior to that). I don’t know, I’m just like it right now and I don’t see an end to it. Like, can’t even tell if I’m sad because idk, I think I’m ok with it. Idk. Idk. 

I just wanted to write this somewhere, no need to respond to it I guess."
Dont think I can keep up this fight,1,mkviqf,1,"I have always suffered from depression and anxiety since i was a kid.
I never really understood why i always felt down and worthless struggle to make friends and even when I do there is something in me which feels it must self destruct and end any relationship I form.
I have suffered in silence for around 20 years letting this darkness eat me up inside and now I just feel hollow.

All this pain has boiled over for so long it has led me down a dark park and I well and truly have screwed up now, no idea what is around the corner in life.
For the last week i have finally admitted my problems to a few people but I fear it is too late.

I love my job but I may have lost that now the only thing that made me want to wake in the morning, I can no longer go home untill further notice so what is left for me.

All I want is a way to end all of this quickly and to stop being a burden on other people.
I cant get this dark cloud out of my head and can not clear the shame I feel and what I have done to my family.
I am sorry for the rambling I just had to find a way to get this off my chest I do not know how long I can keep up this fight anymore."
Going to family gatherings is painful,3,mkvfvy,1,"Lately I've been really really depressed and am just gonna spill my guts here. The last week or so has been particularly bad. I oversleep, sometimes when I wake up I immediately start crying, basically all I do these days is cry and then get back to life. I also just really don't want to see people. I've been making excuses saying that I just have heaps of assignments (which is partially true) but it's honestly because I can't face seeing people.

I haven't left my house properly in months. And like I said, I'm just a mess and almost always want to cry. I went to a family gathering for the first time in a long time last night and I'm not joking when I say there were a few moments where I almost cried. I just didn't have the energy to fake a smile or act outgoing and interesting. I have nothing to say. It was painful talking to my niece. I tried my best to smile and say a few things but it was just really uncomfortable and I just felt bad. 

It was embarrassing explaining to my niece that I have no friends, or why I wasn't talking, or why I was ""studying"" all the time. I have this feeling that my sister has been talking about it. I mean what kind of 9 year old asks about things like 'what career I want to have' or 'if I failed at uni last year'. I mean, how does my niece even know that. 

I felt weird when my sister talked in this weird ""sympathetic"" voice. Its hard to explain but when she knows I'm down she talks to me like I'm a kid who just fell down and grazed their knee. And I know they have no bad intentions. I'm not mad about it, I just feel like an alien. 

It feels like I want to be happy not for myself but because people expect me to be. Like I need to smile more, be more energetic, be talkative. I'm good at pretending to be happy. Ive always done that. But now it just feels like I can't be bothered doing that anymore. And I'm tired of pretending to have things together and being expected to when I just don't."
I am not sure iF I am depressed.,1,mkvf5u,6,"I have seen my family and was happy about it, did some sports(first time in 2 months) and enjoyed it. But then again, I have no intrinsic motivation/drive anymore. Should study for important exams -> nope. does not trigger any emotion.
Got Back a grade from months ago(no depressive epsiode), class best -> 10 second happy/glad then nothing. everyone else was happier, no emotional reactions on my side.
I would prefer just to do nothing at all and perhaps have some sex. But that is about it. No ambitions. No vision.

Just because of that I'm a sitty person, of course, you see it from my perspective, but I feel like if once in a while I'm gonna be self-centered it nought help me, but no, I'm just a sitty person apparently, and the only thing that's keeping going forward is the fact that my will is made out of iron, but with iron will you can get so far, I'm not really sure how far I can go forward if even my whole family is turning their back on me.

I'm sure I will get over it, but will I choose the right way of getting trough it? I feel like I'm getting closer to being in a grave every decision I make.

Anxiety mixes well with depression,2,mkuyul,1,"Going back to school after 4 months  quarantine. I like no one there :).
Not a single soul.
In fact I don’t like anyone at all, no one is interesting enough to satisfy me in a conversation. I have no hobbies as well lmao.
I have a few good friends 160 miles away from where I live. But the only thing I do with them is taking drugs till we pass out and wake up someplace we’ve never been at before and hope no one took our belongings.

The only thing keeping me alive right now is my older brother. He isn’t supportive in any way but I just fucking love him. We’re best buddies.

I don’t live with my parents for your information.
I live at my school, the school is my home. That means I have to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with people I don’t like. I can’t be alone in my bedroom because I have a roomie. I can’t fucking shower without meeting people I hate to get to the fucking public showers.

I probably sound like a school shooter right now lol, if I ever had the chance to shoot up a school I would be the first and only victim.
My brother tells me that I need to find a girl, “find a girlfriend and all your bad thoughts will fade away” he would say. 
Like that’s ever going to happen :)

I don’t even know why I’m sad, I just don’t feel like living you know..
It feels like your coming down from a high dose of Md and nothing just fucking matters and you want to die every minute and every minute feels like 10 minutes and a whole day feels like a week of very potent sadness. Idk what else to write so yuh."
I'm need people to talk to desperately,1,mkuynr,4,"hello, I am very down and depressed atm. I really just need people to talk to. my mum is not supportive of anything I do in life and I am at wits end. I'm close to ending it all. please can someone help me"
I'm so fucking terrified,1,mkuy5t,3,"So, I should be going back to see my therapist after x days (my parents booked me an appointment and I'm too scared to ask when) it was at first for my let's say not so tolerateable worsening headaches that painkillers do no shit to and the doctor said I should see a physcologist so yeah that's it I know I've relapsed and I honestly feel so ashamed to face her again and I hate that I can't pretend anymore and I hate myself more for doing this to my family, they're all so very supportive and yes, I do hate lying to them but I can't do anything else like what am I supposed to do? ""Mom, I've tried to kill myself "". I choked myself for a few seconds I assume and I didn't turn blue or anything, more like I wanted to pass out for some time and be fucking freed from my mind. I'm not gonna rant more about how hard everything is and just forcing myself to live takes so much energy, energy I don't even have I know she's gonna ask me about suicidal thoughts and attempts but I'm terrified of telling the truth, of being locked in that same room with people staring through that small hole and from seeing my mom cry after the physcologist telling them about my diagnosis It has only been a year, I should've done better and not have let anyone know but now it's done and idk what to say then"
"Slipping down more and more, need advice",1,mkuw4m,0,"Hi,

I'm a 26 years old guy and for the past year things have been getting worse for me, and especially so the past 3 to 4 months. I clean up my place less often, cook less and order in more, have little to no motivation to study and am barely going out and being active anymore. I don't know how to get out of this hole, is there any advice you could give me?

Anything would go, diet tips, planning and so on."
I don't know if I want to do anything,1,mkuvxo,1,"I am writing this post at 2am Indian time thinking about what the future holds for me. All I see is a bleak future with me being left behind and everyone else getting what they always wanted. I am a student of physics in somewhat reputed institute in India. I have always loved physics and always wanted to have a career in research in Physics. I have performed reasonably well in my semesters. But for the last 3-4 weeks I have been feeling very low about myself. It feels like I will end up messing up everything and live a below average life barely surviving. I think that I have never been good at anything. I lose interest very fast in most of the things that I start. As I am writing this post, I hope I am able to complete it before giving up on this post too. The only thing that has kept my interest up is my love for Physics and Football. Football has been my other interest as well. I used be a very good football player and I was very enthusiastic about football so much so that for 5 years straight I was the first one to show up at the football practice everyday. I always pushed myself to my limits, wanting to do better. I always contemplated on becoming a footballer despite my country not having any launch pad for footballers at that point of time. All of this ended when I graduated from my school. I knew that Football was maybe something I really loved but having a career in it is not something I can ever achieve. From here, everything started going downhill. I still had by love for science and physics specifically but I always could never live upto my own expectations. I had an ugly and toxic habit of comparing myself to others. The others achieved great feats in whatever Football but I could never do anything extraordinary. I always saw myself as someone who always put in extra effort to be at the level of others who didn't have any extra trouble reaching there. Same was in my academic career. I had to study an extra night to be the level of my fellow classmates. Still I would make mistakes in an exam. These mistakes had a debilitating effect on my self confidence. I have been getting distracted very much lately. The online semester has made my attention span shorter than that of a goldfish. Whenever I realise that I am losing focus I would start hating myself for it and then  slogged day and night to study subjects that I don't really if I like it anymore. I am trying to convince myself that I love physics but truth be told, I don't know if I love it and I have had thoughts of dropping out in my mind. But  that would be of no avail because I don't have any back up plan too. I still think that there might be some spark left to be ignited and all hope is not lost. But I am trouble in finding the math to light that spark up. I have been trying to aply for internships. I wrote to 20 professor all over the country, and none of them replied. Is it me? Am I really that bad at everything? When I put my thoughts into the retrospect, I see that all I have been is a failure. I have never been able to have a stable relationship with anyone. All of my ""friends"" ignore me. All the people that I have been attracted to have not reciprocated. All the hobbies that I have tried having ended in a week. At this point of time, my future seems very bleak and I don't what to do about it.




P.s.- I am sorry for such a badly composed post. I have had troubles in writing this. Hope you understand."
I don't know how to get people to notice.,3,mkurme,3,"In 2014, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD. I am also a highly sensitive person and I live with a chronic illness that has no cure. I graduated from college in May of 2020; a wonderful time to enter the job market. This past year has been extremely difficult and I have been suicidal and have self harmed for the first time ever. My only daily contact is with my direct family (I moved back home after I graduated), my coworkers (I work at a small local restaurant), and my boyfriend. I am not actively telling people about my depression and how low I feel, one could even say that I am actively trying to hide it since if I were to really say how I felt, I would be complaining all the time. Yet at the same time, I wish people noticed. My friends from college do not reach out to me. In college, I didn't have a friend group. I had friends within different circles, but I was not contained to one. I wish now that I had found a group, but at the time, I was focused mostly on my health and prioritized that over collegiate opportunities and experiences. I recognize that it isn't healthy to have my boyfriend as my only friend, and I know that he is not trying to make that the case (I think our relationship is very healthy in fact). But the pressure I'm subconsciously putting on him to be my boyfriend and my only friend is causing me to think that our relationship isn't working either (which I know isn't true!). I am not active on social media like I used to be, I am not actively texting in group chats like I once was, and yet, I don't have anyone reaching out to me asking if I am doing ok. I will receive the occasional ""miss you"" text from a friend here and there. But it's all surface level. How do I get the people who used to be in my life to care and reach out to me? Am I being selfish for wanting them to reach out to me first? Do I have to promote my sadness to get my friends to notice me? I am so lonely."
I actually am different,3,mkuqhl,1,It’s hard to accept but I know it’s true. I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 12 but I didn’t want to believe it. I guess I was so good at masking I even fooled myself... I’m 20 and now I have no other choice but to believe it because I have an autistic burnout. My therapist and psychologist agree with me. It began a few months back and I eventually had to quit school because of it on October 30th 2019. I recently had to quit my parttime job at a pizzeria too (Even though I only worked 4 to 8 hours a week) because I began feeling even worse. I don’t know how to deal with feelings this bad anymore. Why is my brain like this...
Idk.,5,mkun8e,1,"Hi. My name is quentin and im 23, and I feel like i dont know anything anymore. I used to be able to do anything, say anything and think whetever i want. But recently it just feels like ive been slowly crumbling away. My MPD is constantly getting worse, i havent been able to get a job due to my lack of energy and self confidence. I cant even be around my family anymore. And since my grandma passed away, all of that feels like it just sped up. Days/months have been just flying by while I unintentionally waste away. I decided to share this because i have no other outlet for anything anymore, and i really need help.."
Pretending that everything is fine,38,mkuliu,15,I've been doing this because I don'f wamt my friends and family to see my true self and I feel horrible about it
Feeling nothing anymore,3,mkukvo,2,"I just don't know it anymore guys. Like i don't feel anything anymore, no happiness, no joy just an empty void of sad thoughts. I just don't know it anymore. Idk why I am sad you know. I don't think i am really depressed or anything but i just don't feel anything anymore. No love, no joy. I don't have people who i really care about. Exept family ofc. I don't have anyone I would do anythong for just to talk with them. Just to be with them. There is no one in my lofe like that. I just feel sad 24/7 and idk how to fix it.

Sorry for the bad English its not my native language."
A rant/ need some encouragement,4,mkuh1p,4,"On a throwaway 
I stopped seeing my psychiatrist (he is actually a PA under a paychiatrist) when covid started bc I had huge amounts of anxiety about teletherapy. I actually just ignored my appointment even though they called me and ignored the calls because I was so anxious. I also stopped taking my medication (lexapro) 
I know it sounds ridiculous but I’m scared to go back and ask for help. I’ve been really struggling but I’m scared he’s going to be mad at me because I stopped medication in the past and made me promise not to do it again bc it is dangerous. I’m at the point where I dont know if I can go back or if I should just fine a different psychiatrist. Another concern of mine is he  encouraged me and gave me a lot of advice about taking organic chemistry in college and going into medicine. I ended up getting Cs in orgo I and II and I feel like I just dont want to talk about school with him. I dont know what to do b bc I feel like it would be better to go back to someone I am familiar with but I am terrified and I’m on the verge of tears about this.




This is a side note/ extra rant but I am also in a new relationship and when I got into it I wasn’t really struggling and didn’t want to mention my depression and now I dont really know how to talk about it with him and I’m scared bc I really care about him and dont want to be a burden on him and I’m also scared he won’t understand. I’m also scared to lose him bc I just dont feel as connected to him and I feel very anxious but again I think this is a mental health issue. I also feel so dumb bc I am a junior and I feel like I’m not at all prepared to graduate college since my grades suffered and I didn’t get involved partially bc of mental health probably although I keep thinking it was laziness it’s hard to tell them apart"
hi,5,mkug10,1,i can’t seem to keep a profile picture for long i always end up deleting it. i just want someone to save me sometimes i know that’s selfish i know everybody has problems but can’t we help eachother?
I hate being relied on/ responsibilities.,5,mkubot,2,"I'm [22m] and I know it's gonna sound childish and dickish, but I felt like I've been asked for help way too for a while now and it's burning me out. I work second shift, so my mornings are always available which resulted in all the favors and chores I've been asked to help out with. I'd help watch my sister's kids, drive my Mom way early to work everyday and other  given stuff to do along the way. 

I felt like the last couple months was a  rollercoaster because a while back I would have simple mornings to chill and relax before work, but for a while now it's a constant on and off, mornings filled up and then go straight to work. It's been stressing me out so much now, especially since I have to go to bed as soon as I get home to drive Mom to work.  No free time at all. 
Even my free time off work is used due to being asked for favors. When I do have legit free time, I'm too tired to do anything and decide to sleep. 

I live with my Mom rent free and she has been so good to me , so I know I shouldn't be complaining, buts it's really been eating at my how much limited time I have to myself is going away. I just want time to be me, and all this stress is just causing my depression to go haywire at times. I try my best to hide it, buts it's just getting worse. 

I know in the end I'm just being a bitch, but I felt like I needed to rant to someone(being the internet lol), so forgive me for being selfish!"
I can’t feel anything,4,mkubl5,4,"All I had was games and anime but now even those things(as pitiful as it sounds) no longer elicit any emotional response from me...I feel like I should be sad, that I should just end my life now that I can’t even afford to escape my thoughts. But I feel nothing..it was all I had since I let everything else go to shit, I didn’t care as long as I could escape...I see now my nihilistic views are no longer after thoughts but in fact truth and I can’t bring myself to do anything else but live not to die...funny I have no reason to live but I still insist on living a meaningless life regardless...I keep going back hoping they’ll be something there..it’s like I’m a zombie, I live without reason driven by instinct and faded memories of a version of myself that no longer even exists..even interacting w family feels so alien...I don’t have the will to lie anymore..I can’t even tell if I’m sorry..I don’t know how I feel all I can think about is letting go. But most unfortunate of all I know I’ll probably live this way until I die..I’ll pretend everything’s fine bc I’m too pussy to actually end my own life..it just doesn’t make sense to me, nothing does anymore..I wish it did hurt maybe then I could stop but there’s no point now..I wish could laugh it off accept shit and move on but I can’t even tell if those are lies..Idk anymore I give up"

Sorry If this is rude/harsh and not good for on here,im just trying to post my feelings and help <3"
I hated going to sleep but I also love to stay asleep,161,mku7vc,15,"I just hate it that everytime I am about to fall asleep all these negative thoughts and emotions just keep on gushing out of my brain. To the point that I am almost hallucinating like my brain is making me relieve all the things that I hate about my past or what kind of future awaits me. And then when I actually fall asleep i hated the idea of waking up because the same thing will happen when I am about to sleep again.

Because of this my body clock is severely damaged. Like i always wait for my body to become so tired or fatigued that my brain wont have any energy to give me negative thoughts and emotions"
"I have the perfect life, why am I depressed",4,mku6s4,3,"I’ve (24F) dealt with anxiety/depression my whole life, but wasn’t diagnosed until age 20. So for the past 4 years I’ve tried different meds and therapy, as well as trying different coping techniques such as exercise, journaling, etc. 

I have a bachelors degree, a full-time job, a truly loving husband, a house that we own, and two sweet baby angel dogs. What more could a person ask for? Especially after the last year so many people were sick/dying, losing loved ones, losing jobs, and here I am, sitting in my perfect little life still so utterly and completely depressed. While everyone else was suffering during 2020, I got married, purchased my first home, got a raise at my job, and got a second dog.

I feel like such a piece of shit, I hate myself so much. I wake up every morning and wish that I hadn’t. My husband does everything he knows how to try and make me feel better, but nothing works. I feel like such an ungrateful bitch."
Infuriated! For decent mental health help in the US you have to be wealthy to afford it with insurance.,8,mktx9t,0,"My son has made some serious mistakes and suffers deeply with depression, RAD and others. He has made some decisions where his action lead him to either enter a residential 8 month program to get the medical and psychological help he desperately needs or go to jail. I have the best insurance I my employers provides and still would cost me $10,125 for the first 4 weeks then $6,000 each month afterwards. I don’t have it, I can’t get it. I pay taxes, I pay a thousand a month in insurance premiums and I’m still in this situation. WTF is wrong with our current system!? 
But if he had cancer or a heart attack, insurance would pony up the money and I could just pay my deductible over a year and everyone is healthy again. So frustrating. I don’t know what to do. I can’t fail my kid. This is a do or die situation I feel like."
This is so dumb,1,mktx15,0,"TW: selfharm, suicide-ideation 

I spent the most beautiful week with my boyfriend, and today he had to go back to the country he works in and I won't see him until friday and won't have much time to spend with him because I have to work on fuckin saturday and I know I'm overreacting but like I wanna kill myself and THIS S U C K S. So now we talked on the phone for like 5 fucking minutes and now I'm laying in bed crying and contemplating selfharming because that's like a reasonable thing to do am I right? Lmao
This is so dumb I know but why does it have to feel like the end of the world just because I can't see him for 4 days I hate everything

I was so happy that week, I ate normally I was pretty happy I kinda felt normal and now I'm back at my fucking filthy apartment and I just really want to die"
"I tried to talk to my dad about my depression, and he just suggested I talk to a friend, and didn't mention it again. Point taken...",2,mktwf1,0,"My dad usually calls me lazy, and frames me as stubborn and unwilling when I don't manage to do everything because of my depression. I am in the middle of an episode now, and everyday life is hard. Everything seems so pointless, and telling my dad that I am not feeling well was kind of a big step. I have previously thought there was no point trying to explain my behavior, he sees all my symptoms of depression and lables it laziness. When I mentioned it, he made it clear that he did not want to talk further, by just saying that I should talk to someone. I asked who, and he said ""a good friend"". He gets mad when I don't participate in the usual pleasantries and smile and be polite, while it takes all the energy I have just to get out of bed. 

I have even told him it hurts when he calls me lazy, and that I am not plotting against him trying to avoid helping out."
can you *really* overcome depression?,33,mktvgi,18,"I really don't have the energy to talk about what i'm feeling or used to feel but i think after getting help for a year and having some great months right after i'm on the edge to be depressed again about same issues i had before. So i wonder, do we really ever overcome depression"
Don't want to die but tired of trying,2,mktusc,0,"Well Life has been a cluster fuck. Why is that I was better at managing my life when I didn't have to focus on my mental health. I'm making  great strides and it's been trying but fulfilling journey. But everything is going to shit. My body has decided to break down and produce too many cells and I'm feeling every cell division. Sick and running a fever which put me out of work which means I'm not making money and money makes the world go round. 

It's exhausting trying to manage my mental health (MDD, PTSD, Bi-Polar and Anxiety)  It was almost easier to be a functioning wreck with addiction than it is to be aware of these issues"
Please tell me what the point of living last 25 is?,25,mktsdl,10,"If my only priorities in life are looking pretty and impressing people what’s the point.
I don’t want kids, i don’t want to be in a relationship (ever) so i don’t understand what’s left for me after 25. 
I don’t consider any talents or skills impressive if you’re not young while you have them so that’s one priority out the window and i don’t think anyone over the age of 25 or 26 is attractive so there’s the other one.
I love my friends but i watch my parents with theirs and even though they seem happy their life seems so colorless, the stuff they talk about is so kind numbingly boring i don’t understand why anyone bothers to live if they’re not young. I don’t understand why please just give me a reason, any reason!"
I'm so done.,3,mktqzp,1,"My girlfriend is basically not in love with me anymore,nobody wants to talk to me. I'm so fucking shit in school. I AM SICK OF THIS."
In a nutshell,1,mktqnd,0,"I have no drive. I want to be successful. I want to game and chat with people. I don't like what people are. I wish I had a best friend. My self loathing would come through. I have moments of clarity. I know what I want in life. I'm getting older and I have nothing to show for it. I sabotage every relationship and then bury myself. I don't like walking. I used to work out all the time. When I connect with someone there is always something in the way. I don't drink as much but my mental is getting worse. No matter what you say, to me there is a ""normal"". I want someone my age who gets me but I only want friendships. Asking someone to accept my baggage and still love me is hard. It's why I'll truly always be alone, no matter who is in my life. People always have hidden motives. Trust can't be truly given because why should i? I never show me though. you'll never get the real me. you can't handle it truly. it's a sad truth im living with. major depression. anxiety. anger. what's love? idk."
oblivious parents,1,mktq87,0,they will never know how much their actions hurt me.
Everyone hates me and are jumping to conclusions about me. What’s wrong with me?,1,mktmvq,3,"I posted what happened Saturday night and I got a lot of people talking shit about me and refused to leave me alone. They called me a pervert, a psychopath, and other horrible names. Then they accused me of spamming and reposting when I was only wanting sympathy. I told them exactly what happened, but yet they acted ignorant and started jumping to conclusions, like I need to be locked up, I was a whiny little bitch who is desperate for attention, a liar to make myself look better, a pervert who watches men change, etc.

Those were all false. I only want help. I’m tired of people talking shit about me like they think they know everything. In fact, I got trolled by several people, one is a flat-out bitch, another is a smartass. I had to block one of them already because she won’t leave me alone. I can’t seem to stop without thinking how much of a horrible person I am, how they’re right about me. Even worse, they tend to point out how I cry about people insulting me and yet they don’t seem to care about everyone feels but themselves.

I’m so sick of them all. I feel like I’m going crazy. Are they right about me? What’s wrong with me? Why do I feel this way?"
Messy,2,mktmnx,0,"21 (M) It's like my head is forever in a mess. I can't function like how a normal human being would. I struggle to work with people or talk to people. It's been a tough time for me to do the simplest bit of things and I literally don't have any will in me to do anything. It's been going on for months now and I have constant anxiety of how am I going to survive in the future when I can't even survive on my own. I'm in need of a miracle in my life. To save me from being dumb. To save me so that I'll be able to understand others better and just let this inner voice to stop speaking evil. I really hate this. I want to be good. But it just seems that I'm really far from being good. I'm tiring everyone out. I'm tiring myself out. I just need a way out of this. I don't know how will I able to find a job when I'm simply the worst person to work with. I'm just really damn slow at everything now. Even talking to people is just a hard thing for me to do. All of these constant worries really tires me down. I don't want to kill myself. I want to live. But I don't want to live this way. I just want to be a better person, a better friend, a better human being in general. But FUCK man. I take so much time to decide on something simple, and I've destroyed so many friendships of mine because I'm trapped in this stupid head. I've been staying home most of the time and I'm just rotting day by day. All I do is sleep, wake up, shower, eat and then sleep again. It's like this is my life now. I just feel so off right out in the public, or with my friends because most of the time I wouldn't be able to comprehend what some of my friends are talking about and I just feel like a totally lost guy and the person who's not needed in the circle anymore. LORD SAVE ME.

TLDR; Constant anxiety about the future because I'm dumb and slow, tiring everyone in my life because I'm too busy living in my head. Stuck in a rut, and struggling to find my way to save myself and prepare for my future."
Hi idk what to do,1,mktkd5,0,"I've been crying for the past 30 mins now. Its been like this for 3 night straight. Its been in my head since the past month that i don't have friends. Sure i call them my friends but i dont know if they call me one. I just realised this when i was really frustrated and just want advice from someone. But then i keep thinking that i would just disturb them and why would they give me advise on such things when they probably dont care about me. Yes I've been left out, yes it triggered my anxiety attacks, yes no one knows, yes i just keep it all to my self mostly. I don't know what to do. I keep telling my self its okay but clearly isn't. I'm exploding silently and slowly. I don't want to do anything. I don't have the energy anymore. I'm not the same as before. I dont know who i am anymore. I shouldn't be like this other people have it much harder than i am. Keeping up this facade. Lets just keep living till he tells me its enough. Family doesn't help either. They just.... I'm just a middlechild thats not important. Just have to squeeze in anything. Not always included."

My Depression is sometimes childish and I HATE IT,2,mktjjx,1,"Literally like just now I can go on instagram and see someone who I used to talk to like another friend of mine's post (who I didn't even know knew each other) and when i saw that I immediately thought that they've become friends to spite me, plotting something behind my back or something. 

I always try and remind myself that the world is small so it's not so impossible circumstances and why has everything got to revolve around me!

But that only works for like 5 seconds. I feel really suicidal now because it's so hard not think that little by little people are gonna hop aboard the ""conspire against me"" bus, and it's gonna follow me my whole life.

Why can't I just let stupid things go!!!"
My family (most of all dad) constantly ignores any boundaries I set and I don't know how to deal with it anymore,0,mktir3,1,"I (26F) had to move back in with family during the past year (55F and 56M parents, 18F and 21M siblings), and I thought I was mentally stable to take it on. I've had a difficult relationship with my parents in the past, we moved past it when I went to therapy about 7-8 years ago, it's been okay since. My mum tries to help me in her own way, which I appreciate, but my dad ignores it when that's most convenient. I don't even know how to describe it, but my dad is very self-involved, I would even call it narcissistic, to the extent that we always have to listen to him because he is ""very smart, much smarter than other people"" (literal quote) yet he will never, ever entertain an opinion different than his. He is always only looking for ways to boost his own ego and it is exhausting. I cannot hold a conversation with him because unless he can (1) show off, or (2) turn it into a monologue, he is not interested. 

As many here, I have troubles with staying interested in things - I used to have a lot of hobbies, I just don't anymore. I finally picked one up and have been doing it semi-consistently, yoga, and it is actually giving me some kind of peace. But I don't want to share it with my family because I know what'll happen - jokes, or my dad instantly saying he's better at it or making fun of me - which usually leads to me not wanting to do the thing anymore. Today I had a normal conversation with my mum about yoga, she does it, too, until she started asking which classes I follow. I have my favourite and I just don't want to share it, because last time I shared something about yoga my dad said 'do it now, so we can all laugh at you' followed by 'I'm better at it, do you know it's really good for you' and a lecture. I got defensive, because it feels like a test - I know this is partially my paranoia, but it felt like they were 'checking' I really knew what I was doing, because that has happened before - and while my mum said, 'but I'm not testing you', my dad just started shouting 'yeah what's the big deal with you thinking that, anyway?' and when I didn't answer he just said it again, but louder. He's the type of person to say - if something affects you, it's your fault because you 'let it affect you'. He's full of slogans like that. I just don't want to share my hobbies with him because he'll just bulldoze right over me, and I think I'm justified in that, but the last time I said something like that to his face he played the victim and ended up throwing a tantrum. 

I am so, so, so tired. I am a husk of my former self of a year ago, I am exhausted trying to finish my studies, and slipping back into a pit of depression. I just don't know what to do anymore."
How to Help My (15F) Friend (15M)?,3,mktfjk,1,"Hi dudes, I have this really great friend (I'll call him A) who is very sweet and talented but struggles a lot with depression. He's opened up a lot about it to me recently, and he's helped me with my own problems a lot in the past. We see each other at school, but our primary form of communication is through text since we don't get much time to talk to each other between classes. Anyways, I keep trying to empathize, but I feel like I say the wrong things, and I don't want to trivialize his problems. We have really good conversations, and I really wish I was able to help him in any way possible.

A has told me about how every day kind of feels like nothing and he can understand why people harm themselves just to feel something. We talked previously about suicide and death, and while he says he does experience suicidal thoughts, he's not actively suicidal and basically has a million reasons not to. He also told me that he is currently taking Zoloft, so I hope that helps.

Anyways, to be honest, I just really want to be a better friend, because he helps me a lot with my own issues and I feel like I don't reciprocate enough. What's the best course of action here?"
How to get back my will to do anything?,1,mktfa4,0,"I hardly feel like typing this either so to sum up: how do I get back my will to work or apply effort to things? I feel so exhausted all the time, I feel partially from stress that just keeps building up with no resolve. All I can manage is honestly scrolling through social media for hours because it requires thought or anything. I can hardly even force myself to go to the bathroom unless I'm dying. Help to get motivated and interested in life again?"
What’s love got to do with it,3,mktf6t,0,"I don’t expect anyone to respond with advice or words or anything at all but I think it would be nice to get it out. Also I’m 23F if that gives anything context. 

To make a long story short I honestly feel like I’m drowning in my emotions and no one around me can see I’m struggling and if they can they’re just watching. 

I have girlfriend and she has her issues and I’m always supportive, I’m always staying with her as she cries, or rants, she has adhd so finds it difficult to pay attention so sometimes it feels like I’m constantly fighting and forcing her to pay attention to me, but as soon as I say something or God forbid I have an attitude she gets all “woe is me, everybody hates me”. I love her with everything that I’ve got but I’m starting to believe when they say loves just a temporary emotion. Because if she loved me dont you think she’d see if I was sad? When I bring it up that I’m feeling down she wouldn’t complain that I’m making everything about me even though I hardly bring it up. I don’t think she loves me, she’s loves that I don’t make her feel lonely, she loves the fact that no matter what she says or does to me I’ll always be there for her 

I don’t really remember what it’s like being happy, everyday it feels like I’m being pulled deeper and deeper underwater. I used to be on meds and it was kinda okay but it’s so hard to get an appointment nowadays so I can’t even get the meds or appropriate therapy/counselling

I don’t know what to do or who to turn to, all that claim to love me make me feel even worse for even bringing up the fact I’m sad or make me feel as if it’s my fault even though I’m trying every I can. 

Honestly getting tired of fighting this drowning feeling I just want to give up"
Bad Day......,1,mktds0,0,"When I do something wrong, my dad always  yells at me right away he told me today that I am hopeless and now I am very sad. My brother committed suicide 2 months ago, i wish  it was me instead of him i think he love him more.."
How would they feel? is it worth making them feel like that to end this misery that is my life?,1,mktcyi,0,"I don't know how to explain this really, but a lot of the times I think about how much I want to commit suicide, but want to know how my friends and family would react. I want to know how they'll feel- will they even be sad? All I'd want is for them to give me some sort of self-validation with their negative emotions, but of course that wouldn't matter once I was dead. 

Maybe this is just my brain's way of a plea for attention- all I really want is to be able to sit down with my best friend before she moves away (across the country) and tell her everything, but I tried to do it before and she just called me a freak, before blocking me. I've considered asking some people how they would react/feel once I was dead, but I'm worried that they won't be genuine responses, or I'll get reported to a suicide tipline. Not sure how to end this off, but hope everyone has as good of a day as possible 💚"
My depression is not justified,19,mkt8xz,3,"I'm 18 years old, living alone with my mother since i was 1yo. 
I was supposed to be a ""save your marriage free"" baby, but it didn't work out too well. 

I felt like absolute shit for the past 5 years or so, but i never once told anything to my mom or to any of my family members.
In the past everytime i told something to my mom i ended up regretting it sooner rather than later, thats why i swore to never tell her anything ever again, and im a man of my word. Not like she cares too much anyway.
i was always scared that people whould think that i only do it for attention or to have an excuse for why i'm i such a faliure, thats why i always tried to hide my depression and social anxiety as best as i could 

Now im a complete shut in.
I barley leave my room or talk to anyone.
I spend all of my time sleeping, playing videogames, just laying on my bed staring at the wall or studying sometimes.
I dropped out of high school and went back to a different one, so im not going to have any sort of degree for a few more years.
I was trying to get a job of any sort for a year now, but everywhere i go there is at least a dozen
overqualified people lining up for even the shittiest job possible. 

These last few months where too much.
I couldn't pretend to be OK anymore.
And the first time in my life my mom acknowledged that something is wrong with me.
And after that she reacted the way i expected she whould. 

For the past couple of weeks she's been yelling at me almost every day:
shes so fucking done with me, im a lazy piece of shit all i do is sleep all day, my room is a complete mess.
I can play the ""depressed"" she could be so much more depressed than me but she dosen't have the time to, i just pity myself
and things like that.

And i totally get it. 

Working just so you can feed your son, and when you come home all you see is that he is a  fucking mess.
I feel really bad because of that.
And she maybe can't see it but im grateful for all the things she's done for me.
But she talks like i don't have the privilege to feel sad.
She acts like my feelings are invalid because her life is harder.
She makes my feel like a fucking asshole for being deppressed, like somehow it's an insult towards her 

Today she was talking to my grandma on the phone, and i heard her say that i ""act depressed"" 
i could hear my grandma suggest that ""maybe we should get him a terapist""
After that my mom laughed and told her that i don't need one and went on to talk for an hour about how much of a piece of shit i was.
That hurt pretty bad. I probaply was never going to ask for help from her, but now i know even if i did i wasn't going to get it. 

I think this was the final push over the edge
Im so done with this shit"
I have nothing left to give,7,mkt4wn,3,"I’ve always felt like life was hard for me to deal with when I was younger and as I got older, I my depression worsened to the point of multiple attempts at suicide and seconds thoughts about it as I was attempting. I finally got help last year and began to see a therapist and I’m on medication. It helped a little and then my wife decided she wanted a divorce. I lost my job two weeks later and I felt my whole world collapse around me. I had to sell my house, I had to move back with my parents and my family provided almost no support for me up front. My dad told me to grow up when I broke down in tears at the kitchen table after my wife decided to make it difficult to see my son. I don’t think I ever felt as low as I did in that moment. I ran up to my room and called my therapist and talked to him for a while. When I came back down, my mom told me not to run off like that again and not call my therapist when I had a little meltdown. She also said I shouldn’t waste my money on therapy. 

At this point, I’ve found employment with higher pay. I’m on track to get a good amount of money from selling my house and I’ll be able to find my own place soon. I feel totally hopeless and empty though because I don’t have that special someone that would be there for me no matter what. That someone who I can hug and feel protected. That someone who I can say I love you to and she will say it back. I know I’m still grieving over my marriage ending, but I want to have someone I can be with. I feel like a robot almost at work. I take adderall to focus at work and then I spend the rest of the evening and night methodically doing whatever else I need to do. To me now, marriage means nothing. Vows mean nothing. I honestly don’t want to get married again because I divorce is painfully long and expensive. I hate seeing couples in love, weddings make me sick and I really don’t want to be my best friend’s best man. All I want is someone to just love and accept me. I wouldn’t care if I never saw my family again if it meant I would never be without love again."
Does rock bottom end?,30,mkt2qh,4,"Every time I think it can’t get much worse, I can’t want to die more, feel anything more excruciating. 2 FUCKING WEEKS WITH NON STOP SUICIDAL THOUGHTS!! It’s never been this bad. I can’t stop thinking of ways to kill my self. The daydreams are getting more and more vivid. I feel like if I keep living (which I know I have to) something will change in me. Something bad. Help."
"Even if it will not fix everything, the lack of girlfriend hurt",15,mksvrt,2,"The first time I was in love was at five, and even as a child being not loved back as killing me inside since that time. I mean even as a child it is not surprising to suffer from that, it is simple, you love her, she don't love you. Ow I know it'll not fix everything etc... But the lack of affection, of having someone you love and love you, of hugs and caresses you give and receive it's really hard on the long term. The only few times(two in fact) I had a gf, it was the best feeling in the world and was the first time I was feeling completely happy and on the long term. Otherwise even at really good moments, like going to holidays with friends, it's cool, but there is always that ""it would be so much be better with girlfriend"", and the times I was with one yes it was so much better. The only thing I am left with is hope from time to time, it is cool the first three weeks, then it's okay but start hurting for a few weeks/months, then I get rejected and bam. I was so hopeful recently with a girl, even with the lockdown I had a lot of hope, I was even suprised that with the lockdown, not doing a lot of things, not seeing a lot of people I was happy and confident as fuck, she rejected me recently and since then... Fuck

And it's the only thing that gave me a real sense to life, even to unrelated things, I am in college and it motivate me to do homeworks, to work, otherwise I wonder ""why that""...

Need advise,1,mkss81,0,"I am suffering with depression all my life and have ptsd. I have tried  going to a psychiatrist for well over two years, but never really helped me. 

I dont se a point in life. I dont feel anything, beacuse nothing has real value to me. I just want to know how  to convince myself a good reason to live.


The only time i have feeot better is on drugs. Its the only time i really felt my emotions.

Help. I read my 10 year old sisters diary and found at she is suicidal. [SERIOUS],426,mksro9,44,"I know, i know. But before you trash me for reading her diary, i have to say she left it on my bed i guess by accident? And i had no idea it was her diary till i read it. What i found was that she thinks her family hates her because she has bad grades and she also talks about body image problems. To be clear, our family does not hate her,  but she does always cause trouble which means that she usually gets grounded. The big thing i found was a direct quote ""sometimes i wonder if it would make a difference if i was dead"". I dont know what to do from here. Should i tell her i read her diary and talk to her about it? Would that make it worse? Should i continue to read her diary so i can know if shes planing on killer herself? Im worried if i tell her i read her diary it would make her close up more, and itll be worse than before. I wanna reassure her that we love her, but if i tell her that shell know i read her diary because i have to hand the journal back to her since she left it in my room."
Maybe,1,mkspyk,0,"Maybe killing myself wouldn't be so bad?  I would leave my mom a little bit of money and she wouldn't have to deal with me and my shit any more.  But then I think of how she is and how she would be sad that her daughter killed herself.  Like she was a bad mother and it was her fault, it would affect her for the rest of her life.  I don't want to be the shitty person who did that to her, even though I already am such a shitty person.  What's one more thing?  And I wouldn't actually have to worry about it anymore because I'd be dead.  That doesn't mean that reality stops, though, and I know that.  She would continue even though I wouldn't.  It's so weird how negative emotions push me to want to kill myself every day yet these negative emotions (guilt) are what's keeping me from doing it.  

I should do it.  It's logical and reasonable for myself and for everyone around me, but somehow it's also not just because.  Because my mom might be sad or feel guilty.  That's not a good reason for me to not kill myself.  Is it?  And Im more concerned about how I would be a shitty person for doing it to her than her actually being sad, and that makes me an even shittier person.  I don't want to be like this I want to be good and nice and happy and okay but it's never going to happen I'm just a shitty person"
Defeated,3,mksmrm,0,"CW: toxic family, abuse, drugs, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts,  politics

If you comment assholery based on politics alone, shame on you, don't kick someone while they're down. 

I come from a toxic family, my father is an abusive meth head, and my mother has anxiety/depression, and allows shitty men to stay in her life, while also dipping in and out of drug habits. My father got custody of my little brother and I pre-meth, when I was 14 years old and brother was 8. I developed more anxiety and a deep depression living with him, him being verbally and mentally abusive, only physical on one occasion, and consistently being drunk. I wanted to kill myself at a young age, and nobody understood that I could be depressed, it just wasn't accepted as a real thing. My grandma (dad's mother) also lived there and backed my father and increased the abuse. I knew I had to leave, or I would kill myself, so I moved to a different state with my mother, who lived in a trailer park and was married to another verbally abusive man. Better than my father, because ""step-dad"" was a trucker and was barely there. They went through a divorce, and she wanted to move back home, and I couldn't do it. I emancipated myself and worked while finishing highschool. I moved in with my boyfriend at the time who turned out to be another abuser and raped me, I was in a cycle I could not escape. I finally found the right time to get away from that relationship, and started working different entry level jobs throughout the years. I wanted to make enough money to get custody of my brother and support us both, especially because my father became addicted to meth in that time. I did when I found a better steady job, and got him to live with me. Raising my younger brother was hard, but I gave it my best. I was living with roommates at the time, and when the pandemic and political turmoil hit, this put a lot of strain on everyone in that house. My brother was being talked to about politics without me knowing. The same politics my hate filled father spouted. I confronted the situation as best I could, trying to minimize the bad influence on my brother. He was getting more and more toxic though, and I didn't know what to do about it. He lied a lot, took money, even stole a car from a roommate. One night, he tolded me he wouldn't care if someone was a rapist, as long as he fit his ideals, he would still support them.  He said this with tue knowledge that I was raped. I couldn't do it anymore, he had just turned 18, so I kicked him out. It hurt so bad, because all I've ever wanted was to take care of him, but I couldn't stand what kind of person he became to me. I couldn't help seeing him just as I saw our father. That same week, my roommates wanted me out for being a strain on their mental health, even though I was alone in my room most of the time. I knew it was more than that, I wanted to be away from people anyway. So in a short span, I lost my brother, and two close friends. I live by myself, I'm terrified of making friends, my brother and I got better for a little while, but then eventually I was beibg taken advantage of again. I feel like I have nobody, and I'm too closed off to even try to connect. I feel so defeated, like my life has no purpose, I'm just perpetually working a repetitive and unfulfilling job, using up all my free time just to go home and be too tired to do anything. I'm scheduled for therapy but not until the end of this month, this will be my third time. Sometimes I feel like the trauma will kill me, through stress and an unfulfilling life.

Rant Incoming

Ever since in Middle School, I feel like I've put my parent's happiness ahead of my happiness. I've first encountered depression and Suicidal thoughts. I told my counselor and she contacted my Step-Dad (1st year for him of being a step-dad) and he came to my school. My dad called my mom, but she said she was too busy with her work to come and support me. After school, I told her my feelings about suicide and she basically reacted with ""lol"". Ever since then I've hated my mom and my life. In high school I was forced to do sports that I didn't want, and failed one of my classes (im a dumb cookie). We moved and I decided to get my shit together academically wise, not emotionally and mentally right. Granted I still saw my counselors, but that was no help tbh. I was getting good grades for the first time in my life. However, this was not enough for my mom's approval. She was asking: Why aren't you taking AP classes? Your friend or her friend's daughter or son got into a UC and you can only muster to get into CSUF? All my life and still am living for my family. I took 2 years of medical studies in HS because my mom and my family wanted me to take it, still did sports that I didn't want. On top of that constant verbal abuse from my mom like complaining how I wasn't good enough academically, how I was the reason for the divorce, and how I was the reason that we came to America. Constantly belittling me and my life. Now in CSUF, I major in CS which was 50/50 on major deciding. I'm a first year and I can tell you that I loath this major, but my mom and my grandparents are telling me to stay in it. This morning I decided I'm done fighting for myself and my happiness. I'm just going to live for my family, and in the future live for my wife.

Tbh, I'm just tired. Every night I'm restless because I'm stressed about my school (currently taking 16 creds, took 17 last sem) and my work that I work 20 to 21 hours a week, that I feel like suicide is the only way out and the only to tell my family that I'm was not happy. That for once in my terrible life they will listen. When I stab myself on the chest or my heart, I can die in peace and with a smile on my face. Finally being able to take something in my control in my life. I apologize for this graphic, but this is how I feel. However, I can't kms because even though I hate my fam, I can't do that to them. Even when I want to kms, I don't save myself because I love myself, but I don't do it for them.

I want to apologize for the long read and for wasting your guy's time if guys didnt want to read it. I just needed to get this out of my chest. This was my first post btw so its not that good 😅😅.

edit:I know its very selfish of me to rant about these small inconveniences, and I should be thankful for going to CSUF. Sometimes I am a gen-z snowflake,"
I'm almost done,5,mksaf3,3,"I really can't do it anymore. 

I moved to a new state last year to be closer to family and to accept a new job and to try and breathe life into an old relationship and give it a ""second go"". It all fell apart in 5 months. I was fired without cause from the job, lost the relationship partner a few weeks after that and have been unemployed for 8 months. 

I have interviewed tirelessly at companies with varying levels of success. No real offers still. There was one which I refer to as the ""platinum standard"" of positions that I have been in the running for since January '21. I completed FIVE interviews with them, and two online assessments and a submission of work samples. Found out today that they no longer want to move forward with me, despite all conversations feeling positive. 

Also just got a letter from a collection agency today for an amount owed from my prior apartment complex that I didn't know about because they misspelled my forwarding address in their system. So my credit score may take a massive hit even though I payed it in full immediately.

I'm completely emotionally drained. I feel like I'm lying to myself when I say things are going to get better. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up."
Barbie dream house,3,mksa5x,0,"Sitting in my childhood bedroom where I used to play with Barbie. high school musical and Hannah Montana posters on my wall. Journals full of lyrics and stories.an idea maybe I can be a rockstar too. Dancing to umbrella by Rihanna. 

Well I changed my room to another room and made this room my “study room”. I have a guitar in here my dad bought. Do you think I ever learned it? I have many notebooks full of poems, lyrics, stories. Do you think I’ll ever finish them? I have paint but my paintings aren’t very good. It’s April and I’m just now taking down the Christmas decor. I’ve refused to come in this room because it’s too hard for me to do school work. 

I’m going to school to be a teacher but I really don’t know. 

Out of nowhere, an unorganized mess surrounds me and tears fall out of me like waterfalls. I’ve been crying like this every night but now it’s 3 in the afternoon. I tried to reach out to a friend but I’m not anyone’s priorities may it be first, second, third. And everyone just ignored me. And even when I said I was sad I got no reaction. And today I say I’m doing good and want to try to talk and just have a normal conversation and have someone to talk to and I get ignored again by everyone. I just want someone to care about me like I care about them. But none of them do so I’m done and they can all depend on all their other options instead. It hurts being alone it’s not fair. I’m not close to family, friends, no one. And people always claim they’re here to talk. Well I tried and you weren’t there. So... yeah I’m done. 

I was thinking too, I’ve been asking God why I have no one and it appears he doesn’t listen either. So I don’t know really what the issue is. But .... I guess that’s my fucking life

And I keep telling myself it’s okay just focus on yourself and I try so hard to be a good version but... none of those dreams I always think about are happening. Schools not going well. Life’s not going well. So obviously nothing is working. I’ve been alone my whole life I would really appreciate it if I knew I had someone in this life.

This is the last time I am putting myself in this situation.,1,mkrh9f,2,"This is it. I (M20) have decided that I no longer want to live the way I have been living. Recently, my depression has gotten worse. It all started a few months ago when my grandmother was diagnosed with rapidly progressive ALS. Soon, she won't be able to speak at all. I have been depressed since Highschool, mainly due to bullying and the low self esteem that comes with that. My grandmother was and still is a huge influence on my life and I have a very close relationship with her. Although I'm not comfortable talking about how I am feeling with her currently, she knows that I am hurting which is comforting. 

However, even though I have accepted the fact that my grandmother is going to die within a few months to a year, it's making me extremely depressed and to be honest I am feeling quite overwhelmed. I tried talking about it with a few of my friends, but they basically just said ""That's fucked."" and left it at that, granted I probably didn't sound too upset as I tend to conceal my true emotions. 

School and Work definitely are not helping either, I work in a retirement community and seeing all of the residents there just makes my heart ache and reminds me of my grandma. School has been going okay, I found my assignments worryingly easy for me and thus I began to procrastinate as I shifted further into my depression. Although I get good marks, I am not happy with the content I am producing for my classes and am constantly critical of myself, I've lost countless marks for not showing up to present my work to online classes as I just feel like it isn't good enough. In fact, I am missing one as I type this. I've been barely eating, sleeping or taking care of myself in almost every capacity. 

But I've decided I'm not going to put myself in this position anymore. Instead of applying to go to college full time, overwhelming myself again and again I think I need to take some time. Most people say to keep going and just power through it. I'll be twenty soon, most people I've been talking to think it's too late to start college at 20. But, the way I see it is I can start whenever I damn well like to. I think I'm just going to work at a low income job, save my money, deal with my emotions and then hop back to it later. I don't understand why everybody thinks they have to get set up in life right away, and frankly it's annoying and makes me more depressed when people pressure me to do so.

Anyways, I probably talked a whole lot about nothing. Thanks for listening and all that you lot do on this sub. It's an amazing thing to watch humans connect like this.

TLDR: Grandma is dying, makes OP depressed, School seems to easy and makes me question if this is the path I want to pursue, job working with old people doesn't help the first problem. I'm gonna say fuck it, stop what I'm doing and reevaluate my life choices and do some deep thinking on how I am feeling."
I'm lonely,5,mkrdbp,0,"I dont take pleasure in talking with people but I need someone. I have no friends, no one I can really trust, no one I can be myself with... but at this stage I don't even really know who I am. This is killing me."

But boom covid. Boom promotion. Boom family member getting cancer. Boom friends leaving. Boom heart murmur. Boom my dad righting his wrongs. 

Not all are bad. But holy crap. My life was shit before these major responsibilities. And now I just don’t know how to do this. I can’t keep lying to myself and everyone else that I’m okay.

Im starting to think this actually will never end. And I don’t know how I’m going to make it."
i don’t know,1,mkr8ev,0,life is too exhausting. everything i say or do gets me in trouble or turned into a life lesson. i just tried to bring my dad outside with me and he ripped his arm out of mine and got mad at me. i don’t know what i did wrong i just wanted to spend time with him. i’m tired of trying to have fun with my parents and getting shut down. i just don’t understand what i’m doing wrong

I feel that no matter what I do I’ll never be able to carry on like a normal human,1,mkr331,0,"So I have depression, GAD, ADHD, endometriosis, a connective tissue disorder, am a cancer survivor, and come from an abusive home.

The list just seems to get longer as I get older. Meds have never helped much with any of the above. I see a therapist, I’ve tried supplements, exercise, neurofeedback, you name it. 

COVID has dramatically worsened all of this for me. The uncertainty has created so much additional executive dysfunction and even paying my bills regardless of whether or not I have the money to do so feels like more steps than I can handle. 

I live alone and work only part time. I’ll be taking on more responsibility and hours in a few weeks but I am scared because of how easily I get knocked down emotionally and physically. I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle it. 

I’m also afraid I’m unlovable because of how dysfunctional I am. I am dating someone and I am fearful if he saw the days where I cry in bed and can’t get up for hours, he’d never speak to me again. 

Today my landlord did some work in my yard (my yard is private) and it’s in the lease that he sometimes goes over there to do some maintenance stuff. My yard is on a bit of an incline and I don’t often walk up to the top but apparently my dog has popped up there 5 or so times in the past few days since I last checked for poop. 

My landlord sent me an extremely aggressive message about how disgusting the yard was and that it looks like I haven’t picked up anything from the yard since I moved in (every few days I go out there). He said my dogs paws were probably covered in feces (they’re not). He said I am violating the lease agreement and he won’t be warning me again but there will be dire consequences if this happens again (he never has warned me before).

Now I’m so happy to work to be more diligent about picking up after my dog and I went right out there and cleaned everything up. With my health issues, I’m not always as present as I should be. 100% valid criticism.

I told him I’m happy to be more diligent about it and appreciated him letting me know. I also said I felt a bit hurt by the way he expressed this to me and that I didn’t mean to upset him or his partner (my other landlord is his girlfriend) in any way.

His response was that he didn’t care about how I felt and he said there was nothing wrong with how he expressed himself.

From there I just let it go but this majorly triggered hyper vigilance in me as someone who comes from abuse. My dad used to speak to me this way. I have been crying for over an hour now and I just hate that I get so knocked down by stuff like this. 

Like I said, I know he was within his rights to be upset and I should be doing better, but his words made me feel so afraid and unsafe. He lives in the unit next door and can see me from my yard so it took so much courage for me to even get outside to pick up after my dog. But I do want to say it was absolutely only a few days of poop. It was certainly not 45 days worth which is how long ago I moved in. 

I’m not looking for advice and certainly not judgment please. Just hopefully someone here understands how difficult it is to feel so triggered because of past abuse and mental/physical health struggles. I really wish I wasn’t like this and that I could just take the constructive part of his message and leave the rest. But it’s so hard for me to do that sometimes. 

Since picking up after my doggie, I made an appointment with my therapist and chatted with a friend. Now I’m just trying to allow myself to cry it out as that seems to be what I need right now."
My dad is too strict over corona,3,mkr29v,2,"I know this corona thing is serious but i feel like my dad has taken it too far. The last time i saw any of my friends was back in mid January when i finished my exams, since then i have went out once with 1 of my friends and the reason i went was to get my mom a birthday gift for her birthday, which he started to yell at me at for and telling me you don't have to get her a gift.

I only leave the house once or twice a month to help my mom with groceries, i dont take off my mask at all, wear gloves and stay from everyone idk. I know he is doing this because he is afraid of it but both him and my mom have been vaccinated.

I'm talking about this because i just went to tell him i wanna go out with 2 friends (who like wise barely go out) to some flat empty land on top of a hill far from eveyone. He proceeded to yell at me and tell me no i cant because go, i told him i chose there because it's far from anyone else due to the corona thing. I told him it's also for my mental health as all my siblings are studying abroad, i havent seen anyone in months and all i do is just sit in my room, he told me to not make this dramatic and go cry about it.

What do i do?

Tldr; my dad is overally strict about corona to the point i havent left the house in months"
realization,3,mkqvp3,0,i think one of the worst parts or experiences of depression is having the realization you will never truly be 100% happy again. it’s like a an orbit of feeling uplifted just to fall back down. it makes you really pause and think and acknowledge what and who you are. might just be a random messy thought but i know personally for me it hurts every time the realization comes back.
"Feeling stuck, just need to vent",1,mkqufh,1,"I’m a senior in college who is working 30 hours a week and taking 5 classes. I’m so burnt out! I feel like I have no time but I could really use the money and I’m too anxious to speak to my manager about it...

I’m also realizing that I have been in a depressive episode for over a week now. I have not felt like myself in a while, but I don’t think any of it is bc of my medication. My appetite is shitty and when I’m not on my ADHD medication, I am so lethargic that I sleep through the day. I’m irritable and can’t hold a conversation and feeling awkward. This is so not who I am. I hate feeling annoyed by everything and having no motivation to do schoolwork. And I feel so lonely. I love my roommates and I have great friends and family. 

I’m extremely lucky, so why do I still feel alone and isolated? 

Why do I have no hope for my future, and why can’t I stop comparing myself to the friend of mine who is 3 years older, has all of the social and systemic advantages in his favor, and is going to Columbia Law? This is so ridiculous and embarrassing ahhhh I can’t believe I’m typing that out.

Side note, I wish my coworkers would stop asking me out!!! But I don’t know how to say no, and I don’t know why I can’t say no 😭

Maybe I’m smoking too much weed? it’s the only thing that calms down my physical anxiety and makes me feel social. I feel so shameful that I’ve been smoking once a day now. 

Thank you for reading, my mind is all over the place!"
i never thought it would get this low,4,mkqpds,0,"a few weeks ago i was hospitalized and put on new meds and they’re not working that great. i feel like at this point my brain is immune to antidepressants. my life is so incredibly boring and mundane but at the same time i get over-stimulated super fast and can’t deal with stress. 
i’ve been thinking about trying drugs for the first time just to feel something other than numbness, except i’m broke and don’t know where to find dealers. 
i’m so sick of living it’s gotten to a point where i feel like fuck it all. i don’t have a purpose in life and feel like human waste and i’m just waiting to die so i can travel to a new planet."
it isn't getting better,5,mkqnwc,0,"i consistently see ""it gets better"" as the slogan for all kinds of mental health issues. but what do you do if it doesn't, or if better isn't good enough? every day i feel as bad as the day before, but the fact that ""it"" is not getting ""better"" makes the same thing every day feel like something worse each day that passes. it makes me feel like something is wrong with me when nothing has gotten better for years. when it's always the same grinding slog no matter what i do. i'm doing everything i can, really. i broke down the other day, and i contacted one of the helplines, saying basically this, and they suggested a bunch of things that i already try to do, things that only keep me barely clinging on. what do you do if all the resources in the world only keep you holding on to life for dear life?  what do you do if your ""better"" still isn't good enough? the responder said that sometimes good enough is all you can do, and i guess that's true, but what if your good enough isn't enough to you know, get you money to eat? at this rate i'm going to lose my job, because i just can't do the work anymore even though i'm trying so hard, and i've already maxed out asking my friends for help, and they all have their own shit already. every therapist close by is booked--pandemics are stressful i guess--and as every day goes by, as ""good"" never comes, i feel like i'm never going to get there. and what really is the point of trying so hard when nothing that you do even lets you approach the basic degree of functioning expected for being a member of society?"
Plz don't hate me for saying this but,3,mkqmfq,0,"Just before I say what I want to say, I just wanted to say that I do not consider myself the kind of person who wallows in self pity or feels particularly sorry for themselves. If anything most of the time I would say I am quite tough minded with my depression and anxiety, in that if I'm feeling crap instead of letting myself feel sad I will tell myself that I just need to push on through with my mental health and that there's no time for crying or getting upset. I'm not saying crying or getting upset means that you are a self pitying person because 99% of the time that isn't true, but just for me the way my brain makes me feel is that obviously if I cry that means that I'm letting my anxiety and depression make me feel unhappy and sorry for myself, because my brain makes me feel like emotionally strong people would constantly be optimistic even if they were feeling suicidal, and they would be able to smile through their depression or laugh at their own problems. That probably sounds fucked and people are probably going to hate me for saying that but that's just what my brain is telling me at the moment. But even though I know so many people experience depression or suicidal thoughts/ideation every/most days, and some people will read this and think ""yea well life isn't fair get over it"", and I know I probably sound like a three year old saying this but to be honest, I think it doesn't matter how many people in the world have depression or suicidal thoughts, to put it simply, having depression which for many people feels like a try not to die challenge, if it sounds naive I'm sorry but for someone to have to question wether they should kill themselves most days that doesn't strike me as being very fair. Yes a lot of people have depression but even in the world today, there are still a lot of people who haven't got depression or suicidal thoughts and I think it's actually quite toxic if anyone ever feels like it's okay to make someone feel like they're not allowed to feel sorry for themselves because they're feeling depressed/suicidal, just because lots of other people also feel the same. Like you wouldn't tell someone who had been diagnosed with cancer that they shouldn't feel sad or sorry for themselves just because lots of people in the world have cancer"
Wishing to know more about the different types of SSRI medications!,3,mkqkhm,5,"Someone commented on my Luvox thread I created and told me: 

> What's special about Fluvoxamine compared to other SSRI is it's very high affinity for the sigma receptor, which is related to anti-anxiety/depression affects. Other SSRIs don't have that level of sigma receptor agonism.

What are some of the other different SSRI meds and what makes them special? I want to change my med to zoloft because I heard it doesn't cause weight gain but I don't know anything else about it.

Can someone provide any helpful info about any other SSRI meds like the helpful gentleman in my thread yesterday I quoted?"
Damn almost cried at work,1,mkqk71,0,"I grew up in a house where my father would get tore down drunk and then yell at my mother or us kids because the house wasn’t spotless. Dinner was made, kitchen was cleaned up, dishwasher had been ran and then unloaded, dishes were out up, bathroom was clean, living room was clean, my sister and my room was not but whatevs. So he would yell and yell and yell. 

Well today my boss got really mad at something my coworker did. We all thought we were all on the same page from last Wednesday. Apparently boss man wasn’t. So my coworker did what we both thought was correct....it wasn’t. 

So today we get to work ACs in server room are not working so what’s supposed to be 70 degrees is over 100. The camera server crapped out again. The security pc crapped out again. And we couldn’t log into a laptop with the vpn that had been created last week. So tension is rising. And then my coworker told boss man what he did in Active Directory and the yelling commended. 

I literally almost had a panic attack and had to turn my chair around and do some breathing exercises to calm down. Luckily no one noticed this. That would have been weird had they. But ya so today I almost came real close to crying at work. 

And I’m on new psych meds and so I’m pretty bummed already. Not feeling great and I’m one small tear away from having to have rotator cuff surgery and it was a work related injury but I thought I just pulled a muscle so I didn’t do workman’s comp. so now 3 months later and finally went to doc I find out my bursa sac is completely inflamed and I have a gnarly tear on one of the tendons and I can’t afford PT or surgery so I’m doing at home PT and still trying to work cuz my dumb ass doesn’t have time to take off. 

This has been great!"
Films and TV,1,mkqgel,0,"Do you find that when you're in this downward spiral of sadness you're so numb you don't want to do anything whether the sun is shining or not. I can't help but think, if I was stood in a lovely scenic location why would that suddenly make me feel better?

All I find myself doing is staying inside and watching films. I was watching Cinema Paradiso today and the romance on screen was so beautiful it made me cry, not only just because I don't have that, but also because film is better than reality. You're seeing life with all the boring bits edited out. Life is long, repetitive, mundane and pointless. Just constant sadness and then as you get older life finds new ways to remind you how good you had it, until the punchline of death.

Why do people have children, when all they get is pain punctuated by boredom. I'm so fucking alone, I hate this shit.

Fuck it"
Back into depression 1 year after breakup,1,mkqett,0,"I don't know it this is the right corner of reddit for it.

However I just feel like writing it down, and maybe get some emotional support..

&#x200B;

I'm 23M and I struggled with a heavy depression before, about 6-7 years ago, mostly due to working a really bad job.

I'm not the kind of person to get help. I really don't know how I got out of it last time. But I just was eventually, I quite the job, and had people to kind help me through.

&#x200B;

One of the people would become my GF for 5 years. It was a long distance relationship it wasn't the best but we loved each other very much. I took the relationship for to granted, and I think I was just to young to figure out what I wanted in my life and couldn't decide how important she was to me.

So we broke up about a year ago, after she told me she felt trapped, and that I wasn't committed enough. However the bad things leading to now just began.

Due to us being best friends before and texting daily for 8 years we just continued.

This lead to me not realizing that we really broke up. And me logically mind knew, having her reasoning behind the break up in mind that I wouldn't be a good thing for us getting back together.

So when she tried to get back to getter multiple times in summer of last year I rejected her. Having her best interested in mind.

In Winter we texted less and I had a vacation from my very demanding job and got to thing about life.

Figured out that I'm a foul. That I gave away a great thing, and that I just should have done more.

Guess what - when I told her all of that she told me that she had moved on.

However I kept trying and reestablishing a relationship. We began spending more time together (online) and again talking more.

Looking at right now: she had her first date 2 days ago, and it sounds like she spent the night which just destroys me.

&#x200B;

I also tried to move on. But it doesn't seem to work. I cant stop thinking about her. And the bad thing is that we are still texting. I know that this part is so stupid. But I also feel like I just cant let this person go. She was such are integral part of my life for sooo long, at such a young age.

&#x200B;

And all this leads to the depression part. Which is the one I'm really struggling with.

I think I got a low key depression for a while now. Maybe for over 1.5 years. Meaning that I cant enjoy things, cant concentrate on small things, am restless all the time, and just don't feel happy. Also my current job just isn't as satisfying as it used to be and a lot of people I liked at work quit during corona. I cant excise any of my hobbies at the moment due to everything being closed due to covid, besides gaming. I do enjoy gaming while I'm doing it but afterwards I just feel guilty about wasting time.

&#x200B;

I just feel like I'm never going to be happy again. That I will die alone, that I wasted everything, and the only one who is to blame is myself. The depression hits the hardest at night. I cant sleep. I just don't want to endure it anymore, and I don't know how to get out of this. I have no one to talk to about this. My friends just make jokes about those kind of things, same with my family. I'm also super uncomfortable talking about my life to people that know me.

&#x200B;

Of course my conscious mind knows that I will eventually get out of this. That depression is temporary and life can be wonderful. But this of course doesn't do shit for me right now. Everything just hurts. And I feel alone and awful. I try my best with the run of the mil Antidepressant tools like: exercising, eating healthy, going for walks and taking vitamin D (Which helped a ton with seasonal depression which I also experienced a couple of times.) I think my only option is to suffer though it and hope for the best that I doesn't get worse.

&#x200B;

I know that here a people who have it so much worse than I do. And I feel really bad complaining.

&#x200B;

And I apologize for any typos, spelling or grammatical errors. English is my 2nd language.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading if you came this far."
I need more opinions about this,2,mkqe25,2,"Hi, I want to ask about your opinions about this, I think I’m depressed but is not constant so I think it might be bipolarity, I don’t try to diagnose myself but I asked for help to my parents and they said it’s enough to know you’re depressed to get out of it, besides that, my parents (more my dad) abuse of us psychologically, he says me and my brother are lazy, we just don’t want to do things but i try my best every time I can, sometimes my motivation or my mood doesn’t let me but i really try, I had an argument with my parents about it and got out of my house for a month, they said they were gonna change so I went back home and now my dad treat me different since that. My dad is someone that always thinks he’s right, he’s so proud and super smart too but I think he uses that to manipulate us (me and my mom specially) so I have (kinda) the opportunity to get out again but this time my dad won’t let me come back never again unless he goes away, so... to not make this so long... there are good days and bad days but the mental health of everyone is there, the pressure and the constant stress is so common with my parents, so, should I just go now? (My dad also said if I loose the job he’ll kick me out anyways so I tough about just go )"
Weird sudden bursts of happiness,2,mkqbab,1,Does anyone know why I get sudden burst of happiness like they last for 10 minutes? I tend to get very jittery.
Degeneration,2,mkq663,0,"I feel a sense of degeneration in many areas of my life and do not know what to do.

During the coronavirus pandemic, so much just seemed to fall apart or get worse. After I recovered from a big bout of depression three years ago, I started excelling in school. This last year, all my classes were online. I went from being genuinely passionate about subjects, to wanting to just max out grades, to wanting to pass, to not caring and just wanting to be done.  I made bad mistakes at work and am falling behind in a class. I will almost definitely pass all my classes based on my previous semester work alone, but what comes after school in 3 weeks? I have lost almost all of my previous college friendships that I carefully built. I fear COVID and did not leave my dorm almost ever. I keep thinking COVID will get better in a few months, but a few months comes and it does not. I must leave my dorm in just a couple of weeks and go into uncertainty.

Family wise, everything got worse after my mom died. The glue that held us together. I have an alcoholic father who has what most people would call a major anger explosion every hour he is not drunk or asleep during the day. My little sisters act out horribly with friends and are barely scraping along in online school. My niece has an inoperable brain tumor. I cannot do anything about this. I have tried, but it always goes back to a bad state. You cannot fix a death or replace a critical broken part.

Health wise, I recieved very bad news from an orthopedist a couple of weeks ago. I am 22 with cartilage damage in my knees and a connective tissue disorder. People used to think I had a superpower with my ability to bend my joints, but now ignorance has turned ability into disability. I hurt myself, and cannot go back in the past to fix things. It tends to be degenerative with almost universal rates of chronic pain. I look into my future and think if I would want to be around anymore. I wonder if it is justified to quit if there is more pain than pleasure received from life. At what point is this? I have felt this way in the past. I set morbid deadlines for myself (e.g. I will give it one more month before being done), but I would always procrastinate until the next one or find a little something to hang around for longer. I have physical therapy tomorrow, and figure I can stick around to try it.

My relationships are pretty much gone. I just ended things with my boyfriend, who was one of the last things that made me happy. He was too much rolled into one. A lover, a best friend, 2-3 close friends, a brother, an enemy, an ally. I would spend 75%+ my social time with him. It is unfair to place the burden of an entire support system on one person. I went from being a good influence on him academically and socially, to being a destructive bad influence changing him. And I was slipping. Depression slowly absorbed my interests in music, history and political science (my majors) and now my love. One thing after the other slipped into oblivion. I felt I had to leave before I degenerated further. I hated the uncertainty of the future we had, but I still wonder about the future I have closed off. It would have gotten worse though. I feel like I have the potential to help others, but have mad eit worse so many times.

I look into the past and think of my childhood being near perfect. Almost idyllic. But everything seems to be objectively worse since then. Some of the degeneration is from forces beyond my control. Some of it is due to the choices I have made. I look into the past and see happiness followed by mistakes and feel remorse. I look into the future and see nothing but haze and thousands of scenarios. Some of these futures I am not in at various points. I despise uncertainty and it fuels my anxiety. I do not seem to live in the present. I know this is the best thing to do, it is what people tell me to do, but I cannot. Everything has the potential to get worse. To degenerate."

I wish I killed myself earlier,175,mkpo20,20,"this is very much related to school and grades, just a heads up

before you think I'm being selfish, it's the opposite really. all I ever do is cause pain and trouble. literally just wasting my parent's money which they made clear several times.
I attempted suicide in 7th grade, my biggest regret is that it didn't work, I regret not killing myself before going to therapy and fixing my relationship with my family, it would've been so much easier for everyone by now. my friends would've been over me already and moving on with their lives, my parents have my older sister to keep them happy and care for them when they get older, she's well on her way to get a stable job so I don't have to worry about her
I know it would be tough on my friends, especially my best friend, but she'll understand. she'll forgive me because she knows I'm too weak to survive any longer. she won't blame me, at least nor for a long time.

things are terrible now, I'm a senior in high school and I failed my primarily exams, in a few months I take the main ""big"" exams which determine if I go to a good college or not

I've been feeling like a failure for a long time now and no one takes the effort to make me think otherwise, my failing grades are always a great proof too. 

I used to blame my depression, but I really don't have the right to do that, I've always been lazy and bad at school, mental illness only made them worse.. it didn't make me a failure, it just proved it further.

I live in a big house, I'm healthy and my parents are financially just ok.i have the luxury of going to therapy once every few months and taking antidepressants. I know people who have a 100x worse living situation than me yet they do amazing in school, my cousin have abusive parents, live in a shitty small house in a bad area, is most likely depressed and can never go to a therapist, yet she's excelling academically. and that's just one example.

I know I probably sound overdramatic, selfish, lazy.

I know I am.
I'm also weak, too weak to live anymore. 

for the first time in a long time, I got the urge to starve myself and inflict self harm on myself, but I'm trying my best not to follow them.

I feel like it's too late to kill myself now, it will hurt my friends and I love them too much to do that.. but I feel like I deserve to do something for myself, just for once.

I probably won't do it soon because I'm scared of failing,if my parents found out it would be a big scandal and a shame to them..

I'm not sure if anyone would bother to read and respond to this, i sure wouldn't. but I needed to write this out.."
i think i might be developing depression,2,mkpmuq,0,"it's been happening for a while, but it's particularly bad today.

for context, i'm a freshman in high school and i feel like my mental health is slowly going downhill. i have no motivation. i'm exhausted constantly and i just feel like i hate everything school-related. there's only one thing that makes me happy- a piece of online fiction that updates once a week. i feel as if i'm living the same day over and over and it's the only thing that's different. i'm tired. i'm so tired. i can't focus or snap my brain out of this haze.

to top it off, there's no way in hell that i'm going to tell anyone. i have issues conveying my emotions and problems to my family as the feeling of vulnerability has only ever made it worse. it feels awful- like i'm sick to my stomach just from it. i have two friends and they're both over the internet. 

i've started to worry a lot more about the lives of my family. i rarely ever worry about myself. i want to go outside. i want freedom. i constantly feel like i'm going to cry.

i don't know. part of me is worried that i'm one of those teenagers who fake mental illness for attention. it feels real to me. i've started to relate more to sad music, which i know seems trivial, but i never did that before.

i don't think i'm going to kill myself. i wouldn't do that to my family, but i have been thinking more about it lately. how great it would be to just disappear like i never existed. nobody remembers me, because i was never there. nobody mourns, nobody cries."
I'm a failure. And I'm tired of doing anything to change it.,8,mkpifn,1,"I tried. Many times. I'm tired. I tried to do my best. At my job
Or making art. Or keeping meaningful connections w others. I feel useless, weak and stupid. I loved my job - my boss decided it's not important and i was moved to another position. Which i hated. Nevertheless I worked hard. I was considered one of the best employees. Eventually burnt out to the point of mental breakdown. I tried to find myself somewhere outside an office job. Worked as a photographer for a magazine - hardly can earn enough to eat and pay bills. Also, I've been drawing stuff for several years alongside working my regular job. Ppl constantly told me to monetize my art. I tried. Again and again. And i failed. Again and again. Well, i hate digital art, also I don't draw furries or whatever. I always dreamt of illustrating children's books. I tried to contact many publishers and authors - they either ghosted me or responded smth like we'll call you if we need you. I feel desperate. Currently im financially depend on my boyfriend and he's ok with that, also my brother helps me with money, but this is so embarrassing. Im 30. No kids to feed at least. Instead, depression, social anxiety, schizotypal + bipolar 2. Sometimes I can't make myself leave the house. Talk to someone, even to my mom. Thinking abt working with ppl and around ppl scares the shit out of me. I can't imagine doing back to the office. Or at least at a job interview. I'm so tired. I feel useless. Embarrassed. Lost. But have no energy to do smth about it. I'm disappointed with myself. Medication doesn't help with this."
Trouble Maintaining Erection on fluoxetine,1,mkpdtt,0,"I've been on Prozac for around a month now. It's been rather tough maintaining an erection as well as attaining orgasm. This has been rather frustrating, so I've begun tapering it out over the next 2 weeks.

I need help. Here’s my story.,12,mkp8gt,5,"I need help. 

I hope no one minds if I tell my story. I have no one to talk to about this, and I feel like writing it out might help me. 

I am severely depressed and suicidal. It all started with me moving away for college last summer. I was in a good headspace at the time. Over the Summer, I had become close friends with one of my neighbors. We hung out almost everyday and it made me feel like a normal person. Things were also going well with my long distance girlfriend of three years. I was feeling like my life was finally getting back on track after a lot of past trauma such as false rape accusations and friends that were like brothers turning on me. I had hope for the future. I moved into a small house off of campus, and everything started to go downhill from there. I was so lonely. I didn’t know anyone in that town. Due to covid, everything with my school was online. I didn’t leave the house except to buy food and to visit my girlfriend once every two weeks. I basically stayed in my small room for 6 months straight. My close friend called me, and asked me if I hung out with anyone besides him. I told him no and explained why. He hung up and ghosted me after that. My mental health was rapidly deteriorating. My anxiety was horrible, and panic attacks were becoming more and more frequent. I thought of suicide every day. As my mental health deteriorated, so did my relationship with my girlfriend. I was constantly paranoid about something happening to her. I became obsessive. She was all I had, so I became way too reliant on her. Everything she did got to me. She had lots of friends, and the time she was willing to spend texting or calling me was decreasing. She seemed disinterested in me and didn’t want to talk about my mental health issues. She barely told me she loved me or complimented me anymore. I became absolutely pathetic. I lashed out a lot, and we had a lot of fights. She would call me insane and lots of other names. It destroyed me. I realized that if this relationship continued, I was going to end up killing myself. I told my parents about the situation and they asked me to move back home for my own safety. I ended things and we actually managed to go out peacefully and on good terms. This gave me a lot of inner peace. She said she really wanted to be friends eventually and to reach out if I ever needed her. I made some progress with myself after that. I got a job, started exercising, tanning, and became a vegetarian. Fast forward two months and she blocked me on snapchat. I’m not really sure when it happened because I had my social media’s deleted for a while. I decided to ignore it, but it really hurt me. It felt like all the progress I made in getting over her just disappeared. I just couldn’t manage to get it off of my mind. Why would she do this after we ended things so peacefully and she told me all these nice things. I didn’t do anything that could possibly upset her since we broke up. This weighed on me heavily for a few days. Last night, after not being able to sleep because of it, I texted her and asked her why she blocked me. She hasn’t responded. I feel pathetic for reaching out to her, and terrified that the woman who was once everything to me, now hates me. I feel like everyone hates me. I don’t know what to do and I could really use some kind words or encouragement. If you read all of this, thank you for listening to my story."
I think I could use a human electroshock.,2,mkp6gq,0,"I have had this feeling of being stuck in inertia. Like wanting to move forward but not having enough motivation. It's my fantasy. Someone to come and push me. Put me electricity. Smiles, pushes, drags, sky and sun.

Someone who gives me a little rope to walk again. I shouldn't and know I should depend only on myself, but from time to time, one longs for it.

 I have to find a way to charge my battery myself. When I do I will completely forget about all this."
My mom plays the victim when I try to ask for help with my depression.,20,mkp5h3,6,"There’s not a lot to say. I’ve brought it up 2 times with her. Both times she has started calling herself such a bad mother for not noticing, but it never lead any further than us talking about it for a bit and then leaving it at that. The common thing about both talks was that she would start saying what a bad mother she is, how badly she’s raised her children and overall just sounding like the victim in the whole situation. I just want to get some help, but I don’t know how to ask her since it never leads to anything. I can’t pay for therapy myself so I need to ask her. Is there any way to convince her or are there any alternative ways I could get help.
Thank you in advance."
What to do when you feel a depressive episode coming on?,6,mkp3dk,3,"I've been okay since a particularly bad bout of depression in February, but I can almost feel another depressive episode coming on again. Some of my coping mechanisms that work well are exercise, sobriety, mindfulness and keeping myself well nourished with healthy foods. I know I shouldn't try to fight it off, and I must accept these feelings, but I hate it so much and just want to find a way to lessen the blow."
I need help to get help,3,mkp0yu,0,"I've been trying to reach out for help but my parents don't understand when I tell them I don't want to talk about the specific causes with them and that I want to go to a psychologist. Especially my mother looks at me weirdly and tells me ""I think that's strange \[that you don't want to tell me what happened\]"". They are disappointed because I can't manage to finish my final thesis, or clean my room, or other things I have to do. I've called a psychologist, which took a lot effort and a friend of mine videocalling me at the same time so that I wouldn't be alone. At least I managed to call, right? But my call went straight to voicemail / answering machine. I left my contact details and asked for help and they called me back a day after just to tell me they didn't had an appointment for new patients until beginning of July. And now I cannot push myself to call anybody else or ask my parents for help, just because my previous experiences have been so frustratingly unhelpful. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm in a really dark place right now."

Saturday School,2,mkoxj4,0,"Preread: 
I’ve always had these, but have recently been having very very bad anxiety, loneliness, pessimism, and depression (including severe adhd) to the point of it paralyzing me so I can’t leave my bed some days. My school is also having “in-school” learning, which I think is absolutely fucking stupid, and I’ve tried to open up about my thoughts about it to my parents, and asked them to transfer me to at least “at-home” learning, but they said no, which is whatever. Also, this is a rant, it’s gunna be very mixed around, and I am horrible at segways, so yeah.

Anyways, I’ve missed so many days of school, and have been called to the assistant principal’s office multiple times, and now, just a few minutes ago, she told me that I will have to take 16 hours of saturday school, which starts when normal school starts. I also have 2 0’s in two of my classes, and failing 3 of them. And guess what? I COULDN’T FUCKING CARE LESS. I’m not usually a “rude” person, quite the opposite actually, I’m painfully indifferent, BUT OH MY GOD. Why don’t people just accept that some people can’t function some days, and just let them be? I wish that they could get a sight into my neurodivergency, but whatever. It’s all whatever, everything here is whatever. I hate making my own choices, so W H A T E V E R.  I honestly can’t do it anymore, not gunna commit the bad thing, because I don’t wanna hurt the people that “care”, but if (as cliché as it is) a car were coming at me, I wouldn’t move out of the way. I wish nothing mattered, I wish we could go back to being stupid meatbags that struggle through life through different means than that of fucking school. I hate life, love, and everything in between, but I still care for people that say they “care”, because I’m stupid. 

I don’t know why I made this, nobody wants to know. I dont want comfort either, nor attention, but whatever. This is the first of many choices that I am going to force myself to make, even if I delete it as soon as I post it. I hope you have a nice day whoever had the time to read this."
i feel like im running out of time,24,mkoxdb,4,"im turning 21 soon and im still living with my parents jobless and friendless in college. i thought that by now things would be better for me. it is so disappointing to see myself look and act this way because throughout my childhood, people have expected great things from me. i avoid my old friends because i feel so horrible about myself and i really dont think i can face them. i only use social media for important matters but it still fucking hurts to see my peers grow into themselves. im turning 21 without an identity, no longer interested in my old hobbies,  with a heart as hard as a rock. i wish i could get treatment because im tired of living this way."
I was doing so well and I just slipped up,10,mkorbu,1,I don’t even know what’s wrong with me I was doing great doing what I had to do making an effort with life . Then everything just stopped and I fell back in the deep dark hole. I’ve been over eating badly and staying in bed all they I have no motivation to do anything. I cut my hair during an episode last night and I hate myself so much for it and I’ve been eating so freaking much on top of all that. I am back to school next week I am so scared I just hope I’m able to get through it because there’s only 2 more months left
No matter what u do... It sucks...,4,mkorap,0,"Am literally fed up of this life... No matter what the fuck I do I still get fed up and only one thing comes in mind..... Pulling plug of my life that's it......

Getting worse.,4,mkopj4,8,"Hi, I don’t really know where to begin with this or how to phrase it but here goes. I’ve been depressed since I was around 17, I’m now 23, in those 6 or so years I’ve felt incredibly low, trying to take my life twice. I’ve also felt better more recently after going to therapy and finding a medication that worked for me. However, I’m getting worse again

I have been out of work due to the pandemic which I don’t think has helped with there being pretty much no routine but I just wake up every day thinking there’s no point in living anymore, my intrusive thoughts are getting worse by the day and I don’t really know what to do. I keep thinking the pandemic will be better soon and things will return to a more normal way of being but now the thought of that gives me severe anxiety. I have people around me I can talk to but I feel like if I say to them how I’m feeling then they’ll get worried, I’ve already put them through so much and they don’t deserve it

I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I guess I just had to tell someone"
How can someone be in a relationship when they have mental health issues?,12,mkopca,6," After threading several subreddits discussing social skills, making friendship, etc, I find it rather puzzling how someone who claims to have mental health issues (ranging from social anxiety, depression, avoidance disorder, etc) can have a partner.

I have a social anxiety and have fallen into depression during pandemic, although I'm now on meds and practising many exercises to get better. Although I have been on several dates, I found that my mental health disturbance had played a big part in the failures of all those. I'm now rather scared to date again and keep saying to myself that I should heal first. However, part of healing and reducing social anxiety (also loneliness that causes me depression) is by meeting more people and put myself in uncomfortable situations, including meeting someone new and willing to be vulnerable.

That's been said, I wonder if it's ever a good idea to start dating random people again? And how can someone who has social anxiety and depression gets a partner?"
Feel like I've let my parents down,1,mkokk8,4,I turned 33 last week. I'm unemployed with two degrees and no direction. I never really made the transition to adult life and I've been lost ever since.
Unsure what to do now.,4,mkociu,4,"I've posted here before, and I just really want to get these thoughts out of my mind and off my chest. I honestly don't mind if no one answers, I've come to accept and fully believe no one understands me

I'm not poor anymore, I'm not struggling to buy whatever I want whenever I want, I have a loving family, I have a wonderful girlfriend, I have amazing friends, I'm trying to practice to be more religious but there is a sensation running in me, one that I absolutely hate, I'm so depressed

Ever since I was young in high school, I've been putting myself in the position of a victim of circumstances, and now that I finally changed that, a part of me desperately wants to be degraded, to feel lower, to feel. powerless, so feel looked down upon, because that's how I felt growing up. I keep desiring to be hated, to be disappointed by people's action, to be left alone in the corner. I'm grateful for so much, I really am, but I want to be one people look at with disgust, that people find annoying to be around.

I want to be alone, I want to be enviously looking at others thinking I wish I have what they do, even when I'm in a perfectly normal position in life. I can't help this desire to want to have that aching pain in my chest. I enviously want to have a trophy wife who I can flaunt and say I deserve her for all my struggles and pain. Someone with a stunning body desired by any man who sees her with envy towards me just like how I do at other men. An expensive car that I can flex at all those who laugh at me. A lavish house where I feel empty. I constantly turn to porn and sex to fill the emptiness.

I know it sounds like I have a mental problem, I'm completely aware, I can't see a therapist, because then I'd be using part of my savings, and people would get concerned about where all my money is going. I can't speak about it to anyone but the wall in my room hoping I'll just forget the next morning and continue until I have my next mental breakdown again. I want to rot away in my room, I want to stop pretending like I'm some perfect human being who's always nice, intelligent, and creative. I just want to be sad in a corner with pity being thrown at me like scraps. I want people to be disappointed in me for all the bad things they don't know I've done. For all the people I've hurt just because I didn't get what I want and how I wanted it.

I have every desire to die alone pretending like I fought the most difficult struggle there is and I can finally rest. I go on PornHub and Chaturbate, looking for reasons to be depressed, desiring things that I shouldn't. I keep forcing myself into these delusions that I'm depressed and I start crying by myself being angry at myself for being such a disgusting human being in the first place. I don't want to change, I never wanted to change, I just wanted to die so that I can stop being such a sick fuck and not continue to hurt those around by having this fucking mental problem anymore."
"I'm so damn aimless, everything is hard and bad to me...",1,mkoc4n,0,"I don't know where to start honestly. I keep thinking that I've been born in the wrong life or something. Nearly everything is just bad or hard for me. My body is a cunt and loves giving me pain every day for no apparent reason. I'm relatively close to finishing school, but before me comes by far the most difficult school time of my life for like an entire year, pretty much all of my friends annoy me in one way or another, I'm constantly dealing with porn addiction and beat myself up mentally whenever I fail. I love physical work, the gym (which is closed thanks to covid) was pretty much heaven on earth for me, the thought of having a simple, manual labor job is great to me, but everyone in my family, friends etc says that I have to finish the highest form of school where I live, and I just so happen to live in a country where the difficulty of school is utter bullshit (and that's a well known fact where I live, not something that I only perceive that way). I keep wondering, why even do all that? I don't need a huge house, the best paying job, the highest rank in society. I just want to live peacefully, honestly a minimalism lifestyle appeals a lot to me. I'm so damn unhappy with my life, nearly everything seems to work against me, and I'm just tired of having to care. I'm not suicidal at all, but I sometimes feel so dead inside."
Struggle,1,mkoaed,0,"So kinda fell into this recently. Was in an ok but lack luster relationship. Ended that, my choice. Going back to trying to work on myself but I have no motivation.

Dilemma Update,1,mkoa8b,0,I have felt pretty normal over the last couple of days. I want to go see someone but I also don’t want anyone to know because this wouldn’t be the first time I seen a professional for this.

"How should one cope with emotional and psychological abuse? How can I deal with this endless cycle that is constantly keeping me anxious and afraid of anyone, I feel like a living corpse because I can't express my negative emotions to my abusers and am a constant victim, what should I do?",1,mko8pi,4,"&#x200B;

Usually abuse is looked over when it is not physical. I sometimes wish my abusers could break my legs so I could be taken seriously. What messed up my mind was none of the insults I was called and it was not none of the slaps, punches and kicks I took. It was the threats,ignoring,glares,fits of rage, gaslighiting, isolating me. How can I ...cope with the past and deal better with emotional abuse in the future. I feel constant anxiety, as if it would happen again, for whatever reason people always choose me as a victim/scapegoat for their anger and scream at me, project hteir insecurities onto me. I don't know what am I doing, and what behavior is attracting these kinds of individuals, I sometimes feel liek I have to set strong walls around me and not let anyone in since even small empathy attracts bullies

I have physical symptoms due to repressed anger and bullying in school, I went to all doctors and they told me I am healthy, so it was psychological. I want to take off my anger on people who deserve it, those who abuse me, not take it on people who don't deserve it-my parents, hearing me scream. I am usually really quiet, overly polite and nice person but I have never been respected. It is is like two people exist in this world - moronic dumb agressive people who teach you to fear them, and nice people whom no one respects for no reason, despite them being agreeable and doing everything, no one respects them, which is weird. The so called assertive people seem to be really rare. I want to become assertive because I can't really be agressive, I am so emotionally raped that I can't even scream anymore. I just, I just want bad people to leave me alone and people to respect me. I literally don't know what am I doing wrong with my behavior, is my body language bad, is it my empathy, is it my overniceness? I read many articles on why people attract bullies and they all give different reasons. I feel hopeless and don't know what to say anymore.

I don't know what is true and what is false, it seems like bullies only respect those dumb kinds of people that are agressive like them - i think people think they may have confidence and stand up for them selves due to the pure agression when in reality they are just assholes. Mature people are quiet and kind but people think I am weak. I want to stop being vulnerable, but as long as I am human, I will be vulnerable, however I want to change my self in a way that will say - hey, she isn't inferior, so I won't bully her. For whatever reason people just decide to bully me. I always blamed my lack of friends and mental illness that causes me to be overly emotional over little things, which I still am, I can't correct this trait, so I really try to not be reactive...the problem is that in school usually the bullies forced me into a corner until I couldn't help but react, so whether I reacted or not, I was bullied anyway. I don't understand how people once decide they hate me and then literally judge everything I do. - I remember being bullied for drinking water and literally breathing once in 10th grade, I don't know why someone could be so petty.

TLTR: How can I stop the cycle of bullying and become like one of those people that are usually not very smart but are brave and can stand up for them selves and command respect. Please don't tell me - BUT YOU EARN RESPECT- becuase you don't earn it. No one earns it. From my experience, only the more dumb and agressive people who fought were respected and nice people like me were just bullied. I would like to become more proactive, responsive and less reactive and emotional, how can I control my anxiety. I sometimes feel like I am doomed to constantly be bullied, since it is an endless cycle, everywhere I goes, there is always this group of assholes that size me up as a girl, and since I am not naturally sassy and outspoken and am quiet, they take it as having no confidence."

Depression effecting work performance,4,mko206,0,"I have never been so depressed my work has been effected before. I always got glowing compliments for my job performance once I found a field that was right for me. But now when I have the slightest amount of free time at work. Which unfortunately I have a lot of, compared to my old job I can't go back to, I go stire crazy. Things that seemed fun before just seem like too much effort now a lot of the time. And I never feel like I have enough time to enjoy myself either even though I have a lot of free time. I waste it steering off into space now, missing my old job when I was always busy and missing having my own place. I so fricken unhappy, and the worst part is I know what would make me happy but I can't have that. I basically have to live with my boyfriend until we move. Him and his roommates. But I think I'm so use to living on my own that being around 2 other guys that consently want to joke about how fat you are gets on my nerves. I have no idea what to do. I really love my boyfriend but he doesn't want to get our own place and while he said I could have my own place if we don't end up moving out of the country that's a long way off. I'd like to be happy where I am now but the consent stream of you look like a man or your fat jokes from his friends is so tiring and they aren't you he kind of people that respect when you aren't in the mood for that.

Advice i received from a therapist,4,mko090,2," 

Hello all. I hope all of you have been doing what you can to tackle your emotions. So recently I decided to bring back my dream of becoming a psychotherapist myself a few months back after withdrawing from my previous uni programs. I emailed my relative's therapist friend and after a few questions about my future career i asked him how one can deal with negative emotions like grief from a breakup or loss of a loved one. One good point he mentioned is that people underestimate the importance of grief. He said that people try to focus too much on moving on with little realization of the benefits hardships have to offer. No matter how big it may be, one needs to embrace and become one with his emotions. One needs to see emotions of hardship as an opportunity to evolve. He also said that a kind-hearted person like me, should I ever encounter a devastating situation, is to place a huge focus on helping others in need, such as helping the homeless or supporting those with addictions. He said that the potential reason why people still struggle on moving forward is because they focus too much on themselves during stages of grief. People, especially those with the kindest hearts, should place a certain focus on helping others in need. Sometimes, trying to please or improve ourselves only is not enough. We should place effort into pleasing our friends, family, and even strangers. This can even be simple stuff like baking a pie for the whole family, buying your dog something nice like doggy clothes, etc. Practice gratitude towards others. Give change to the homeless, try babysitting,etc. Not only recieving gratitude from others help us, but we also grow as people. Perhaps consider taking a flight to a developing nation and try your best to assist those people there!

I did a thing,1,mknynm,0,"Edit-I broke my toe being discharged out of anger now I have emotional, psychological and physical pain lol

The lady on the  phone told me i wasn't going to recieve help the police officers and ambulance crew insisted I would. The nurse said I'd be kept in overnight and she didn't feel safe sending me home, another nursed asked where my pain was.... I replied in my head. I wasn't offered any solutions. The psych Dr told me he didn't think I was depressed. I replied because I have bpd. He didn't offer me anything but a pamphlet for home treatment which since my multiple recorded comments about suicide haven't made any contact with me. They don't care. They don't think I'm a risk. Maybe they don't know me at all. Maybe it's me who has it all wrong parhaps my over welling sadness and feeling of being constantly tortured in the living life are false. Maybe in my better judgement this wouldn't be considered depression but escapism to some place else. Maybe im not scared of being in the light but instead I'm excited about producing in the dark......."
Am I the only one who feels more depressed on days with nice weather?,20,mknub9,5,"On days where the suns shining and it’s nice out, I just feel more depressed because I feel like I should be doing something productive outside. Thing is 99% of the time I don’t have the energy, or motivation to do more than I have to. That’s why I like cloudy, rainy days because I know everyone else is being lazy too. Maybe I’m just weird."
how to end,1,mknp4c,0,"what are the easiest and most effective ways?
Hang my neck? But i dont have any rope. Gun to my head? But i dont have guns bc im a minor. Starvation? my family is force feeding me the meals. Falling from a building? How many feet should the building be? Slit my wrists? But its super painful. Please suggest some methods guys. Thank you"

Failed my attempt this weekend,3,mknkhm,2,"I was under too much to process. I ended up taking my entire bottle of antidepressants. I was found by my friends and taken to ER. I had the worse experience in ER. Wasn’t allowed to eat or drink anything. I kept begging for a sip of water but none. Now it’s been over 24 hours since I am discharged and I am unable to eat or drink.
I feel loner than ever before. I just don’t want to feel like this. I feel like I will puke if I eat or drink anything. It’s more than 72hours since I had anything. Is this normal?"
Mentality,1,mknii5,0,"Once you develop the mentality that, everything in life is shit, every small and big detail, that nothing at all is good, not ANYTHING,  and the, you don't deserve happiness, that you deserve everything bad that comes your way, that you deserve to suffer, that this pain is something you should already make a home for in your head, it doesn't matter if there is no space for it there, you kick every last bit of hope or good in your mind, and you make that home for the pain cuz that's all you will get and that's all you deserve. Just start living hand in hand with the pain. Once you develop that mentality, then you can maybe live a little longer."

Everyday I just struggle to stay alive,2,mknet1,0,"If depression isn't bad enough I swear I get the most insane intrusive thoughts/some ocd and no therapist/conselllur been able to help. If depression isn't bad enough I look like im from 8-12 despite having lifted weights for years so no one finds me attractive. My social anxiety is so extreme. I feel beyond cursed, possessed. Deep down I've just felt like a higher power exists and just loves to fuck with me. People act like im delusional but I just say try living in my shoes. What if im actually right , and you're wrong ? Even if no higher power exists i still feel that way strongly. Ill be alone forever also , it isn't worth going to a hooker as they don't care about ya. I suck at everything in life no matter how much I've tried. People tell me to do shit but I don't wanna do anything. Pyschedelics did permanent damage too. Mental illness did permanent damage. I'm just tired of it. If suicide didn't hurt others I truly would brutally kill myself by now I think. I have no hope for the future im truly in hell of my own mind. I cringe making this post its not gonna help jack shit aside from someone tryna fix me like usual lol"
Scared about what other people might think when I die,1,mkncl3,1,"I care about what other might say about me even up to this day.

How to encourage a friend to open up when she’s withdrawing for over a week ?,1,mknaf8,0,She pushes me away
Feeling like a loser,1,mkn8k2,4,"So I want to be successful so bad! I just got 2 jobs, but now I don’t have the energy at all to keep both. They give me bad anxiety and it’s just feeling like torture going. I’m not mentally strong enough to go and I feel like shit. Is there something wrong with me? I have major depression and it consumes my body and mind 24/7 and it’s just so hard to fight all the time. Plus my anxiety and dissociation is so bad too...I just feel like a wreck."
How do you handle lapses? How do you own up or avoid them?,1,mkn57a,0,"I'm in the sixth week of my first full-time work and unfortunately, I've also just restarted my medication after three weeks of running out. 

My immediate superior has been concerned since the second or third week of my job because I've had lapses: failing to log-in or out and submit my End-of-Day reports, failing to perform small daily tasks, sending in task submissions late, and at times not sending them at all.

My superior has been one of the most patient bosses I've ever had (only five, really). He started meeting with me weekly since my third week to plan out my daily tasks. When my personal laptop broke down, he got me a work laptop in just a couple of days.

On my fifth week, I started really breaking down (the second week since I ran out of meds). He met me online and asked why I was underperforming. At this point I finally opened up about how badly my depression was affecting my performance (I informed them about it during my application), and we set about making my tasks more manageable. He also talked to management about enrolling me in their HMO (which I'm actually not entitled to yet because I'm still a probationary hire). He also reached out to his own friend to get me a prescription in the meantime because I can't afford a psychiatrist appointment. Then he told me to rest for the week because we had a long weekend from holidays anyway.

Today was my first day back after that break. We set expectations again, and I was supposed to handle one of my regular tasks (updating and adding shared content to our social media accounts) alongside one deliverable per day. Unfortunately, I lost track of time and failed to deliver again. He's told me about it and said that while he understood my situation, I have to respect our agreement and not disrespect him. 

I understand. They hired me because they're severely understaffed, and without me, the work would just be taken by my immediate superior. He's also gone out of his way to provide support even though I'm just a new hire.

So the questions are: how do you handle lapses? How do you move forward if they happen? How do you make up for them? How do you avoid them? How do you keep track, and remain consistent? How do you pick yourself up after a stumble (understatement, really)?"
"Depression, music, & more.",7,mkmzu8,8,"Hey everyone. My name is Justin Yates. I suffer from hyperactive adhd, “extreme” depression, and more. Music has always been my therapy. I tend to use it to get these demons out. Any other musicians in here who use music as a tool to help with depression?"
My current depression struggles,3,mkmr9f,0,"It's hard, getting up every morning. I no longer look forward to the day, but with my particular depression often it feels worse if I lay around too much because of having existential OCD, I have to find something to distract myself.

So I get up, usually around 10am, force myself to shower, brush my teeth, make breakfast. For me that part is not the hardest part, the hardest part is staying sane the rest of the day.

Having obligations but having zero motivation to get through them. Trying to make it through a homework assignments (I'm doing a Master's degree) but I have no drive or sense of urgency to get it done. That and the depression has slowed down my thinking abilities by like 70%, I simply can't focus like I used to and ideas just don't flow. It now takes a lot to get the gears grinding.

The worst part of the depression is feeling no connection to myself. Like the inside of me is like a big void. Even when people are jerk holes to me I have no reaction. It was only last semester that I felt on top of the world, I was passionate and striving to make a change in the world, but things changed so quickly over winter break. I myself am still trying to make sense of how my depression got so bad so quick. I used to wake up early in the morning 6am, I would work on projects, do homework, I was a super motivated individual. Where things took a wrong turn was I eventually became burn out near the end of last semester, maybe I over did it. Then the burn out lead to depression, then it became existential, negative thoughts piling one after another. As time went on it just got worse, feeling less and less like myself. Many times my existential thoughts have made me feel like I'm going crazy, this is why I need to distract myself all the time. For now it helps, but it's not where I want to be.

My depression tells me I am stuck like this, but I am fighting and holding on to the hope that one day I'll make it back to the other side."
"Depression Memory Loss, Other Memory Loss, or Just Bad Brain?",2,mkmprz,3,"Hi yall, I'm starting to get very concerned about my lack of ability to remember things, and I wanted to get thoughts on it. Has anyone has experienced similar? If so,  was it depression related or related to something else? I often have trouble remembering things (if I've told a story before, new peoples' names), but its becoming more and more concerning.

I've always had problems remembering names, but at this point its ridiculous. My mom has a biiiig family, and I only see them a max of three times a year, but I should remember their names by now. I forgot my cousin's name, her husband's name, and their second kid's name. I'm incredibly upset by this. There's another two cousins whose names I rarely remember.

I remember certain details of events, but not others. A couple years back I went to a baseball game during a trip with my parents, but I can't remember who else we went with, what city we were in, or why else we were there. But I can vaguely remember the route we took to get back to the bus, where we stopped for snacks, and the drive back to where we were staying.

Stuff like this happens all the time. Could this be a depression thing? Or should I get checked for something else?"
Depression and brain fog,9,mkmhow,1,"For a long time, I have fought against this persistent feeling that I wasn't real and lived in thick, deep fog. I felt like my memory was not as good as it should be, and my ability to function in life was deeply affected.

Yes, I am able to function on an average level. I was able to get my master's degree and am doing ""ok"". But the entire time I did it, it has been a struggle. 


One time I **lost** my car in a small city because I forgot where I parked. I had to walk and weave between blocks to find my vehicle because I had no fucking idea. I had devised a system to know where I parked, by screenshotting my location on Google Maps. At the time though, my GPS was off, and I screenshotted the wrong location. Oops. This is no longer a problem though because I moved. 


I have labels in my room on shelves that say ""deoderant"", ""glasses"", ""wallet"" like someone with significant impairment. I have a label on my one of my plant's which tells me the maximum volume I can turn up my Amazon Alexa and not bother my roommates. It's volume number 3 by the way, lol. That really did help. 


I forget that I tell stories and my ex didn't tell me. I kind of resent him for not being honest with me about it, but now I am more concious about it. I forget details about people that are important, but I am much better at it now. I actually became a couple and family therapist, so my memory has been forced to improve in that area. 


In my deepest times, I will forget to eat, shower, brush my teeth. It's not that I don't want to do them, it's that I don't even think of it. It doesn't even register that these things are important. Then when I come out of this fog, I am horrified at the things I have been neglecting and need to recover. Then by the time I recover, I fall back in.

This pandemic has saved my life because I have been able to work on myself and my needs. I was able to do transcranial magnetic stimulation and it changed everything for me. Absolutely everything.  But I wanted to share my story with brain fog and let you know you're not alone with it. This shit sucks, and it's something I just try to cope with. There are a lot of strategies for it, it just takes some time and experimenting with solutions.

Apologize for the wall of text. 


TLDR: Brain fog can impair your life significantly, but there are strategies you can do to overcome it. Think of it like a puzzle or game to solve and you can do it. Do it without shame, it's your house and fuck others who judge."
"i’m going to be completely frank, i probably won’t make it to the end of the year",12,mkmfcs,9,"i’ve tried everything, therapy doesn’t work, talking to friends and family doesn’t help, the harmful stuff (which i won’t get into) makes me feel worse in the long run. i just feel so lost. but i don’t want to commit suicide, i just don’t want to be alive anymore."
What to say to someone who's depressed,2,mkme3v,24,"Hey all, so one of my friends is sometimes depressed and I thought it would be nice to send them messages twice a day ish just generally wishing them good health or asking them how their day has been.

I asked them if it would be something they'd like (I'm not going to start doing it out of the blue) and they liked the idea. So what kind of things should I say? Or does it not really matter too much?

Thanks in advance to anyone who replies. And sorry if this is against the rules in anyway, I've read them but don't usually post here."

they speak of half-truths and grandiose lies,

whilst in the opaque darkness my heart dies

cool metal kissing life itself goodbye.

Enticing joy in its nitroglycerine tip

One swift iron bird to this damned head flies;

Am I wrong for hating my family. They aren't the worst but I just ... can't stand them. Do I even hate them? Or what. What's wrong with me,1,mklwyn,1,"I can't tell if my family is bad. Am I wrong to feel like this?????? Gosh. But I hate this fucking place. I hate that I'm born here. And I hate that I'm me.


My parents aren't the worst but they aren't the best. It's because of them I hate myself though. And they're pretty close minded. I won't go in depth with my dad since he's not around anymore, but I'm pretty sure he's worse than my mum anyway. My mum really thinks just because it's someone is gay less than a normal human. 


I can tell my mum tries her best but I still can't fucking stand her. I wanna cut ties from everything that has to do with now. I need to leave....... I'm only 20. So it's hard. I know in other countries people are independent at 18 but it's different here. Even at 21 a lot of people here are still dependent on their parents.


I feel bad and ungrateful but I can't fucking stand all of this. I hate them. And you know what. They can hate me too. I don't even care if I die so why would I care about anything else"
Are you meant to feel happy when the depression is over?,1,mklve7,0,"I first realised I was depressed 10 years ago and tbh life wasn't great before then either, but I felt happy for the first time in 5 years about halfway through 2016, probably because I was out of school for the summer and was able to give myself time to mend. But then life started again and I went back to feeling hollow. 

I'm working now and since 2016 I've had a few minor depressive relapses, but apart from that I just have a nagging feeling of hopelessness for the future and I don't know if I'd call it depression or not, but it's not like I'm thinking of ways to kill myself every day or anything.

If you told me I had a terminal illness I think I'd be a bit relieved, but I feel like it's more because the world sucks than because of depression.

Basically what I'm asking is does it sound like I'm still depressed, or am I just jaded and miserable because who the hell wouldn't be in 2021?

I can still have fun with things I used to enjoy doing, like marathoning TV shows and playing video games (I'm actually pretty excited for a few upcoming releases), but every day still feels like a pointless waste of time.

Am I supposed to be happy? Is anyone?"
Do you think that mental health problems should be considered disabling diseases?,4,mkltuw,4,I think yes and I'm including also depression and anxiety.
"Everybody who is depressed (in my life), is functioning or has got better and I feel stuck and left behind.",3,mklpa7,2,"I have a friend with depression (she calls it depression, I dont wanna invalidate her but she isnt diagnosed). She studies (a lot), prepares in advance for exams and stuff, has a lot of self-confidence, is functioning well, likes the way she looks, dresses up and takes pics, travels and goes to restaurants and she is ""depressed"".


I have another friend (and I thought she was the only one who could understand me) who went through soemthing (idk what) and was suicidal and depressed, but her depression iss no longer there, (went away within a month). I opened up to her about my struggle with low functioning depression and my diagnosis of severe MDD and she said nothing. She said she was doing great herself and shut off the conversation.

These people who supposedly have depression, have experiences so far away from mine and I feel misunderstood.

I tell the first one about how hard it is to get out of bed and how my muscles have no strength on the worst days, and she doesnt understand. Uhhhh..... always so alone, no one ever shares the same experinces as me.

Forgive my spelling errors I dont care enough to correct them"
I want to end the pain and suffering.,1,mklodm,12,"I can’t anymore. This whole world is bad and I can’t live hear anymore. No one cares about me. The fact I’m a guy and guys have made a bad reputation, I hate it. I’m to soft and let everyone walk all over me. I literally quit everything I do but I even start it so what’s the points I ain’t got no future, everyone doing there own thing and I just being a lazy. It’s just me. I don’t wanna live a life with this illness anymore, I don’t wanna live a life where I don’t and can’t let people know my thought and opinion. Last night I was going to take some pills. I didn’t but I might do tonight."

"Im 19, balding and I hate it",12,mkll9z,5,"I'm a 19 year old Psychology student (the irony) and I'm severely balding. I always get weird looks wherever I go especially in our university, I exist in a society where your hair is something that ""completes your look"" and having a balding head among an ocean of clean fades and trendy haircuts sticks out like a sore thumb, I hate how people looked at me different but I can't blame them, I also hate how some of them felt the need to point out my head when I was the one who notices it the most, every gust of wind that might show my scalp, trying not to sweat in a tropical climate and wearing a cap wherever I go. We've been having online classes since the pandemic began and it has given me the chance to see what I look like shaven and I absolutely hate it, the only thing that I've got going for me is my physique, I'm short and could not grow a beard to save my life, I have a weak jawline and my head shape is whack. Heck, even some of my closest friends couldn't help but laugh when I facetimed them. The pandemic is finally getting better thanks to vaccines (which I'm glad about) but I don't know how I'm gonna be able to face my classmates and professors when our university finally opens up again. I don't want to be looked at with disgust and I don't want anyone to see me with my girlfriend because it may be a bad look for her. this sucks.

I am so so sorry for venting here but this is something that I could not say to anyone else. My family is composed of doctors who are busy fighting Covid right now and I wouldn't want to bug them and I'm afraid that most of my closest friends wouldn't understand, I posted this here in hopes of finding someone who has gone through something like this and I would really like to know how you managed to do it. Again, I'm so sorry for venting here but I felt that I needed this, thank you."
How do deal with being in a relationship with someone who has depression?,2,mkliye,1,"So my wife has always suffered from depression/anxiety, I try to be empathetic and I've had my spouts of depression in my life so I get the feeling like you have no control over it. But I think me catering to her has made it worse over the years. We have three kids, I'm self employed and mostly work from home, and days when she's in bed all day I just take care of everything. So by me 'taking care of everything' she really has little responsibilities which over time makes her feel like she isn't needed and makes her depression worse because we are all continuing through life without her and she feels like there's no place for her. But she kinda did that by forcing me and the kids to live day to day without her.

And then on top of that, the last couple years it's been getting worse. Sometimes she'll spend 2,3,4 days in bed which fuels the above and makes us all even more independent from her.

Now I don't want to be upset and angry with her about it, I understand it's a disease and that we have circumstances that are also effecting it (lockdown, most of our family/friends have moved away, etc) so a lot of times I get through it by thinking to myself that if she wasn't here and I was a single father I would be doing everything anyway and wouldn't be complaining or be upset. So in my head I just think that, which just distances us further because I'm always just going about my life as if she isn't in it.

Not sure what to do at this point. If I talk to her about it then it'll just make her more depressed. And because there's not really a 'solution' it's like whats the point in addressing it.

Any advice or resources you could point me to?"
Scared of overdose during an episode??,3,mklefz,3,I had an episode and took 100mg of citalopram. What do I do? I don’t want to go to the hospital and don’t want to tell family cause I’m scared they’ll be disappointed. Can I wait this out and not tell anyone?
Happiest time comes after depression,4,mklcfh,0,"A few months ago I spent every single day on this sub, was diagnosed with severe depression, didn’t have a job, basically never left my bed and cried every day. I didn’t really know what was going on but it felt like the living devil was inside of my body. I shouted and prayed for it to be over. I thought I’d never make it out of there. 

I see a lot of people on here having exactly the same destructive feelings. Let me tell you why you need to be patient. 

After going through literal emotional hell I feel like new born. After months of feeling unmotivated and drained I see everything in color, everything is interesting again. I can finally see beauty in so many things I never saw before. I’m so thankful to be living on the most fascinating rock in the universe. I feel like I can do it. I have new dreams and everything I felt like giving up on now feels like as if I can do it if I just keep working on it. My most important takeaway from this horrible time is the fact that I actively wanted to kill myself. You might wonder as to how that can be a positive takeaway, but it’s simple: What am I afraid of if it’s not death? Exactly, nothing. So that means I can live fearlessly. I’ll give all I’ve got to achieve my dreams. There’s nothing to lose if you’re not afraid of death.

I still have days where the bad inner voice returns. I try to not listen and do things that distract me. Life is not easy. But surviving depression can make it a bit more beautiful in hindsight."

1.5 year later, he is outside from his NEW house and he returns home to get water bottles in order to dispose them outside. When he arrives to the house, he notices more trash and decides to clean it. He rushly picks trash items and throws them into the trash bags. The first item that he randomly picked and put into the trash bag, was a napkin but he did not fully realise it. He then continued rushly picking and putting other trash items to the bag. He left his house with the trash bag full of trash and disposed it outside.

Did he lose the bet?

1) He did not lose the bet. The bet was that he wont return home to get paper napkins. Which means that there are some specific actions and 1 specific intention that start from outside of his house. He returned for the bottles (different intention). After entering the house, he noticed more trash and decided to pick every trash and put it into the bag (new circumstance). He picked napkins along with other trash and put them into the trash bag. Picking items from his whole house may count as cleaning so its a new event. Napkins were put into the bag with other trash, so they became trash. He left his house with the trash bag. If someone asks him what did he do? He would say that he returned for the bottles BUT decided to clean his whole house (new event) by putting trash into the bag along with the bottles.Bet not lost.

2) He lost the bet. The man returned for the bottles but decided to pick more trash items. Since he was planning to take trash items by putting them into the bag, with the intention to get them out in order to dispose them, he had the chance to pick everything except napkins. By deciding to pick the napkins and put them along with the bottles in which he returned for, maybe it counted as if he returned to get the bottles and also the napkins. Even though they were trash, he had the option which trash to choose to take out. Since he returned for the bottles and then, decided to take napkins, it maybe counted as if he returned to get bottles AND napkins. Bet is lost.

What do you think and why?"
*ADHD issues & Major Depression MEDICATION Q*,1,mkkh5u,2,"I’ve been unofficially diagnosed with ADHD as a 24(F). I say unofficial because I can’t currently afford the 1,000 test to make it official but my therapist (who specializes in ADHD) and I both agree. I also have major depressive disorder but my therapist can’t tell which is worse as they are both so intertwined. I started Wellbutrin and had a rare side effect of myalgia and muscle/bone pain after only 3 days of medication so I was forced to stop. My doctor is giving me a week to settle before prescribing the next attempt and is allowing me to look into what I think is best and he will prescribe whatever it is. He thinks we should focus on the depressive symptoms first and see if that helps before moving into any stimulants (as he fears they may increase anxiety symptoms and i guess because my diagnosis is ‘unofficial’. Basically i’m asking if anyone has experienced anything similar and has any recommendations of medication that worked for them? I was bummed about Wellbutrin because I really thought it would be the miracle drug for me. :/"
Bad experience with edibles?,1,mkkbyk,2,"So this was last night... I took a shot of alcohol at like 7pm, I'm not light weight or anything but I decided to only do one, and I took the edible around 1130. It didn't really hit until like 1230 to 1. My friend said it was 10mg and I've never smoked before and it was my first time trying edibles too. The feeling kind if sucked? It was like I was too tired to focus on how I felt but I got shakes?? Every 5 to 10 seconds felt like I was in a dream and I was aware of it but in the dream I was falling and if you know the jolt your body gets right before you hit the ground and you wake up THAT'S what it felt like.. that constant jolt. Anyway I slept at 330 and woke up at 7 and my stomach feels awful. Idk if it's the mix with the shot and the weed? Or if maybe it's just the edible? Just wondering if a stomach ache or shakes are normal for a first timer lol"
depression sucks,4,mkk5uu,3,"I don’t know how long I can take it here anymore. Im really trying so hard to stay alive but its just so freaking hard. I just don’t feel like myself anymore and my depression is getting worse and worse. My parents are apart of a religious cult “Jehovah’s witnesses) and they are going to cut me off next year when i turn 18 and leave the religion so i will have no family and they are also homophobic and wouldn’t support me if i came out as bi to them. Im not doing well in school, im failing all my classes and their taking about putting me in to in person school instead of virtual and i don’t know how much my anxiety can take."
I feel weak,6,mkk44z,3,"I feel physically and emotionally weak. I haven't been getting enough nutrition and water. I'm addicted to sweets, which is difficult to stop because it relieves stress. Often, I skip dinner and go straight to bed after getting off work."
Idk,6,mkjuwy,4,I’m just a disappointment and I deserve to die. I honestly really want to die. I’m just going to constantly be a bother to others. Just constantly disappoint everyone and just constantly be depressed. I think I just should disappear it would be better for everyone.

THIS. It never really goes away... I'm beyond exhausted and lonely. The people around me can't understand how much I struggle and I don't blame them. And I hate myself for being so powerless and helpless to just end things.,1,mkjp8b,0,"""Then there is this: In some way, the quiet terror of severe depression never entirely passes once you’ve experienced it. It hovers behind the scenes, placated temporarily by medication and renewed energy, waiting to slither back in, unnoticed by others. It sits in the space behind your eyes, making its presence felt even in those moments when other, lighter matters are at the forefront of your mind. It tugs at you, keeping you from ever being fully at ease. Worst of all, it honors no season and respects no calendar; it arrives precisely when it feels like it."" - Daphne Merkin, A Journey Through Darkness"
Not feeling very good,3,mkjnwb,4,I have been feeling really down the past 2 days and I don't know when I will feel better. I don't want my friend to worry but I don't want to burden him. We live in different countries. Should I text him to tell him I might not be in contact with him for a while?
Can anyone offer me some pep talk?,3,mkjnlu,7,"I have not taken a bath in days. I spend more than half my day sleeping or lying in bed listening to sad songs. I eat a lot of processed foods. I keep drinking my sadness away. My homeworks are piling up I'm afraid I can't make excuses anymore.

How can I care about my meaningless job when we’re all in a crisis?,11,mkjgjw,1,"I have been having the worst pandemic fatigue and depression the past few weeks, feeling even worse than I did at the very first week of the pandemic. Our city has been the longest locked down in all of North America with it being extended now another month, and likely extended again after that. I’m so done with this, I see the same people week by week. Yesterday I sat on my couch staring at the ceiling because there’s nothing to do and I’m too afraid to see anyone since the news coverage is ramping up and there’s constantly articles about younger people dying or that we’re running out of ventilators. I really can’t take it anymore. 

To top it all off I work in advertising where it’s literally as if covid doesn’t exist to these people. They regularly ask people to work weekends and we can absolutely never catch a break. If you ever even admitted to needing a mental health day you’d likely be on a list of people for the next lay off. Our city keeps going into lockdown and they rarely say anything about it or check in on people. I just never thought I’d see a life where someone’s thirty second commercial was more important than my life. I put so much of myself into my work and I feel like it’s never enough. I’m always being asked to take on more from other people (they say it’s because I’m so good at my job.....) and no raises because of the pandemic of course. 

I don’t know how to get out of this cycle. I can’t quit because I absolutely need the money. I’ve interviewed for other jobs as well but I never get them, I think I’m having a hard time interviewing on zoom. I used to be able to nail interviews and always get the job and now it’s always a no."

I want everything to end,16,mkj6qf,3, I turn 34 in 2 months. I'm sick of living I have been treating depression since I was 18 years old. I'm fed up. I have lost the best years of my life. Now I see how everyone forms a family. I am still sunk in grief. Struggling with depression and anxiety. During all these years I have lived as I have been able to continue day by day. And I'm still fucked up and alone. I want everything to end
I’m so tired of my depression making me feel physically sick,3,mkj1h1,2,"I struggle with both anxiety and depression and was diagnosed a few years ago. I’m sure many of you can relate to how the pandemic has made my mental health much worse, but now I’m not only dealing with the crap in my head but also feeling sick almost 24/7. I regularly vomit and have nausea as well as an upset stomach, and my diet hasn’t changed so I know it’s not that. 

Before I started getting these more intense physical symptoms it was (slightly) easier to get on with my day - everything was just thoughts and not really physical unless I was anxious. But now I can’t do anything because it’s both my mind AND body now. I’ve called into work several times because I’ve been so depressed & anxious that I felt like I had a hangover and couldn’t stop puking. 

I’m not sure if this is normal, but if anyone has tips on how to feel physically better I would greatly appreciate it"
Doing nothing is scary,2,mkiy73,1,"So I’m an alcoholic, I drunk to treat my depression and anxiety. I stopped drinking six years ago, because I had so severe withdrawal symptoms, I had to be in the hospital for a week. After it, I started my own business and started PhD in history. Nearly all my depression and anxiety connected symptoms are gone. My last six years was very busy, I had a lot to do every day. On Friday I started to feel strange, it’s probably COVID but I will be tested only tomorrow. So I’m at home alone since Friday and my only task to do is to recover. It means lying on my bed and watching TV, because I feel pretty bad and I don’t even have energy to read a book or anything else. Yesterday my depression symptoms appeared, I feel useless, I’m ultrasensitive again.  The weather is beautiful, but I feel I just wasting my time lying here and I’m just cause problems for my family. I just realised that maybe the only reason that most of my depression and anxiety symptoms are gone in the last years is because I had a lots of work and I was always too busy to care about it."
Losing someone to suicide,2,mkiwfr,1,"If suicide is something that can be triggering to you, this may not be the best post for you to read. Same If death in general can be triggering.

I guess this is me ranting. 
If this post goes against community guidelines, feel free to take it down.
I just feel so empty. The fact that I will never see her face again is still unreal to me. Just three days ago she was here with us and now she’s suddenly gone? 
She was so helpful, a great person and helped me feel less alone.
I still don’t know why. What was so painful she had no other way out? I don’t think anyone knows. 
That is what’s the most scary to me about all this. The uncertainty. 
I haven’t been able to do anything for days. Just watching a simple video becomes exhausting.
Existence is exhausting right now."
I’ve been stagnant for 3 years and I don’t know what to do anymore,57,mkij4m,12,"I wake up every morning with dread and spend the day stuck in my head. I haven’t worked and when I do I barely manage to scrape by before leaving or let go. Everyone else has progressed since graduation and I can’t seem to get out of my head. I had expectations for the last years of my youth and they were all spent miserably, unfulfilled, eventless, and scared. I feel so alone and scared all the time. I think this is more anxiety than depression. Please send some words I just want to live again and I’m running out of time."
"Guilt, fear and depression",2,mkihpl,0,"I've been going through an intense period of guilt and shame. Shame for who I used to be, for things I've done and mistakes (not all I could help or prevent) I've made. I feel guilt for hurt I might have caused, for damage I might have inflicted and for what I now see as lapses in judgement. I'm unsure if I remember these things correctly, as they caused little to no depression or hurt at the time, but now they loop through my head with painful regularity. It's starting to impact my ability to function. I stare back at the recklessness with which I lived my early 20s and shudder with both shame and regret. I also feel that people will remember or find out about these instances, and my life and relationships will fall apart. Most of these things happened 6-8 years ago.

Many people see my as a good person, but in the regard I feel I'm a fraud. For reference I'm diagnosed as a depressive and take medications.

I'm looking for tips to overcome this phase of crippling, obsessive rumination. Anybody been hit by something similar and managed to beat it?"
Let’s play the wheel of depression!,6,mkigku,1,"Not sure how to engage with the depressed people in your life? Are they failing to respond to the wisdom and undeniable soundness and feasibility of your advice to just ""get over it""?
It's time to play....Wheel...of....Depression!!!! Simply write each of the words on the Wheel of Fortune wheel and give it a good ol' spineroo. Insert the word you land on into the following phrase: ""Oh, come one now! You're not 'depressed', you're just being ______."" and say it to the depressed person who is inconveniencing you with their CRIPPLING ILLNESS- selfish whining and moping all the time. Alright, let's spin!
*Stupid *Anti-social *Over-sensitive *Critical *An attention whore *Boring *Dramatic *Pre-menstrual *Self-centered *Weird *Young *Delusional *Crazy *Whiny *Bratty *Trendy *Lonely *Emotional *Short-sighted *Irrational *A party pooper *Self-defeating *Unrealistic *Stubborn
Extra points for a dismissive hand wave, air quotes around the word ""depressed"", finger-pointing, or the classic ""Sorry I'm not sorry for telling it like it is"" shoulder shrug. All the points for you and your bold statement of unfiltered truth, you edgy and unique fucking unicorn! Because negative, diminutive accusations are exactly what that person needs to hear right now. How do you win? Eh, really the depressed person just loses.
(from a comment i found in here)"
"How am i supposed to stay alive when everyone else is so happy and no one understands me, i am not asking this to sound edgy, people genuinely misunderstand me and my good intentions and dislike me for no reason when i try my best",16,mki9fk,1,"""A lot of people haven't experienced this level of bullying and abuse, and it seems absurd to them. Happy, ignorant bastards."" 

This is correct but makes me want to self harm. I just want to move on from this chapter in my life, i am tired of living in the past and being a burden to everyone. I just want to be happy. I think i deserve it for being constantly blamed for everything in my life and being neglected and abused and harassed. How can I live on, i feel like i have to live with this pain"
"Last year I lost my father, my grandparents. I still am struggling to recover and it's getting worse.",4,mki8vk,2,"There's still some really rough nights. I've always struggled to connect with people but now I feel like it's gotten more difficult. I worry I'm just an awful person. My father possibly died from covid and I would have been the only person to give it to him at the time. I can't help but think the last time I hugged him was when I broke down crying about having tried to kill myself and he admitted to trying the same years ago. It's taken so long to open up after other past trauma and just like my mother, he's gone before I could show him I've been trying. 
  
So I'm at a place now where it just seems like no one wants to connect with each other or we're all stressed out by it. Even my therapist had given up on me after 2 years of treatment. Nothing has helped. It's hard feel that connection. I'm dropping out of my grad program because I lost my connection to the department. I've not been able to keep up on the work and just find it hard to find that passion anymore. I don't even know what I want to do for work but I know I need to find somewhere to go live and work now. I just want to be left alone but I dread the loneliness. I feel like I haven't gotten anywhere is life for being 30 and still can't manage to hold work or relationships for more than a year.   
  
I partly dream of just giving up everywhere I own to just start walking till I find somewhere new or somewhere to die. I'm kind of good with either, I'm just scared to do anything because I just don't know anymore though."
does it end?,10,mki3s8,3,"this last few weeks have been some of my hardest rock bottoms.
from outside my life should be good.
but the fault lies in my head.
I've starting to realized I was suffering from depression when I was 21, and it took me four years to seriously looking for help.
last year, I also realized that I suffer of anxiety as well.
I've been managing to keep afloat, and honestly, this last 6 month I genuinely though I was going places.
but I can see how is so slipping through my hands now.
again.
I feel so empty, and this last few weeks I feel like I'm drowning. I feel so devoid, and I keep asking myself why?
I really can't see an answer to this, there is no why, no reason.
even if was to find a way to get back up on my feet and be happy, still why?
what am I supposed to do?
just keep working, eating, sleeping, exercising, get dressed every morning, or even dedicate my life to a project or a dream, it surely going to be interesting and excited for a while, but why should I go through all this effort? what for?
I felt so low last week, I gave myself a deadline - if I was getting better, if something would have changed, I should keep going, but if doesn't, then there is no point and I should just end it - and the thing I'm really scared of, is that I will reach the deadline, nothing is changed and still I will be to coward to do it, and I'll be doomed to keep living knowing I wasn't even able to do the only thing that would actually do me any good.
I feel like I'm wasting my life and at the same time I feel that I am so late already and I have hardly any time left.
but even if I do have time left, and I can still do and accomplish things, what's the point in that if I constantly feeling this way? and again, what's the point in general?
I don't even know why I'm really writing here, I know I need help, and I know I can't do this alone, but I also don't hold any real hope that this can get fixed.
this is been for all my life, an endless cycle of moment in which I felt better - and so they gave me the kick to keep going - but then, the true parts are is all the rest, where I'm drowning, and I'm empty, and I'm in pain.
does it ever end?
or is this I just how need to get used to live the rest of my life?"
when did it all even start?,2,mki2y5,2,"I'm 13, I know I'm young. Actually I don't even know when did this all start and how it is happening to me! So basically when I was 6, my mom went abroad to work and I was left with my dad and my grandma. At that time I don't really care about the things around me but when my dad found a job then lost his time with me, I start to feel the lack of attention? I don't, I can't explain it! And for like 4 years I have minimal connection with my mom and even my dad who live in the same house as me don't have time to spend bonding time. I'm just lucky I have my grandma but 'cuz she's getting old, she started to hallucinate, talk in her sleep, speak absolute nonsense, mood swings and even talking to no one (I don't know actually know if it's 'cuz she's getting old or she have mental disorder, we tried to consult to doctors but she hated the thought of a hospital). All I know my grandma is the only person I can lean on. Then 2 more years later, (I'm at first year of high school) like 6 days after my 12th birthday my grandma passed away, the doctors said that the vein in her nape exploded and that she was already brain dead. When she passed away I don't how to react, it took me like 4 months of moving on and emotional supports from my friends. I thought it'll end there but it didn't. Around May 2020 during quarantine, I found out my dad have another woman, I was shocked and I cried once then I'm numb. I don't even know why I didn't told it to my mom, maybe it's my selfless instinct saying ""It's not your business, don't fuck with it! They're all grown they can handle it!"" And it did not end there, July 2020 still in quarantine, my uncle from my mother side invited me to have sex and being me a person who doesn't like the idea said no! Then he like forced me thankfully he's a small person and I'm not successfully ran away from him and shut myself in my room. And that was the very first time I experienced an anxiety attack and I tell you, it's fucking horrible! The same  incident happen again but I got lucky that one of my friend called me so I was able to escape the hell out of there. I know I should've reported it to my parents or to someone but I was so scared that I didn't have the guts to even utter a word. Just thank god he's gone now, and I just wish he'll never go back here and that his entire soul burn to death. I'm still trying to overcome my panic attacks and my depression? I don't know if I'm just stressed or depressed but I'm highly positive to have either both."
1 comforting thought,5,mki0sy,5,"Most things in my life are out of my control because of my depression and anxiety. I panic when i meet new people, I can't handle public places well, anything i do for fun I will doubt I'm good at if I make a single mistake. I don't know if I'll ever get married to an awesome wife and have kids to show all the cool things I know. I don't know if I'll get my dream car, build my dream house or get my dream job. One thing I know for an absolute certainty is that I will choose to kill myself. That is the one power this shit gives me, but that is my choice, for mine to make alone, even if others tell me too, it's not in there hands. Only I can kill myself. And I choose not too. And if I don't get anything I want, I choose to not let it win. I WILL BE THE ONE TO KILL MYSELF, and that will not happen anytime soon. Even though every fiber of my being wants to die, I won't. That is the power this gives me. I will be the one to kill myself. But on my own terms."
Help me I'm depressed,7,mkhxei,5,"Everyday I wake up depressed, force myself out of bed then have a miserable day. I cry myself to sleep every night I've attempted suicide and failed 7 times, I'm in so much pain but I have no one to reach out to. I really need someone to talk to 😔"
I’m trying,9,mkhvl6,1,"I’m literally trying to better my life by applying for me dream job, and my brain has just automatically assumed I’m not getting it, and I have this feeling of absolute dread that will not go away ever. I just want to be not here anymore. I wish I was never born"
so depressed,4,mkhr6b,3,"i just cant take it anymore. im so lonely, and drugs are the only thing that make me happy"
Linear thinking,2,mkhqew,1,"Sometimes, I become aware of the linear thinking of my mind. It's the same feeling as having a lucid dream:
I woke up and the first thing coming to my mind was: ""This is it. This is my life from here to 2 years"". I was picturing myself exactly the same as I feel *now*. 

Generally, that is enough to sink my mood, agreeing to that idea, but today it was just silly. 
Of course that awareness didn't make me feel better, but it let me acknowledge it and let the feeling to fill me up and cry.

Like parenting myself. 

It's kinda funny but makes me wonder if that's good or bad thing.
I feel better now, so I choose to think is a good thing. Lame or not, it is what works for me."
A problem with my mum,1,mkhpjn,0,"Recently I don't really get along with my mum, no like I have ever got along with her, but lately its even worse. She's ignoring me, doesn't speak for all day. I think that she may be depressed, when she went on graveyard, she told me that she's going where she's belongs. I have no idea what I should do, I want make her smile, but I don't know how. I'm really sad and her bad mood affect to me too."
I'm sick of being told I'm negative,7,mkho6j,1,"Of course I'm fucking negative. Life has been shit, 10 years of depression and 3 other mental illness plus autism, getting severely bullied in highschool. Having to drop out of uni twice due to anxiety, the Rona, being an adult virgin with no social skills and hardly any friends
Getting abused by alcoholics at home, of course I'm fucking negative who wouldn't be honestly?"
Life is objectively not worth living,6,mkhfvk,1,"I've struggled with mental illness my whole life basically, having autism really sets you up for a miserable life. The one good thing I always had was family but that's gone to shit too, 2 members of my immediate family are alcoholics and one is abusive. I can't afford to move out because I'm in the last year of my useless degree. I have lost all interest in my hobbies, depression has kicked me to the curb then curb stomped me. I struggle socially due to autism and can't make friends, I basically rot all day in my room, I have been treated like shit my entire life because of it too. Why should I be forced to endure this shit life, because of selfish people who just want me to stay alive so I can suffer? It doesn't get better, I'm sick of hearing that lie repeated ad-nausem. I look at my life objectively and see nothing, I have good friends at the moment thats it, everything else is terrible, there is nothing to look forward to in the future except pain and misery. Death is more humane frankly."
Can someone chat with me and help me to acknowledge what I have been doing it wrong to other people. What is wrong with me? :(,6,mkhe0v,4,"I don’t want to talk to professionals anymore. They’re just giving me prescription drugs to elevate my serotonin level but their only advice to my situation in the community is to distract myself. That’s it. They don’t want to listen how extremely sad and terrified I am to mingle with other people and to go outside from my room. I have been diagnosed with Major Depression from 2 years ago. However, I am doing fine now except to my social life. Whenever I tried to open up about my interest to other people and I told them that I don’t feel anything, they looked at me as if I am a psychopath. Their behavior and treatment towards me have changed. I don’t feel any positive emotions. Not even love nor happiness. I feel nothing. There’s no sparks or butterflies inside my stomach. But I am terrified to get attached with others except my grandmother and my brother. So, what is wrong with me?"
Why is everything so monotone,32,mkhdqb,5,"I feel like a husk of a human being. No drive or desire to do anything in life. I’m lost, nothing is fun, I have no friends irl, I sleep all day and when I’m not I’m sitting in my room doing nothing. Not even video games are fun anymore. Starting to think being alive is pointless I keep wondering what the point of life is. Why live in a planet we are slowly destroying as a being who’s kind is slowly self destructing themselves. I feel guilty though when I think of my situation compared to some others out there. Wish I could give my life to someone who deserves it and actually wants to do something with it."
Vivid nightmares,2,mkhb5m,2,"Just wanted to let it out here.
I had series of terrible dreams where I woke up drenched in sweat, I think I woke up 2-3 times and everytime I went back to sleep it’s another blood, rape, murder - and always family related

And I had another ringing in my left ear when I woke up. Already confused and disoriented, I started to panic thinking my tinnitus might coming back.
Thankfully it was gone when I woke up in the morning but still terrifying experience oh god

 I really don’t know why it’s happened because I didn’t watch or read anything horrific. I was slightly sick though(sinus infection with headache)

I wonder it’s deep seated problem or just random fuckups my brain make

And I’m really depressed today because of this, not to say that this CAUSED my depression but rather brought it up again, can’t stop thinking about it nor get this depressing feeling out of my mind

Thanks for reading..."
What do I do?,1,mkh9j0,1,"My life fell apart after I graduated high school and my parents divorced. Was psychologically addicted to opiates I used to deal with extreme depression and powerful mood swings to the point where I considered suicide but was to afraid to go ahead and do it.

I don't have a job or license because of my own weakness and even dating is out of the question, I can barely function by myself and many people outside of my friends and family would look down on me for being 25 and in the sorry state I am in. I do not want pity, I do not want anything handed to me other than advice. I am a mentally ill borderline autist who suffers from debilitating depression (when I am cold turkey or only on pharmacy antidepressants) and very bad ocd that makes it hard to relax by my self. I have no motivation and pathetic physical stamina (I can barely do anything without getting winded) and I am terrified of the day when both my mother and father both pass away because I can not even fathom of having to live without the two closest people I have ever had that love me unconditionally no matter what.

If there is one thing I have ever been blessed with and lucky to have its 2 parents who adamantly refuse to stop loving or caring about me. I have ambitions of becoming a youtuber for money as well as going into anthropology and similar sciences and perhaps become a polymath of sorts. I have miserable physical stamina and strength, clinical depression that I have to take certain substances with to keep at bay, severe obsessive compulsive disorder that I have to this day am still in therapy in, drug cravings, not the best looks along with most girls either hating me just by me talking to them and being around them or flat out being ignored totally or just friends but I consider myself somewhat intelligent (though my intellect is nothing brilliant especially after my mind has been dulled due to substance abuse for years).

I would appreciate anybody telling me what I should do."
I want to stop taking my antidepressants,1,mkh78u,2,"They make me feel nothing. I don't feel sadness, sure, but I also don't feel excitment or joy. I want to stop, and after looking into it, I've realized that there's no clear answer as to how to do it. Everywhere says to NOT quit cold turkey, but doesn't explain how to do it otherwise. Do I take one every few days? Every two days?"
Can I take Passionflower and Antidepressants together?,6,mkh4v1,0,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5139955/

This study added passionflower to patients on the antidepressant SSRI Sertraline. There were no issues. I‘m on Amitriptyline 125mg at night. I don‘t know where but I read that Passionflower added to antidepressants can cause Serotonine Syndrome...? The study above tells the contrary. 

Maybe someone here who has experience with combining these two or knows something about pharmacological theory if it‘s possible or rather dangerous to combine them?"
Does my partner have depression? What more can I do to help him?,2,mkh3rs,0,"My partner (M30) has always been a hard worker (possibly a workaholic) and high achiever but he is shy and sometimes finds it difficult to accept compliments. Despite this he’s always been happy and would be motivated further when he allowed himself to accept praise and feel proud of his achievements. However over the last few  months I’ve seen his mood get really low. He normally always likes to be doing something practical and his mood would always be high when he completed something on a weekend e.g building a shed, trying out a new recipe etc but now he says those things don’t give him joy anymore and he often feels anxious thinking about work.

He says he can get temporary amusement in his free time from playing video games but then he’ll feel guilty for wasting that period of time. He also says his mood improves fora short while when we go out for a walk but as soon as we get home he’ll have work on his mind and gets the blues again. He is especially down on Sundays.

His boss and colleagues all seem to love him and he gets loads of praise for his work. He very recently got a huge pay rise. He was initially happy about it and seemed proud of the praising comments he received but now says he feels like he thinks his boss is just blowing smoke up his ass and he doesn’t deserve it. 
He says he feels like if he did fuck-all all day his boss would probably email him to tell him he’s a fantastic worker and it’s making him feel really low and unmotivated. He says he feels lonely in his work and just feels like he doesn’t want to do anything when he’s meant to be working. He actually did very little work during 1 week and said he didn’t get told off or anything and he feels really down about it.

He says he doesn’t think it’s from working from home / lockdown coz he goes into the office 2 days a week and still feels the same.

I’ve done little things to try and lift his mood e.g surprising him with a subway delivery for lunch; suggesting we take a walks 3 times a day. I wrote a list of things he’s done that I’m so proud of him for - this one he said actually made him feel worse and that if I ever tell him I’m proud of him it makes him feel bad. He started to drink quite a lot after work and this worried me so I encouraged him to wind that down to max of 2 glasses of spirit and to avoid drinking if he’s feeling down. I give time to listen to him speak about his day and anything he’s worried about. We also looked up therapists in the area and he says he is feeling optimistic about his first appointment in 2 weeks time but I still feel like I’m not doing enough.

He says he doesn’t think he has depression as he doesn’t feel suicidal he just feels low and lost motivation but I can’t bear to see him like this.

I hate this place hate everything hate this country hate the weather omg why can't it all happen already why do I need to take time HOW MUCH MORE TIME DO I NEED IVE BEEN HOLDING ON FOR FUCKING YEARS . I can't fucking stay like this even for another year or months the fuck. I'm turning 20 and my life hasn't even started oh my god. Ok honestly I just literally want to fucking kill myself at this point I'm so fucking done
It feels like my past has caused near irreparable damage,2,mkgmjs,0,"This is a hefty vent, and no one has to read it, but I need to get it out.

I (20F) was born into a dysfunctional family, by no fault of its members. My mom had crippling Anxiety and my dad Depression. I just so happen to have inherited both. Go me...

My brother has a form of autism that has diminished over the years. He's one of the most wonderful guys you'll ever meet, but when I was little he was abusive, and so was my dad. What happened wasn't their fault; it never, ever will be. It still hurt though. My brother would hit me over the head as hard as he could multiple times a day, and yell in my ears; they would just laugh as I cried. My dad's not a bad person, he just didn't have any other way to connect with his son, who only payed attention to my mum. I stress ate to cope with how hectic my home life was, so I got fat. This was the base of all the teasing directed at me by almost everyone I knew. My mom was never around to see it. She couldn't cope with the chaos, so she just wouldn't come home. I don't blame her.

My other memories consist of jumping from babysitter to babysitter, never feeling present, never getting attention. No one had time for me because my brother needed them more. Again, I don't blame them, but as a kid I believed no one wanted me. I hung out with bad crowds of ""friends"", always a weak link; the little fat girl that did what they wanted because she was desperate for a friend. I sat alone at recess, drawing. I felt like a corpse. Kids can be so cruel. My teachers and peers thought I was odd, and on every report card, I got bad grades. There was a note on every one saying: ""She needs to focus when the teacher is speaking."" I couldn't, being in my reality was too stressful. I never really grew out of that need to distract myself.

Then, when I was around 11, my mom had an affair. She met a guy on a website for smokers, and fell in love with him. She travelled to America a lot during that time. My dad knew, and he had nobody else but me to talk to about it. I remember the three of us: My dad, my brother and I just crying on the floor as my dad talked about what was happening. He asked me often if I thought what my mom was doing was fair. I tried to support him, but I never knew what to say. He always seemed a hair's width away from ending it all. This went on for two years, and then summer came. My mom was in America with this guy. She was planning on leaving him because he had tried meth and other hard drugs and she was in danger. Then he killed himself and she found him on the floor. I can't imagine what that must have done to her. She was in denial for months. I was a 13 or 14 year old when she came home from that trip. I tried to help her at the expense of my own wellbeing. I was there for her as a shoulder to cry on when she felt hopeless. I don't regret it, but I couldn't process it at the time.

We're a close family now, full of love, but damaged. My mom always asks me how I could be so sad and hate myself so much when I'm so loved. Sometimes I wonder if she knows the impact of all the shit that went down as I grew up. I didn't really have a great childhood. I'll never forget what my high-school counsellor told me when I opened up about my life this one time: ""How did you make it this far?"" It felt validating I guess. I didn't have an answer, still don't. Now I'm expected to be a functioning adult as if nothing ever happened. No one ever taught me how to do that.

I was kind of healing, and then 'rona hit and that all went to shit. I'm in University studying music, and I'm almost done, but the mental toll is killing me and I want to kill myself. I'm wildly depressed, but I feel like I should have my shit together. God I want to die, and it's my fault.

To anyone who read this near-novel sized post, thanks. It's nice knowing someone lent an ear (or, I guess a pair of eyes.)"
Only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I’m trying to protect my family from any further grief,207,mkghmr,17,I have a pretty large scaled family and it feels very weird each year excluding Covid putting on a mask that almost masks the misery that I feel everyday. I almost wonder if everyone else in my family does it too and has thought the same thoughts as me. If it wasn’t for my family still being here I wouldn’t be here anymore. I always fantasise if my family got killed or something I would then end it as it would give me an excuse. Shame I have to be alive just because I feel guilty of other people feeling like I’m forced to stay alive.
Bruh every time my mum yells at me I'm just like 😀 she said I have a good life. Okay how about I shoot myself rn because I'm hanging onto a literal thread around my neck because everyone in my life including you fucking suck ass.,10,mkggjp,1,I sound so edgy but r u really gonna tell me I have a good life. really. :) when all I think about is dying.

I fucking hate this place fuck y'all
Starting to realize that I'm not okay.,2,mkgcgn,0,"This is just going to be me complaining, but literally nobody in the world will listen to me so here we are.

I'm unhappy and hopeless. I'm taking an overloaded courseload, so my life is consumed in going from assignment to assignment trying to get everything in on time but I still don't feel like I really understand the things I need to to go into my career. I need an internship to graduate but I have no idea how to even go about doing that, or what they would expect of me, or how I would even be able to satisfy them. I'm totally unmotivated, just dropped a class last week. My main laptop is totally dead, the battery in my car is dead, I constantly feel dead, I don't know whether I'm dreading the future or desperate to escape the present. Probably both. 

I'm totally alone in the world: 0 friends and emotionally distant family. Town is in lockdown hell so even uni clubs are basically stopped and nothing is happening. I haven't had a conversation in months, probably. This room feels like solitary confinement, and my laziness only increases with how indifferent I am to my success and how there's nobody in the world who cares one way or the other if I succeed anyway. 

On another account, some user said something nice and hopeful to me unprompted and I started crying. My sleep schedule is fucked. My eating habits are fucked. My mental health is fucked. I don't have hobbies anymore except sleep. I often hope that I'll be caught in a gas explosion or something so that I can have a painless, guiltless exit from the world. 

And it's only very recently occurred to me that maybe I'm really not okay. I'm not starving, I've got an above-average amount of savings because I've worked for a long time and I never spend any money. But it all just feels totally empty and I only keep going out of a vague sense of obligation. Feels that if I lose my momentum then it'll be gone permanently and I'll burn out into a soulless shell of a person with no accomplishments and no means, living an uncomfortable and hard life. 

Well there's my rant, a tale told by an idiot, deflated and pitying, signifying nothing. How's your day?"
What actually works when life is shit?,3,mkfxki,6,"So, I've been wanting to ask this question for a long time now.  
Do anti-depressants actually work?  
Also, I've heard that sometimes the kicking in (ie, effect) of those medicines takes place at different times for different people.   
Like for eg: 1) Person A noticed the effects within a week 2) Person B noticed the effects within a month.

Feeling extremely lonely?,8,mkfrjr,4,"I've been reading through this sub for around 2 years now but this is my first post because I've been feeling a lot worse recently. I act like everything's fine, and from the outside, people probably think I'm living a pretty good life. What hurts the most though, is having absolutely nobody who can understand how lonely I feel and the way I mentally put myself down. For years I've felt inferior and worthless, and everything I do seems to just be a distraction so I don't drown in these thoughts. I see people doing so many fun things, setting goals for themselves, making friends and dating, but I lay at night feeling empty knowing I get to wake up the next morning as a reject and outcast all over again.

What would honestly help a lot is just knowing that I'm not the only one. Has anyone else been feeling the same way? Love you all."
other depressed people seem to still have lives - i don’t,2,mkfqtt,2,"sometimes i see other depressed people still have some semblance of a life, and it makes me feel useless. seeing even the low functioning ones function better than i do reminds me that i’m at rock bottom, and that their bare minimum is literally me at my maximum power :(

i promise i’m not saying my depression is more valid than anyone else’s because of this! actually the opposite! i’m saying it makes me feel even more hopeless about my situation, knowing i’m as low as i am. it makes me feel like a failure of a human being.

i won’t describe my lifestyle in full detail because it’s too humiliating. but i don’t go to school, i don’t work, i never leave the house (regardless of quarantine), and i don’t have friends. not a “i have friends but just don’t feel understood by them” scenario either. i haven’t socialized or bonded with someone my age in years. no one except family texts or checks in on me. i don’t go out to have fun, even for myself.

just imagine the least stimulating life you can imagine, and i’m 21 years old living it. it would be no less different if i were brain dead honestly

Finally I deleted your pictures and it hurts,3,mkfmq8,0,"I restored our picture in the hard drive but the pictures still in my phone and today I decided that I need to delete it and start healing. I cried out loud as I deleted our pictures from my phone and social media but I knew I needed to heal and let you go. We have so many wonderful memories during the 5 years of our relationship. We lived together for 4 years, we cooked, watched movies, played games, supported your hobbies, encouraged you to fulfill your dreams, cared for you when you was sick, explored the world together \[traveled\], accepted and adored your flaws, when you struggled I will always find a way to ease your struggle.  I feel sad if I'm not being able to help you. I will always have your back no matter what. I said don’t worry, if plan A doesn’t work, there’s always Plan B, it still doesn’t work, we still have C to Z. There’s always a way. We will make it.   


The day you broke up with me because of depression. I'm still there to help you for 2 months, I'm did researched for everything about depression so I can understand better and help whatever I can but you pushed me away, you told me you didn’t need my help. You said we were over, you don’t know if you still love me or not. Get your life and move on.  It hurts and yet I still not given up to help you. I called your mother and told her the situation you were going through. That was the last option I had to help you. When the day you told me, you get help from a therapist. That was the last day I called you. At least I know you gonna be fine.    
If you really don’t love me anymore, you don’t have to worry anymore. I will never come to disturb your life again. Perhaps because of my flaws and imperfections make you unhappy about me. I'm sorry I tried my best to be a good partner and your bestfriend but I still not the one you want.   I wish nothing but the best for you. I hope you will find your happiness that you deserve."

Now I don't even care, the only reason why I think about stopping is the questions I'll get if people see my scars.I just don't care about myself anymore, I don't care about the harm I'm doing to myself cause I just don't feel like I have anything in me worth the effort anymore."

I felt so bad and was seriously hating myself because of it. They've kinda stopped talk with me as much and I can't help but feel completely at fault.
Just wanted to share something on my struggle with depression.,7,mkfczr,1,"I hope this true story helps explain whats happening with me:
Many years ago we had these neighbours who kept two family dogs. Unfortunately for the dogs, when our neighbours moved out of the house they chose not to take the dogs with them. As the years passed those dogs relied on the scraps of food we gave them, and 'food' from rubbish bins. They grew old, sickly, and one of them appeared to have cognitive problems too. One day, one of the men from that family came back to the house to look for something, and those two dogs despite being very old and grey and weak ran like they were puppies towards their old owner.
 I wasnt there,but my mother said their loud cries sounded almost like people crying. The man(our old neighbour) disagreed with us when we told him that the dogs needed him, saying ""oh they ran towards me so strongly, they appear well enough to look after themselves"".


I reached out for help for my depression, i fear im relapsing. But i feel this sense of complacency whenever i actually get help  Complacency that is ruining my recovery.
Whenever Iam in the therapist office I feel So happy and grateful(for being there) that i almost cannot remember the abuse i receive from my family and relatives. Therapists expect to see a sad miserable helpless looking person for depression, who can tell them all about their miseries - but thats not what happens with me.  I feel so full of gratitude that I cant express the reality of my suffering accurately.
People say 'oh you look so good and happy, im certain your not actually depressed' ""oh your mother looks so sweet she cant be verbally abusive or emotionally manipulative""

It leads to the therapist not accepting i have depression or aspergers. Ive seen dozens of therapists, and i dont want another one to fall ignorant to my 'hidden' sufferings."
In a dark place,4,mkfbz5,3,"TW // mentions of suicide, suicidal ideation

Lately, I (22F) have really seen my depression come to a new low. I've been diagnosed for about 8 years now and have been on meds for that long though I suspect I was depressed far before then.

There's not much to this other than to say that while I've been depressed for a good chunk of my life and have wanted to die, I knew that I could never do anything to myself. I knew I'd never be able to commit or even attempt because while I crave death I also fear it.

In a sick way, I hate that about me because it makes me feel like a coward. I feel like I'm too weak to be able to even do the one thing that I want or that would end my pain. I know it doesn't make sense and it's fucked up but I don't know how else to describe it.

just wondering if anyone else has experienced this too"
I don't like being alone,2,mkfae9,1,"I'm  a intorvert so I do like being alone but when I'm have one my anxiety attacks or depressive episode, I don't like being alone.

Today I had a little of that time after some relationship turmoil that was caused by me and some irritability. 

And with that time I decided to journal and I broke down

I realized just how sad I really am all the time 
I just never know it because there’s other people distracting me from myself. 

I can never seem to pinpoint when this sadness started or how long its been lingering 

All I know is when it comes it feels like it’s always been there, lingering beneath everything else. 

All the smiles and happiness and even anger. 
I felt those truly I did. 

But when this feeling comes, it’s deeper than any other feeling I’d felt before. 

Thanks brain and company for helping me for a little while, distracting me, making me feel little bit better or evenfor just masking this deep ache in my chest. 

It hurts so much when I realize it’s never really left
The realization of the shell I’ve become. 
How much I’ve let myself slip away. 

Even when the intensity of the feeling goes away and the smiles return. 

I notice I’m not doing the things I should be doing to make myself better 

I’ve lost all motivation to get better because I’ve done it before
 I’ve gotten better

Or so I thought

Because it ALWAYS comes back And it’s like all the work I did was pointless 
Leaving me to feel like a failure and a fraud. 

I notice it’s much easier for my brain to trick me when others are around, I notice I’m instantly different (happier or just irritable) because I don’t want to explain. 

Part of me feels like sadness is weakness. 

Part of me thinks they won’t understand. 

Part of me thinks I’m overreacting or being overly emotional. 

But damn this shit hurts    

But I’ll be fine 

I’m just tired.

How to be vulnerable with your loved ones about your depression?,2,mkf6rz,1,"I’m (19f) currently really struggling with my depression and I’m feeling the need to tell my family, but it feels so weird and uncomfortable to be vulnerable with them. Growing up they were kind of emotionally distant which is why it took me so long to tell them I was depressed in the first place. 

When I did first tell them about my depression, they didn’t really believe me until they saw me have a breakdown. It’s been a few months since and they’ve done a complete 180, almost being helicopter parents now. Calling me, facetiming me and checking in with me like they never have before. 

I want to tell them how I feel since it’s clear they care, but I just don’t know how to be vulnerable with them when I never have before. When they ask, I just tell them everything is fine and going well because I don’t want to scare them or make them feel they failed as parents. I’d really appreciate any advice❤️"

Im trying,2,mkf17x,0,"I know some of y'all have seen my posts about the pills and wanted to die already, two weeks ago I was in a car accident and since that day it opened up my eyes to see how precious life is. Physically I am getting better everyday but mentally....... I don't think that is going to go way anytime soon. I just keep replaying that night, the impact of getting hit, the smell coming from the cars and I am trying my best to get through it but it is hard. Since that night I haven't abused my pills like I was doing every single day, I am not abusing my syrup like I was, I am really trying my best to get off of all that. But the past 2 weeks have been so hard physically and mentally that I just wanna down 10 percs like I was doing before all this happened. I am trying to become a better person but man is it hard.... The hardest thing has been my ""friends"" before I got into the accident I was doing everything for them, if they needed a ride I would take them and never once asked for gas money, I would take us out to eat, drink, everything and if I had money I wouldn't let them pay. I am a nice person with a good heart and pure intentions but it just got me thinking and really depressed like now that I am without a car, hurt, no one has checked to see if I needed anything and I just keep telling myself why is it like that. But maybe the accident happened to open my eyes to alot of things. So anyone thats out there feeling down right now, don't give up! You are loved and if no one has told you this, I am proud of you and you are doing enough. I love everyone who comes across this post and hopefully soon I can get my mental health better 🙁"
Strange experience with my friend. Need some opinion or a different perspective ...,3,mkf0gz,9,"Hello to everyone!

First I would like to say that I am very supportive toward people who are going through depression because I know how hard is to get out of this ""state of mind"". I wish all of you the best and the quickest recovery possible - nothing but LOVE. I am 32 years old male and I don't have clinical depression (so I am not gonna talk about how I understand everything), but I experienced some extreme depressive states in the last few months.

This is my first post here because I come to the point where I need some different perspectives/opinions of people who struggled with the same experience.

5 years ago I met my ""at least I thought BFF"". My friend was very depressive (was on some medications), was constantly negative toward the environment, and was always in a cycle of thinking negative things. Explaining all his troubles from the past, present, and fears for the future. Since I am the kind of person who accepts people as who they are, I didn't think of him ""Something is wrong with you"", but I decided to support him. Before I met my ""BFF"", I was a ""normal"" person, who experienced some depressive states, but I was never ""super depressed"". In beginning, we would hang out once per week for 4 - 5 hours + I would call him (2 - 3 hours phone conversation) every single day (and I am not overexaggerating) to check on him if he is doing OK and if he needs someone to talk to. In the beginning, his mental state was not ""affecting me"", since I was reacting positively toward him and I genuinely wanted to help him.

Not that it matters, but I was very successful in the majority of life areas in comparison to my ""BFF"". I have a master's degree in economics, my friend's high school diploma. I started to work when I was 20, my friend finds his first job when he was 30. I have a high-paying job, my friend was getting a ""social security fee every single month"". I hold a high position in my firm, my friend is working in production departments/warehouses. I had a lot of friends, my friend was considered a loner. I had a great relationship with my parents and GF, my friend was resentful with his parents and never had a life partner. I lived in a 60m2 apartment, he lived in an apartment of 10m2 and couldn't normally go to the bathroom. Like I said those things didn't matter to me, and this information will come in handy later in this Post.

Example: When he would say ""I would really like to have a job"" --> I would stay positive and tell him, that he will find the job or to focus on what he would like to do and if he needed help I can give him some pointers on how to write a CV or I can help him to find a job (use some of my connections). He didn't want to work, because was focusing on himself, and I accepted that.

Over time I started to notice that whenever we would hang out or have a phone conversation that he was bringing me ""DOWN"".  I remember one time when I would listen to him saying about past suicidal thoughts for 5 hours, I came home and I wanted to explode from all the negative energy (had a massive headache, couldn't sleep, etc.). Since I was always told by my parents, to be supportive of society and especially friends, I was thinking ""this is what a real friend should do"". I didn't panic too much. In the last 5 years, he made a lot of improvements and I am/was very happy for him. He found a job, he moved away from his parents, he started to see some girls (nothing serious), he found some friends, starting to incorporate some habitual routine toward his life (reading book, going for a walk, studying about programming, etc.). Let's just say that I saw some massive improvements in his life, and I was also proud of myself since I believe I was his ""helping hand - even if just for 1 %"". I was there for him when everyone left him!

Last 3 months I started to experience a depressive state of mind and since I was supportive of my friend for 5 + years, I thought it would be a good idea to share this experience with him since he dealt with depression his whole life and if someone could give me some pointers on how to deal with depression, it might be him. When I told him, that I have a rough period of time, he listened to me. Which felt great! But after I gave him ""insight into my personal struggle"", he started to behave differently.

He would give comments or behave like:

(1) ""I purchased iPhone, because I can and not many people can purchase it, am I right?"" --> Trying to insult me, since I don't have iPhone, which I could purchase in a heartbeat if I would want to.

(2) ""I am making money, and I saved so much money in the last 6 months, I know how hard is for you?"" --> Trying to insult me, like I can't barely buy myself something to eat. Which doesn't make sense, since I make 3 x more than him and I save money as well.

(3) He stopped calling me, and when I reach out to him, he would be rude and behave like I am a ""piece of s\*\*\*"".

(4) One day when we would hang out, he would say to me, that we need to stop or reduce our hanging time, without giving me a more specific reason. He would say something like ""You need to pick yourself up, and then we can start hanging out"" or ""I used to think of you as a Role Model, but now not anymore"".

All I want to say is this ""I was always supportive to my friend for 5 years, and I would listen to his trouble every single day and getting this negativity from him"", which to be honest had some affection toward myself and how my mental health developed. Now when I have some problems, he is nowhere around. He doesn't care for me, as much as I cared for him. It hurts! The most absurd thing is that ""He started to behave toward me like I am a loser, and he is like a person who has everything under control.

Now I understand ""Why people avoid depressive people"". Does anyone had the same experience, where (1) you accept the negative/depressive person in your life and that person affected your life in a negative way, and when you develop some mental health issue (not sure, but most likely from my BFF), they see you as a loser and they want to move on with their life?"
I’m done. I just want someone to be there for me,5,mkezzs,2,"I’ve official given up.  I fucking fate myself.  I’m just a fucking pussy to kill myself.  If someone threatened to shoot me, I would tell them to do it.  I hate living just to find myself feeling empty, lonely, depressed, anxious, nervous, shy, and so much other shit.  I care so much about the people around me and I can’t even care for myself.  It’s not that I can’t care for myself, I choose not to.  Every night, I brain forces me to relive past horrors and I can’t do anything about it besides watch as I views terrible memories like a movie in from of my eyes.  Every fucking night.  I can’t stand it anymore.  People told me things would get better but they haven’t.  Started at 11 and now I’m 16, it’s been five fucking years.  I hate life.  I through with this shit.  I just want someone to be there for me, to love me, to understand me.  I’m too shy to get a girlfriend.  I can’t get myself to do shit.  I just want all this to end, but I don’t have the balls to do it.  I am too scared that if I tell my friends about my depression they will leave me.  They are the only reason I haven’t done anything yet, and I can’t I mean can’t lose them.  Idk what to do.  I’m sorry for this rant I just needed to let out everything hidden inside me rn.  Sorry"
My friend just told me that I should kill myself and that I'm I'm waste of sperm,14,mkev7a,11,So we got into a argument and he told me he had a lot that he wanted to say to me that he has been holding back since we are friends I told him to tell me and long story short he told me to kill myself that my mom is dumb I'm a waste of money and sperm I still want to be friends with him but I don't know I am genuinely thinking of doing it because I feel like nobody in my family cares for me and that they see me as a burden and I have nobody I can talk to
I am losing my mind.,3,mket7a,1,"My loneliness is slowly killing me and will eventually kill me. Nobody talks to me. Nobody recognizes my existence. I tried everything to make friends. I have tried everything to find a partner. I have tried everything for 21 years of my life and nobody wants me. I am a 42 year old man and I cannot take it. I have been crying for the past couple of days, my chest hurts and I have moments where it is even difficult to breath. I am not okay. Nobody helps me or even tries to help me. I am losing my mind and I am not coping."
My life is pointless,5,mkemak,3,"I have hit a point where I’m entirely lost. I’m 23 and gone through a lot of crap. I’ve suffered with anxiety, panic attacks and depression since I turned 6 but I’ve never really gotten any real help. The NHS sucks and I was really let down by CAMHS when I was in their care. My therapist was lazy and discharged me with a diagnosis for autism that was later deemed redundant. But ever since, I’ve only ever been unsuccessfully put on adult waiting lists, even though I’ve a mental health history. Bit lost with that all.

Essentially, I have nothing. I’ve no friends, no passions and no career ambitions. My relationship with my parents sucks, and I’m generally just a useless person. I want to go to university and I keep trying to get my Level 3 qualifications, but I always suffer with manic episodes and suicidal tendencies due to the stress which forces me to drop out. Then I’m never able to land job interviews because I am not an attractive candidate (lack of qualifications, hospital school history, diagnoses, etc).

I’m just not sure what this is all for. I feel like I’m mostly an inconvenience to everyone. I suck and no one wants to know me. My only good friend has finally admitted I carry too many red flags for her to be comfortable anymore, and I don’t even know how to stop myself. I don’t want to be like this but nothing seems to fix it.

Genuinely, what am I expected to do? I only ever see one out these days but I don’t want to take it."
I can't listen to music anymore,34,mkelwq,22,"For the past week any and all music has sent me absolutely spiraling, I really miss the comfort that it used to bring. Has anyone else experienced this? I know it's probably my own unique situation, but I've been having such an impossible battle with my depression and any sort of solidarity might help."
I don’t know whats going on with me,1,mkelc6,1,"I don’t know if i’m depressed or not but recently I feel like there is really no point in trying at anything anymore. I don’t feel like myself, no, i feel like I never knew who I was in the first place. These thoughts all started when my childhood dog died while I was at college. I had him for 16 years and when he died I didn’t know how to feel. I was emotionally numb. I was sad for a while as anyone should be, but it didn’t feel real. I was afraid that I was just pretending to be sad, because thats just what people did when they were sad. Then I realized everything I have done up to this point in my life is all fake. I never showed my true personality to my family. I have always put up a facade anytime I’m with other people. When i’m not with others, i’m working to better keep up this facade that I’m doing well and that I’m happy. I pretend to have a personality but I don’t even know myself. I’ve been running on autopilot all my life, living like some kind of npc doing everything just to avoid conflict. Looking back, I realize I’ve never truly felt happy in my life and my emotions don’t seem as vibrant as others. Rather, they’re dull and I feel as if i’m in a consistent state of indifference. Now I see how empty of a life I seemed to have lived. I feel like I’m in a prison, never able to be myself because I’m trapped in a living body. I want to know what it feels like to be happy, but nothing I would do would ever seem to achieve this. All my aspirations and goals are empty, I just seem to copy those around me. At the same time, I sometimes think that maybe it would’ve been better if I didn’t have such emotions in the first place. I wish that I just disappear, but I don’t have the conviction to do so yet. I wish that someday, i will gain the conviction to do so myself, but I would not die before my parents."
Someone to talk to,41,mkejt0,14,"Hi. I'm 19. In the span of 4 years I've lost 4 friends, one died in a car wreck, 1 committed suicide, and the other 2 got shot. My dog had to be put down on February 11th of this year. I'm A positive person for others, but for myself, I want to die. I don't want to talk to my friends about it, I'd feel more comfortable with someone I dont know comforting me (its weird ik) I'm losing my grip on my life and I just need someone to help before I do something bad to myself."
Perpetually lost,3,mkegfo,2,"I sit here tonight, staring at this post in progress, thinking ""what do I say? How do I say it?"" Truly opening up is hard. It means I have to stop hiding my secrets, drag then out, and risk it all again. I'm sure there's tons of people who can empathize with me. I'm not alone. But logic and feeling don't always agree. Is this even the place to just lay it all out? 45 minutes a week in therapy feels so superficial, so short. It's never enough, but what do I tell her? I can't even look at her.

I'm nothing important. Nothing special. And honestly, I'm not even a good person. And somehow, I still need that validation, that... Whatever it is I need but can't ever find. I'm just... Heck, I don't know."
I don't know what to do,3,mkegay,0,I can't connect with people because I can't tell them what I believe in or what my morals are. I can't get close to anyone; my last true friend is drifting away and is the only reason way I don't lose myself to the abyss that is my mind
I’m pretty much done with this life,2,mkeep5,1,"Every story has to come to an end. This life just really isn’t worth living anymore and I’d rather finish it off sooner than later. Hopefully it’s just lights out and that’s it. The peacefulness of nothing. Complete isolation, complete darkness.

How would it be any different?"
"I am so sad, I feel it in every inch of my body",1,mkee1m,0,"I have been trying for a long time to make myself better. Started therapy, joined classes eating better. Idk if it's the fact that I'm just impatient or what but I'm not feeling any differetlnt. I'm just so  tired of feeling angry frustrated annoyed at everything. I'm so tired I don't even want to move. And it's Monday the week is just starting. I have to start working. I'm so sad"
im just gonna kill myself then,2,mkedty,5,i fucking hate humanity so much
Tired,6,mkec98,3,"I pretend to be happy around everyone else so my problems don’t become a burden on them, No one ever asks me how i feel and it’s always me to be the one helping others but they tell me i suck at giving advice and never talk to me unless it benefits them

I just wish I had real friends"
Feeling down,2,mkebxo,1,Idk i feel so empty and unappreciated inside.
Therapy didn’t work either,2,mke9wz,1,"I’m 21f and a grad student. I recently moved across the U.S. and I’ve been having a rough time transitioning. I had a pretty terrible end of year in the last few months of 2020 and that triggered my anxiety and depression. I’ve also been having su*Vidal thoughts pretty frequently. I decided to start therapy a little over a month ago and it didn’t work out the way that I had hoped it would. My therapist wouldn’t react much whenever I spoke about some of the darker things I’d gone through. She never asked how I was doing in the beginning of our sessions before jumping in to talking about my past trauma. She would often show up to our sessions late and I would have to email her to ask if she could hop online. I just felt like she didn’t really care about me or my problems. After our sessions, I never felt like I covered any bases with some of her probing questions. More recently, I terminated our sessions and she asked why. I didn’t have the heart to tell her that we weren’t compatible, so I told her that I would be pursuing different goals. I understand that therapists are also human and make mistakes, but I felt so isolated in my relationship with this particular therapist. I feel really bad about terminating because I want to get help, but I also don’t want to invest so much time into therapy that doesn’t work for me. I submitted paperwork for counseling services this past week and hopefully, I can find someone more suitable for my needs. I feel so hopeless and lost after quitting therapy because I’m starting to wonder if I’m the problem here. Don’t know where to go from here."
I’m tired to cry,1,mke9hz,0,"Well, on April 2019 I met this guy 
He was the first person who I said “I love you” he was my first love I felt so peacefully with him but the nightmare just start beginning.
8 months later we broke up for firs time, gosh I cried all day and night my mind was in white, I couldn’t accept that he wasn’t with me anymore, he cheated on me the times that he wanted and I was so blind that I didn’t accept it I couldn’t afforded it I loved him more than me and my family, and well you should wondering “was he so handsome?” Gosh no, no way, all my friends said me the same thing, he was the ugliest person you can know but well that’s not the case. However, he hit me some times, he made offensives comments about me and my body, he always blamed me for all the wrong things on OUR relationship, but well. We broke up and come back since more than 7 months, but today... He met another girl, and he stated to date her... and he looks so happy... 
he destroyed me, he made me so fucking insecure about myself, he’s the worst person I know... but I still loving him... he caused me depression, I took pills for that shit, and he just dating another girl... i loved him... it was a honest love, the most beautiful love you can think, and he just go... now I’m just in a bed, thinking what is wrong with me...
He knew all my insecurities, and he hit them, just in the exactly point..."
I self harmed again,2,mke7yo,3,"I self harmed again after quite a while I'm not sure how long maybe a year. I used to do it everyday in middle school but I slowed down significantly after my sophomore year of high school. Last time I ""relapsed"" (if u can call it that) I didn't get what I wanted from it and it didn't make me feel different. This time was different and I want to do it more tomorrow. Why did this happen? Why do I keep coming back to this? What does it mean that I don't want to stop?"
Losing interest in everything,6,mke6v9,2,"This is the third time I've struggled to write this in the last week. 

On a downward spiral at the moment. I'm struggling. Struggling to be who I'm expected to be. The work colleague,  the husband, the father, the friend. 

My temper is out of control. I'll fire up to 11 over spilt milk. I'm constantly yelling, looking for fights. Aching for someone to look at me sideways. I feel like everything I've ever loved has either been taken away from me or is leaving on its own accord.

I feel like I'm constantly being put on the back burner,  my needs, my feelings, while I hold everyone up on a pedestal around me. Trying to make others feel good and give from me to them to fulfil theirs needs. Especially the kids. But I'm struggling to love lately,  struggling to find happiness with them,  all I do is yell at them. 

The things I use to enjoy being me no happiness no more,  no joy, no elation. In a house full of people I love and things I use to desire,  but feel so empty and lonely. Not lonely enough to want company,  I'm beyond that, I don't care for it. I don't even want to pat my little dog any more

I don't want to be any more. I am tired of having to be. I'm tired of everything"
I'm spiraling again,3,mke3s8,1,I moved back in with my parents over two years ago to give me a chance to heal. I've not worked in three years. I thought I was finally making progress and getting better. Last month I finally moved back out on my own. I'm spiraling. I don't know what to do. I've also just timed out of my treatment program
I hate being depressed and horny,6,mke2vb,0,The post nut clarity hits harder than ever. But I really need that 2 seconds of happiness.
My only friend I have known for 9 years is completely ignoring me,1,mke2pi,5,"     This shouldn't be fucking with me, but he just leaves me on read and hangs up calls immediately. I can't stop feeling like its my fault, its been 2 months. He was the only person I would ever talk to so I've just been super lonely sitting in my room. I just feel completely useless, and I feel like shit for thinking that people should have to talk to me."
"I still cry over a 16 year old boy's death (murdered by his friends) 9 years ago, even though I never knew him.",4,mke065,1,"I don't know why, but this death always makes me feel immensely sad whenever I think about it. It was in Winter, the 16 year old boy was having some kind of night out with his friends. I'm not sure how long he'd known these friends, but he was seen at at a McDonald's with these friends, and wasn't seen alive again. The boy was reported as missing and a search was underway. Early the next morning, he was found in his car in the middle of nowhere, dead and half-frozen. He'd been choked to death and from what I recall it was quite violent as bruises were repeatedly mentioned.

The suspects were never charged due to insufficient evidence. None of the boy's belongings were taken and no motive was revealed. The case remains officially 'unsolved' to this day and from what I recall only one or two YouTube narrators ever mentioned the case with updates. It's like everyone just..forgot about him. His death didn't even get into the national news and it was only mentioned in a few papers.

I just think, it must've been so scary to be alone at night in the middle of nowhere with a group of three friends who seemed completely normal up until that point with him in the car with them, then they (for no apparent reason) turned on him and killed him. That's like a living nightmare. Then to add insult to injury the suspects were never charged so the kid (and his girlfriend) doesn't even have any closure.

This case kind of makes me want ghosts/spirits to not be real, because if his ghost/spirit is still wandering around, I feel like your murderers getting away with murder would be absolute torture and you still don't know why they just killed you out of the blue in a really painful slow way. If that happened to me I think I'd have a massive mental breakdown in my mind as I died.

I wish there just could have been someone walking by so they could've saved him. Then he'd still be alive.

He'd be 25 years old now. Sometimes I get reminded of his death and I cry. I imagine the terror he went through and the fear, the hopelessness, the terrified look on his face, the feeling of betrayal, how it was all dark/alone in that car, everything. For some reason he tends to come up in my dreams a lot, like I'll dream that it comes up in the newspaper that he made some miraculous recovery in the hospital, and he awoke from a coma and he's still alive. I get excited and happy, then I wake up and realize it's just a dream and he's gone.

If I ever travel to the town/state he died in, I'd make it a point to get some flowers for him and leave them at his grave.

(To the boy) I hope that wherever you are right now, you're safe."
I don’t feel numb anymore I’m just sad as fuck again,3,mkdwee,0,"The numb feeling is over, I constantly am relying on talking to people to not feel insanely stressed and worried about everything

Lately I have been hitting up so many random girls, either online or girls I know, or exes.. at first out of boredom but then keeping conversations going when I can, desperately trying to find a connection but I just can’t anymore. I don’t know what that is. I used to be so willing to love and share that but now I just get annoyed by every little thing from them. I think I need help. I’ve been constantly visiting this sub for a week now"
Lonely as all hell,4,mkduls,1,"I wish I had a partner. Like realistically speaking I don’t think I’m ready for it yet. Really I know I’m not. But it still hurts to see practically everyone else around me having somebody or at least enough friends to keep them from struggling so much with the urge. I can’t talk to anybody about my feelings either cause I’ll just get hit with what I ALWAYS do. “You’re too young for a relationship” “Relationships are hard work” “You’re never gonna get married” “You don’t need a boy in your life” “Marriage ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.” Thats just a few things I hear/have heard the instant I do much as mention a boy or dating. Hence why I’ve stopped talking to anybody about it. But still. Suffering in silence is no better. I not only want someone to be intimate with, I want someone to just talk to. Hang out with. Do my favorite things with. Get in petty arguments with just to apologize and forget about it later. 


But no. People try to scare me into staying single by telling me horror stories about their relationships, either past or current. Not to mention my own parents didn’t even stay together and had a horrid relationship that ruined the whole family. So unfortunately I don’t have good role models where it matters most either. And with my mental/emotional problems if makes me think, who’d what to put up with me? What if we end up hating each other after like a month and split up? After all none of my platonic relationships have really gone well either. Why would a romantic one be any different? What if people just guilt me for being with someone instead of staying single? What if my dad doesn’t approve? He’s the kind of person to sense one thing wrong about a guy and send him running, preventing me from having any further contact whatsoever. Which I think is one of the main reasons I can’t talk to guys. I’ve never been allowed to even be friends with one. And as long as I’m living with my dad I don’t be able to. Even though I’m 20. Not to mention the only guys I seem to attract are literal creeps, like old men who are pervs or young guys who just want in my pants. Even then it’s just the never ending doubt. The what if’s, never stop. 

So I guess I’ll either be stuck being alone for good or I’ll end up in a relationship and unhappy. At least that’s what everyone’s convinced me. Stupid as it seems it’s got me crying in the middle of the night. This is why I feel like it’s better to be cold and distant. Emotions are such a waste of time."
I dont even know anymore,4,mkdt0q,2,"I'm 14 and I find myself putting up a humorous and cheerful persona around people I bottle my real emotions up and barely cry apart from when it all comes out on random nights

During it I think of how much I wish to love/be loved but I dont feel I deserve it 
I also think about how much I hate myself more of being overweight as I gained much weight over the past 2 years 
I isolate myself from others around me but I do want to be around people but I just cant find the energy to do anything really 

Theres a bit more but I'm not comfortable talking about it right now"
I think failed my checkpoint,3,mkdswg,1,Hello. I’m 11 years old and today I just took my checkpoint exam. It was English. It was also really hard. There was this section where you had to write an essay but i was panicking since there wasn’t enough time for me to complete it. The essay was to write about an newspaper article but I wrote a completely different theme. What should I do? I’m gonna fail my checkpoint exam. Any suggestions on how to boost my confidence up?
Fuck summer.,2,mkdqdv,2,"I can't take this hear anymore! It's too hot! I'm getting headaches and nausea and I can barely function. I'm struggling to pay my AC bills and if this keeps up any longer, I might not work/study and end up in the hospital or worse. Cooking is absolutely the worst, I can't stand the extra heat and I'm too broke for home delivery.

What can I do to cool down?"
Coping Methods,3,mkdpzr,4,Diagnosed with bipolar 2 Currently going through a depression episode right now seeing a therapist in a month. Off medication at the moment I’m not a huge fan of pills. Just want to know what Healthy coping methods you guys use that help out when feeling hopeless. Sorry my mind is really foggy right now and can’t think straight.
Just learned my job may be at risk and I'm depressed again,3,mkdpii,0,"Today my manager told me the GM feels I may not be doing enough at work and wanted me to list my task and responsibilities. I also learned the GM doesn't know I work 5 days a week instead of 6. I assumed I could work 5 days because I'm on-call.

I feel extremely upset about learning this because I do a lot of work that no one else could but to them it doesn't seem to be enough. I already feel stressed out everyday and I'm afraid if they take my two day away I'm going to breakdown.

My depression has already kicked in and I'm assuming the worst of what's going to happen. If it comes to that I have to do 6 days, I plan to tell the GM that I won't be on-call and I'm going to put my phone on DnD everyday after work.

Sorry for the rant. I wasn't really looking for an answer, but I just wanted to let my feelings out because I have no one in real life who would listen. It would be nice if anyone has a story about a situation at work that worked out on your favor."
Birthday,1,mkdpgm,0,My bday was yesterday it was a good day but to see how time flies bye and how many people were left in my past just killed me. I’ve been growing numb lately and I just wanted to talk to one person the whole day they were busy and then when I did have the chance they didn’t respond. I’m usually great at keeping it all built up and not breaking down but it’s been very hard I don’t know what to do with myself anymore.
My life is just a mess and I want to die,5,mkdoaw,2,Me 14m have been struggling with getting diagnosed with autism it's all but  confirmed I show all signs pointing towards it and my government isnt helping (britain) I sliced my hands with glass and sharp plastic and I'm no longer in school due to my problems please can I just have some advice I can't do this anymore

Depression paradox(?),2,mkdlkc,4,"I'm not really sure to call this a paradox, and I've never actually told anyone, not even my therapist this, but does anyone else relate to the feeling of hating yourself, but then hating that you hate yourself, im trying to put it into words work with me here. But it's like you get pissed at yourself but then when you do start to say those terrible things about yourself, you say to just stop being a baby, you're fine, but then hate those thoughts as well? Like you just don't deserve those thoughts, or the thoughts of not deserving them. If you're able to understand me, hopefully someone can relate, thanks for listening to my rambles."
Why does he have this power,5,mkdjc3,4,"A little while ago, I finally cut off a toxic, narcissistic, asshole of a ""friend"". I was in a depressive state for weeks after that and now I finally get better, he finds a way to talk to me. He didn't say anything, didn't do anything, he just said hello to me. And now I'm back in a depressive mood and I'm having one of my anxiety related tics, and its awful. He has this power, and it pisses me the hell off."
I miss myself,9,mkdimq,4,I don't want to feel all of this. All my life I've always tried being a good person helping others. I don't know what wrong did I do to deserve this. I just want to be happy again. I want to feel proud of myself. I want to prove that i'm not a mistake. And knowing the fact that I can't be how I used to be kills me. I feel like ending all of this. I just don't want to feel any of this.
Nf said it best,11,mkdhrp,1,"Millions of us just like you!

Suicide hotline experience,2,mkdhnl,1,(My experience is different from others I am not encouraging people to not use this hotline This is the rant of my own personal experience)  seems like people don’t give a fuck about your experiences. I talk to some lady earlier and I vented a little bit to her and it just seem like she did not care the entire time I was venting to her literally crying it just seems like she wasnt interested she just wanted to go home I don’t know like if some of y’all experienced people how to suicide room which is similar to this color but I tried calling back after she left it was put on hold about 15 minutes and by the time I got somebody in the line they told me to call back in a little bit. I don’t know about you but if I was really suicidal I would’ve just taken my wife right now like yeah I want to dieKill myself for it but I know there’s probably people out there who want to do it more than I do and the fact that that line this was a miserable failure makes me wonder who even fucking cares about people like us?
Mourning over a lost weekend,3,mkdfwt,0,"Ok, the title is a bit dramatic.... but this Easter weekend I pushed myself to make plans. I had almost a full weekend planned, a nice hike, a movie and some ice skating.... but my housemate didn't send through rent on time and it came out of my account and it got overdrawn. I literally lost all the money I had for the weekend! So all those plans were cancelled and I've been sitting at home all weekend like a usless blob. I really hate how things like this happen and it just sends me into a depressive spiral, I was feeling ok, I just hate how emotionally fickle I am, one small inconvenience and I'mnot getting out of bed. I've forced myself to go out a couple of times and just walk around my neighbourhood, but it doesn't feel the same.
Anyway, I really hope everyone else had a better weekend than I did!"
Hope this doesn't depress anyone on a religious holiday,2,mkdd8q,1,I tried to kill myself again.
My last year has been brutal and it’s only getting worse,1,mkd8wy,0,Since March 2020 my life has been slowing getting worse and worse and I’m fucking losing my mind. The worst feeling is when you think things are getting better and they immediately get 100x worse than they were before. Genuinely just feeling defeated and alone.
I don’t want to feel anymore,2,mkd8v3,1,I dont want to feel sad or scared or anxious or nervous anymore. I am tired of worrying I’ll be abandoned or that I’m not good enough or pretty enough or funny enough or anything enough to be loved. I know I’m supposed to find my own self worth but I can’t. I just want it to be over. I want to feel nothing because I feel too much and nobody else even cares. I want something real but it doesn’t exist and I’m too naive and idealistic  to understand that. I’m just always gonna feel alone and I want to fade away
hello.,7,mkd7pj,2,"hello. I know there are many posts on this subreddit, but I hope if you are already reading this, you will stay.

I’m not sure what’s happening with me, but I’ve been this way ever since I was a child. My childhood wasn’t amazing, I had to live with a manipulative and mentally (sometimes physically) abusive mother up until I was 16. I’m now going to be 21, and if anything feel as if I’m in a worse place although my relationship with my mother is the best it has ever been. I always thought perhaps she was the reason for my depression, and that not having her in my daily life would be the answer.


I’ve accomplished many things since I left her home, but truly I’m not interested in anything or have any goal that I want to live towards. I’m in school, for once in a good position (shelter/food wise), and have a girlfriend and friends that love me very much.


I was begging for these blessings before, because all my life I felt that with them I wouldn’t feel like I needed to disappear, that I am too sensitive and this world wasn’t meant for me, and still to this day I feel the same way despite having the care and resources that I wished for.

Although my depression has gotten better, the never ending feeling of I wasn’t meant for this world is still here. I still have terrible days where I can’t leave my bed and can’t control my emotions, but for the most part I’ve been taking care of myself and trying to be more optimistic. Even while being optimistic, I still feel like this is not going to stop.

I feel like saying I want to d-e is more hardcore than what I really feel, when I just want to peacefully pass away. I don’t want anymore pain, I don’t want a sad ending. I want to be able to tell the people I care about that it’s okay if I leave because my soul wasn’t ready to be in this world, and hopefully in another lifetime it will be.

The only thing keeping me here is my 1 year old dog who is so amazing and loves me so much. I will miss her the most and cry at night thinking about how much she will miss me.

I’m going to give myself one more chance and try to find meaning, or whatever else it is that will make me feel comfortable being here. Thank you if you read this all the way through."
I don't care anymore about shit,3,mkd72v,4,"So, I am a high school student(13). I have never had a friend in my entire life. I saw my mom getting beaten almost everyday by dad. My sis tried defusing the situation but now, she is just the spectator. My dad cheated on my mom. My relatives' children were just spoilt so now they want to leech off of me and get profit. My mom just beat me every other day, my sis just watched. I got bullied by classmates in break. The teacher just watched while I got beaten by them. My mother told me to get good grades, so I did score the best grades in my entire school, but I was still getting bullied. I thought piano would help but it didn't. I did learn a lot of hard pieces of the piano but it never sufficed. I learnt japanese just to forget about it. Eventually it just came back. Counsellors, netizens and everyone just told me that life gets better. It didn't. I am just the same, getting bullied everyday, get beaten at home, emotionally absent. My sis is trying to cut ties with our family. Grades didn't help me. Musical instruments didn't. A language didn't. Counsellors didn't. I guess I just don't care about anything now."
Null (random rant),2,mkd357,0,"I’m hopeless right now. I can’t do the things I love anymore without feeling empty. I can’t smile for more than 5 seconds. I’m buried in expectations from my parents to be a perfect student. I run back and forth between practice and school. I can’t sleep for longer than hours at a time. I can’t sit still and enjoy life without being interrupted by thoughts or people. Each day I grow numb to my emotions and I push the people I enjoy away. I just want to feel someone next to me or to just have a hug or something, Jesus. I just want to feel something other than the heart beat in my chest or the shaking of my hands."
Cant seem to get out of this spiral!,1,mkd12p,4,"For the last few years, I've realized that Ive been slowly slipping deeper and deeper into a loss of control/depression. Two years ago my mother was fighting terminal cancer and in hospice here at my house. To top it off, while i was taking care of her, i also got diagnosed with testicular cancer. Unfortunately I lost my mom who was my best friend and the only true support I always had. I was fortunate enough to get through my battle and I'm currently still in remission. After that covid hit not much later and I was permanently laid off from a decent paying career of 10 years. For the last year ive been on unemployment, not searching for a job, just diving into alcohol and finding anything to take me away from this reality. I take care of my father now, and just constantly think and worry about death, being alone, not finding love, and feeling worthless. I know partying and drinking is probably a big cause of my feelings but I also am just so exhausted from all that has gone on in the last few years. Im afraid to really show true emotions to pretty much anyone. I go through these phases where I just want to be alone but once I am, i want company & vice versa. I feel so alone, I dont have a girlfriend because Im a rather wild guy and show no signs of being a good partner right now. Im an artist and even my desire to create has slowly dwindled away. All I wanna do is lay in bed and watch movies if im not out drinking. Nothing seems to matter, life is so strange, Id like to feel loved by someone but even the last girl I dated ghosted me and now my good friend is dating her. Before that my ex of 7 years cheated on me and is now married living in another state. I dont know what the point is anymore besides just wasting away. Idk this is my first post ever and I'm kinda ranting, thanks to whoever reads this. Beneath it all, there still lies some hope deep inside of me but boy oh boy its fading fast."
Pushed away my last friend,3,mkd0me,7,"Random impulse told me to, so I did. I thought I might feel something, but I was wrong. She's a cool person but Im an asshole who always plays the victim when I do dumb shit, and Im doing just that by making this post, but who gives a fuck. I may not be *the* victim, but I am a victim. I don't think when I speak, and I'm unwilling to change for the better. I deny help when it's offered, and I hurt all the people around me. I'm broken and flawed and would be better off alone anyway. She's going to get better now that I'm not dragging her down, and I'll probably put myself over the edge and finally let go"
I can't,1,mkczpo,2,I just can't. I can't do anything anymore. I'm so hungry. I've barely eaten anything for like a week. I just went to get some food cause I'm so hungry. Then i started crying. Now I'm back home with no food. I don't want to be like this anymore..I just don't want to be at all honestly..
I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life,2,mkcxi7,2,(Which hopefully won't be long) I deserve to be alone and I wouldn't have it any other way.
Finally getting help!,2,mkcwna,0,"About 2 months ago, I knew I needed to seek help because if I hadn’t, I probably wouldn’t be here right now! Depression and anxiety runs on my moms side of the family. I found a therapist by myself and she helped recommend a psychiatrist. I’ve been on anti-depressants for about a month now and couldn’t be happier! My family has seen me happier and will continue seeking help! Never give up! Life is precious and sweet, and short that there are people to help! I’ve been through depression for about 10 years, being 25 now, I’m gonna live life to the fullest 😝"
No one can hear me,2,mkc777,1,"Nobody. Not my family, friends (hahaha i ghosted them all), or my therapist. I'm sick of it all.

I guess it has something to do with the way i am. I'm stubborn and insecure and i'm just tired of it all. I'm 18 and i live with my grandparents and mom. I have no job, i dont go to school. I hate myself. I live with my abuser. My dad left me.

I'm constanlty being reminded of how bitter and useless i am. I have a nasty codependent relationship with my mom. My grandma nitpicks at everything i do.

I hate my skin. I just want to tear apart my skin just so i wont feel so fucking trapped. My mood swings are crippling and it hurts so fucking bad and i can't even tell anyone without feeling like a burden. Its not that no one cares. Its more like people want you act like everything is fine so it doesn't inconvience them. For my dad i have to shut the fuck up because 'its life'. 

For my therapist its those DBT skills they act like is so fucking legendary. Everyone around me is telling me to not let this 'sickness' or depression get in the way in my life. To me its like telling someone with a broken leg to not let that get in the way of running. Like what the fuck? I don't let depression affect aspects of my life IT JUST DOES. I try to do things to make it less painful and i just can't do this anymore. I'm sick of myself. Of being surronded by the same four walls. Knowing this post is going to get lost and i can't really blame anyone for it. No one wants to hear someone bitch about how fucked up their life is. But i'm doing it anyway. I have a cringy tumblr vlog i use to write out all my violent thoughts about myself."
Just a thought,2,mkcu7b,1,"Most people won’t kill themselves because they think of all the people who would get heartbroken if they died.
Its very selfish to think that way if you think about it but I think everyone still uses that selfishness to keep themselves alive for as long as possible.
Then there’s people who was given the gift to know that nothing you will ever do is going to  matter. The people with this much freedom commits suicide."
Tired.,2,mkcr39,1,That’s it. I’m really tired.
How am I supposed to tell my therapist ( sorry alot of swearing),1,mkcq3e,1,"Holy shit I feel like I'm suffocating. I almost killed myself, but I wasn't going to do it I knew I wasn't. What if next time I don't know if I am or not. I want a different life so bad. Anything, I would rather be kidnapped and trafficked across the country than this shit. How am I supposed to go to school, I can't do it. Why does all this shit have to happen right now, like just give me a fucking break. My mom fought with her boyfriend today, brought back great memories. Really makes me want to stay there. I'm getting mad at everything and getting my at myself for getting mad. My thoughts are so irrational and it infuriating. And The fucking shit covered chairy on to is my cat is missing. So in the span of 5 days I lost my cat and my dog got cancer. I have 3 e's and I'm about to fail another class. I got all the work I'm supposed to do for spring break and did none of it. Why can't I get a break. Honestly I wish I could go to a mental ward just to get a break. Sorry I'm probably gonna post like 8 more times, but tonight is gonna fucking suck."
When I was a kid,3,mkcnhc,3,"I had always wanted to have friends, but I never could really make them. I was the girl that was weird and had interests the other kids didn’t have, so I became the outcast as a result. I remember finally gaining the courage to join a club. I ended up being a part of this reading team. Essentially we’d read as many books off e reading list as possible, and then we’d attend competitions at other schools where we answered questions about the books and earned points depending on the difficulty of the question and whether we got it right. This was the closest I had ever gotten to making “friends” at that age, and when the year ended and I learned there was no reading team in high school I cried like a baby while my mother held me. It was pathetic, I knew this, especially since some of the people on the team still made fun of me and were only nice to me because they knew I read the most books out of all of them. I guess it was just the feeling of being needed for once that made me feel good about myself. I had a similar experience when I joined yearbook and discovered I was actually a pretty good photographer. However, that ended in a similar way.

As a young adult though I have plenty of friends. People who truly care about me, and would never intentionally hurt me. Friends who appreciate me for who I am, but when I get super depressed like I am now I kind of close myself off. I have this thought that there is no way someone can love me when I’m in this state. In the state of crying into my pillow and envisioning how much easier it all would be if I just gave up entirely. I think I keep waiting for the day I’m magically better, but as time goes on I realize that there is no such thing as getting better. I will always have generalized anxiety disorder and persistent depression disorder. I will always have these episodes where it feels like I’m drowning in a sea of pure darkness, and sometimes I debate if it’s truly worth it. I wonder if I’m actually being a good friend to my friends, or if they’d be better off without me in their life being inconsistent. The thing is nobody has ever told me that I’m not worth it and that I’m a burden. Well, at least nobody who is currently friends with me. I mean there are plenty of people who have told me some pretty terrible things, and who have dubbed me a shit person who doesn’t deserve the air they breathe. It took years of counseling to come to the realization that sometimes people are just mean and what they say isn’t necessarily the truth. When my mom died I lost a lot of friends. People I was sure cared about me and who I cared about in return. People I would have answered the phone for in a heartbeat and people who had fond memories with. You see, I don’t think anyone can really tell who is their friend and who isn’t until that friendship is put to the test. For me, that was when my mom died. The people who are still here today are those that truly care about me, and the people who left are those who were simply using my friendship for their own selfish gain. It took me a long time to realize this and stop beating myself up. It took sitting down with my counselor and listing every shitty thing that they had done to me to realize that they were never really my friends to begin with.

But then I get into these head spaces. The negative head spaces where it feels like someone is sitting on my chest while I cry, and I realize that maybe they were right. Maybe I am just this shitty person who lies all the time and has never been a good friend to anyone. The lord knows I have never been honest to people about how I truly feel unless they’re my counselor. I have never told people how sometimes the emotional pain of existing and things not going the right way makes me want to take a knife and plunge it into my jugular. That I think about how much of a burden I am and how everyone would be happier if I just following my thoughts to the edge of that bridge and flung myself off. So I close myself off from them, and I don’t answer their texts and when they ask to play games I feign business as a reason why I can’t. I know it’s selfish but I don’t have the energy to entertain them like I usually do when I’m in these states. Can you imagine it? Wanting friends so badly for years, and now I finally have them but I’m too sad to even answer a text message? 

Don’t worry. I’m not actually going to do these things. I have learned to cope through these emotions and hang on long enough until they pass, but that doesn’t make any of this any less difficult and I would be lying if I said that these constant episodes simply exhaust me at this point. God why can’t I just be happy?"
disappear,1,mkclju,1,"i don't want to die, I just want to close my eyes and disappear forever. I wish I could just evaporate into thin air not leaving a trace of myself behind, becoming a lost memory"
really been struggling lately,2,mkcdfg,0,i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago but i’ve been struggling with it for much longer. eventually i learned how to deal with in on my own so that i don’t hurt myself or make self destructive decisions but recently it’s been getting bad again. something will very slightly trigger me and then i get into a mood for a few days or maybe a few weeks. this usually entails distancing myself from things i enjoy doing and people i might normally enjoy being around and just feeling empty and sad. i try and get help by talking to people about how i’m feeling but i just get so tired of getting the same responses and then feeling worse about myself. i just feel really lost and i’m wondering if anyone can tell me how they deal with this (also i’m on escitalopram)
working + school while depressed and anxious 24/7,5,mkcaby,1,honestly nothing adds on to my anxiety and depression more than knowing i have to go to work and put forth effort and then focus on school after work. i hate school so much but i can't move forward in life without school. but i also hate working. but i also need money. ugh
It's hard to be confident when constantly being rejected/ghosted,14,mkca6q,0,"I'm honestly not asking for sympathy as I'm way too drunk to care about that and in my own feelings but honestly. I've hated my appearance 85% of my life and in the last couple years I've been quite confident and working on my overall appearance and general attitude ngl. But honestly constantly getting rejected over and over not even able to make any solid connections, let alone hobbies or whatever it may be, there just seems to be an ABSOLUTE magical barrier. Even with fwb or anything because sexual or not I've been so alone I just would really like any type of personal connection.

But even with all this over the years, suicidal thoughts have been insane in my brain, but honestly they're not scary, or enticing or whatever. They're boring because honestly I'd like to live, but I want the pain to stop and everything in life I try to do to make it better hasn't worked. As of now I'm not going to do it as that'd be stupid in my head. But if I had a ultimatum to make that would stop me feeling like this by tomorrow, that'd be the only way I could see plausible. 

This is all now sounding really cringe but honestly it's how I feel and on a one on one talk with most this wouldn't be cringe but a serious talk so honestly I'm just venting on here cause I have no one to do this to."
Thought about sucide but I don’t want to die.,2,mkc6if,8,"So when I was first diagnosed September 2019, I had thought about suicide. I never attempted it. I never wanted to really die. I thought about how I could. I took note of all the pills in my house. How I could easily overdose with my bottles of epilepsy medication and my moms attanilal. I counted pills I had left. I thought how I could run to the beach and go in the ocean. I could jump of a roof. But I never tried. I never attempted it. I wanted to be alive. I had people I loved that loved me. I had music. Now a bf. I had a job I liked. But I still thought about suicide. I wrote a song today about this. I know this is kinda ranty, but has anyone had a similar  experience, any advice? Thanks. I thought I was doing really well with my depression, but I guess not."
I have no sex drive. Help.,2,mkc4aw,4,"Hi, 18f, I’m not currently on any medication for depression, but I have been on 5 in the past. I have treatment resistant depression, and every day is hard to live, but I’m willing to try for a while longer before giving medication another shot. The worst part is that I don’t get aroused at all. This negatively impacts my connection with my boyfriend and I want to.. for lack of better phrasing, I want to be horny. Any advice?"
What is everyone hiding?,2,mkc3f7,2,There’s no way I’m in the same way of the way things are as people that I can see. Everyone is in on something I’m not able to know. I know everyone else knows why the admin think I don’t know that they are lying. There’s something I’ve forgotten that explains why none of these things make any sense. Do you understand? There’s a short story where they take kids that are useless because they missed a few notes playing the piano or some other shit and do a surgery called unwinding where they take apart the body bit by bit while the person is alive and then use all the parts for transplants. Maybe they’re unwinding me. Maybe the admin told my psychiatrist that I haven’t published shit so he started adjusting three drugs at once to nuke my brain so they can unwind it. Put my neurons in a student that works right and knows whatever it is that the humans are hiding from me. Please help me make sense. I don’t have anyone to help me. If I tell my psychiatrist he’ll send the police to ruin my life. I don’t know how to get out. I just want everything to stop.
I’m back at it again,2,mkc3ci,3,"Have been on 5 depression medication and I’m on number 6 right now. 3 different anxiety meds also. For some reason my brain said go fuck yourself tonight and I’m depressed again. Contemplating going back to smoking weed so I don’t off myself. Every fucking time I swear I feel better for a while and then back in the hole. I’m on meds for bipolar disorder rn but haven’t been diagnosed. My dreams are better than reality and I feel like a lazy sack of shit. Back and fourth over and over, friends barely talk to me and I feel lonely. The worst is when I try to do things to make me feel better and it has literally no effect on how I feel. That really brings me down even worse. Feel like there’s a god damn rat in my brain shitting and pissing and clawing away and eating my brain and burrowing in so I don’t feel shit and hate myself. Welp that’s all I got."
Depression /Teen,2,mkc2bc,0,Hey! I’m only 16 years old & I can say my life has been hell. I feel so exhausted & empty it hurts so bad . I’m just so tired of everything. Everyone seems to be doing good & I just wish I was doing good as well . I’m just so numb inside so tired of my life it hurts to the point of where when I cry there’s no sound anymore it’s just tears like I cry every single day it hurts so much I’m not okay . I just wish things were so different.
"I’m stuck (vent) (tw: rape, abuse)",2,mkc19l,3,"I’m transgender and have been struggling with depression since I was a kid. I was abused growing up after my mom died from cancer when I was 3 years old. At 10, I moved in to my grandmas house where her husband raped me dozens of times. I’m now 17 and have 2 months left before I am kicked out and have to pay 400 dollars each month (I have no job.) the reason I’m being kicked out is because of being a slightly messy person due to depression.  I recently got top surgery and was prescribed anti depressants. I cleaned up my act and my room, and still it’s not enough. I have no where to go no one wants me. I’m stuck in a hard place with no hope."
"I'm so tired of coming back to this state, I have the mindset of not wanting to wake up after tonight again",1,mjp8zy,0,"This started when my boyfriend came by to pick yp a few things tonight. We've had a lot of complications lately which started in January this year, so to improve our relationship we decided to love separate from each other for at least a little while.

Well he barely acknowledged me, didn't even hug or anything. He told me earlier he would hang out with me but when he got here he kept saying while talking to his friend, who was helping him put, that he was going to go straight home and go to bed. He didnt even try to tell me sorry raincheck, o just stared at him in emotional hurt. Yesterday after i paid for our lunch he walked out of the restaurant without saying anything to me and text me fifteen minutes later telling me to meet him at the car, he needed his laundry out of my trunk.. yet less than an hour before he told me he wanted to hang out after lunch. 

Ive been communicating to him how his actions and mood swings are affecting me, he says aorey a lot and that he will make ot up to me but he keeps repeating the moodiness and changes his mind daily, sometimes a few times a day.

There's other events and words that have been said which greatly offended me recently but I dont want to type a whole lot
 Now i feel damaged, rejected, toyed with, and honestly i just want to bleed out tonight and or never wake up again so I can stop going through this pain.


Im so done with the constant downs."
Is depression treatable without going to a therapist?,1,mjsffx,0,"If yes, how?"
Apathy,2,mkbyl3,1,"My boyfriend of 7 months broke up with me half a week ago. I cried every night and talked to him over the phone every night. I was incredibly broken hearted. Today, I feel apathetic...about everything. Nothing I’m doing is making me happy or sad, I’m just existing. I don’t know what to do. At least when I was sad I knew I was normal, now I’m not feeling anything at all. Did I break? What happened to me? I just want to feel something again."
What am I living for?,1,mjtaq2,0,"I've lost everyone in my life, no family or friends come to see me. I feel like the only way out is to start all over with people. I fell into a depression last year and almost didn't make it to 2021. I stopped eating, paying bills, using a phone, going outside, sleeping normal hours and lost all motivation to live. The not eating part of my depression led to most problems. I need to see a doctor but afraid to leave my home. I take Kratom now for energy just to do simple things. It's not fair I have to live feeling like this, why did this happen? I need a fresh start in life IDK just feel like I'm surviving and not living. My biggest concern each day is eating food, moving my body. The feeling I had from being bed bound was horrible. I have one neighbor who tries to be my friend and I feel so bad I can't return the favor because I'm like insane in the head. I really think I have a mental illness because I live like the Unibomber tbh. At one point I was scared to open my fridge and dishwasher and stuff rotted away. I need meds but afraid to see a doctor."
Can't seem to feel happy,2,mkbtns,1,"So, a bit of background first. I'm 33, 3 children (oldest turns 6 on Tuesday), diagnosed/suggested that I have persistent depressive disorder from a therapist in college, I work nights for my local 911 dispatch, and I have never attempted suicide but have come close to forming a plan before.

I go through cycles of up and down like anyone else but, with the above mentioned persistent depression, I seem to have more lows than highs. And, it seems, like I'm stuck in a rather persistent rut lately. There's all sort of things to be happy about too. Like I've taken some big steps to get my personal finances in a much better place (things I've been wanting to do for a long time), I'm on the verge of getting promoted, had a conversation with my wife recently about how we're the most confident in our relationship we've ever been. 

But whenever I think about all of these reasons I should be happy I get this sad sinking feeling. I'm the type of person that wants to talk about it but don't feel like I have anyone I can go to. I don't want to throw my wife under the bus, because she's an awesome person and an awesome wife, but being able to provide catharsis for my persistent sadness had never been something I've been able to go to her about, just not one of her strong points. Kids introduce so much stress, it's normal but doesn't mean it's any easier. The house is persistently messy and neither my wife not myself are the studious types to keep up on it, although I've become increasingly more anal and frustrated by the fact that I am and have always lived like a slob.

As for work, my sleeping schedule is entirely inconsistent. I work a rotating schedule, switch back to a normal sleep schedule for my days off, I work a lot of holidays which I hate. Not a lot I can do about it though.

Anyways, just looking for some encourage/sympathy."
Sinking on foreign soil,3,mkbs4s,2,"My husband is struggling to keep up with my emotions....and quite frankly so am I. One minute I'm elated and going a million miles an hour and  then out of nowhere BOOM....I'm struggling to do anything and crying in the shower. I relocated out of my home country and haven't been able to see any of my family or friends for over 2 years now. I finally started settling into life here and then had to move again and everything is so overwhelming. I just cannot get out of this pit of misery. I want to be grateful for the life that I have but my mind won't let me. My husband is trying to understand but he really struggles to deal with my rollercoaster moods. It's like an endless cycle of guilt too because I feel bad for feeling like this. The good old ""people have it way worse"" guilt. Anyway, just needed to be heard....thanks for listening."
Can’t seem to find happiness in myself or other things it’s getting to me,2,mkbrik,1,I’ve had depression since I was 13 I’m now turning 19 and feel like absolutely nothing has changed in me I’ve been to hospitals I’ve taken all the medication but I still feel like life is not for me I am an extra here and I’ve started to care less and less about everyone around me which scares me sometimes I don’t know what to do anymore I hate life .
Waiting for another day to be over,8,mkbqmk,5,"Everyday it’s the same. I do what I can to pass the time, but there’s nothing I really want to be doing or enjoy doing. Nothing brings me pleasure. So each day I wait for it to be bedtime so I can once again slip into unconsciousness for a little while only to be disappointed when I wake that it’s time to do it all again.

Can anyone relate?"
"I never really thought myself to really get depressed, but recently I just... realized how bad it was",2,mkbqln,1,"My dad has had me help him with his hobby/job and I only focused on it because it was absolute shit, but what with me turning 18 I’ve finally had time to look at myself, and I don’t know if I know what to do"
I wanna die but,1,mk7lb2,6,I don’t wanna goto hell
I know it's over,2,mkblvj,1,"My best friend of 20 years has abandoned me. She did not care about my mental health. I tried to get passed that, but she held all the cards and decided it wasn't worth it apparently. Now I'm just sad all the time. I keep thinking of what I might say to her, but I'm resisting being the first to reach out. She used to help me through my depression so much, but now she's turned her back on me."
i hate babys,2,mkbkzg,3," having children is not synonymous with being an adult, it is synonymous with being trapped in an increasingly boring life with a boring person and a sample of human who will probably throw up in your face and you will find it cute because it was the most interesting thing that happened your life"
My dog died,4,mkbkc2,4,"My dog died yesteday, and the only thing I can think of is how I will interact with people when I tell them that my dog just died.  
I don't feel anything and it scares me. My dog was my best friend for 11 years straight, he was the most kind dog I know and helped me to get through some tough times. But now he's gone, just like that. He got some kind of infection and in span of 2 days diseased, unable to walk, eat and even drink.  
I cried once when my parents took him in a big black bag (he was big lab so they couldn't get him up any other way) to the vet. I wasn't there for him, I didn't even ask where the vet was. I just felt numb and took a stroll.  
Now I'm sitting in my room and I just don't know. It feels like nothing happened and even wording it like that doesn't make me feel anything. I just thinking of all scenarious about how my friends will react and what I need to say, what face to make. Is there something wrong with me?  
And to think about all of this, is there anything or anyone that I'm afraid of losing? I just feel like an empty vessel, someone out of this world, not in a bad way nor in good.  
Feels shitty but not really  
I'm sorry, Archibald, you are the goodest boy, thank you for everything."
Eternal 52 pickup.,3,mkbgmk,5,That's all. That's how this life feels.
Outside looking in,5,mkbds5,15,"So COVID is slowly dying down a tad bit people are getting vaccines and more places are opening up. So me and some friends decided to go out and see some action of the city life. Mind you I live in Atlanta so we head downtown. We get out our cars and start walking around and it is a truly beautiful day sun is shining and lots of people walking about . But I couldn’t shake this feeling of I didn’t belong there that these people are to happy and nice. People smiling, lovers holding hands and I’m walking with my friends (who leave me behind because I was kinda people watching lol ). some place deep in my heart I felt alone, I felt like I was truly left out of something they had and I didn’t need to be there. Silly thought but I thought maybe because of how I dress but then I thought maybe it’s just me and who I am... so afterwards we head home and now I’m left with that thought. Like I’m missing something that they have or I’m a stranger looking in on someone.... 

I hope I get better..."
I feel alone even with a loving family,4,mkbc5t,11,"My parents while not perfect are great but nobody ever comes to check up on me even just to shoot a quick “hey” or “what’s up”, my favorite person in the world to talk to has started leaving me on read and now other people are on delivered or read, I’m the butt of every joke my best friends while great people to hang out with  have kind of resorted to making me the butt of the joke sometimes I don’t have a pet because I’m allergic to dogs and cats so no little pet to have as a friend nobody to go to when I’m feeling down cause I don’t want to worry anyone and I’m too scared to commit suicide because I don’t want to hurt the good people in my life"
It finally happened,37,mkbby6,13,"I got on my Xbox none of my friends were on just me, I took a look at all of my 18 games and had no urge no desire to play any of them, I feared this day would come, my depression would get the better of me, my only hobby where I don’t sit back and just stare at a screen, speaking of which I want to go fishing, I have a license, a rod ready to go but no desire to well not enough to actually get up and go out and do it.......I feel...I feel sick..its really come to this"
Just the ramblings of a lonely dude,1,mkbbfl,1,"Ok let's start from the beginning I am currently a 20 year old. I am average height and while I'm on the skinny side it's not too bad. I also make sure I am clean shaven and take showers all the time. I am in great shape there is a mountain by my house I hike up most nights. I feel like I just have to get that clear so people don't give me the wrong kind of advice.

Anyway so the farthest I've ever gotten with a girl was making out at a kickback back in like 2016. Now while I know that there is certainly more to life than relationships and I do have other hobbies like hiking and basketball at the end of the day there is only so much I can do during the day to try to prevent myself from feeling lonely and empty at the end of the day.

So this upcoming fall semester I am actually transferring out of my community college and into a real university. I got accepted to my local university but I decided to go to one that is about a 4 hour drive away from where I live now. I did this because I feel like there is nothing left for me in this city. Anyway the point is that I'll be living in college going to class compared to me living in my house doing online class. So in this new environment I'll have much more opportunities to meet girls compared to what I'm in now. I also plan to join a drama club since I do enjoy that to get myself out there as well. I do feel hopeful and I'm trying to stay positive but with this hope there is also a feeling of fear.

Firstly I fear that I just still won't have any luck with girls like it has been all my life. The main thing I fear is how girls will react to me telling them that. My plan is to not bring it up myself but if she asks I'd rather answer truthfully because I don't believe you should lie to your partner but what if she judges or thinks differently of me? Should I lie or tell the truth and would she find out when the times comes cause of me not knowing what the hell to do? People say some girls are turned on by taking a guy's virginity while other girls avoid us like the plague but I have yet to meet one of the first kind but plenty of the second. Anyway for me it doesn't matter how I lose my virginity whether that be because some girl is super drunk at a party and wants to smash me or to a girl I've formed a real connection with. I was pondering paying someone to take it for me but I convinced myself to wait until after college to do that. If it's a hookup I don't plan on saying anything before the act cause people hook up to have a good time not to coach someone. But if I actually do form a good relationship with a girl I would want to tell her beforehand but I'd still be afraid of judgement.

Last paragraph I swear. I almost feel like I'm at a crossroads in my life. There is the path where I not just get a girlfriend but make awesome friends and good connections. And then there is the path where I just can't do it for whatever kind of reason. Sometimes I see posts on here that say ""I'm 30 years old and still a virgin"" when I see those posts I just think to myself ""I would have killed myself before I even get to that point. If I'm being honest if I get to my late 20s/early 30s and I'm still a loner I'd rather just die at that point. I know that I'm still young so I don't plan on giving up yet anytime soon but I just hope I can get a girl sometime in the next few years.

Also if anyone especially the girls has any advice on how/when to tell a girl that I'm a virgin without it being awkward or bad how would I go about it? Should I say before or after the act or just not at all?

\-I know this is long but thanks to anyone who took the time to read all of this please leave anything you wanna say down below."
Opinion,4,mkb9gx,1,"I don’t feel like people who haven’t experienced depression are good at helping others with depression, tbh I feel like they only make it worse... idk not trying to start an argument but yeah..."
Absolutely fed up with working for assholes...,39,mkb8b7,15,"Anyone else getting FUCKING SICK of working for assholes for nothing? I know I am. How many of you were told before getting out of school that you’re going to have a blast starting your own journey and going through life? How many of you now realize that even the profession of the teachers that got you through school doesn’t even pay enough for people to life a good and happy life.

I went to college for a bullshit trade that I basically have to travel for if I want a job because the economy in my town is garbage, and all the businesses around here would rather hire friends and cousins and family of other employees, so finding a new job is a goddamn endless nightmare, just to get another bullshit job you hate.

Plenty of people will think or say “it’s not that bad, plenty of people have it worse than you”, or “oh suck it up, that’s how life is”, or my favorite “just write up a resume and look for something you like.” Everyone knows all this shit, it’s all preached by most parents starting by the age of 12.

I literally wake up for my soul crushing night shift and my first thought is “I have to do this or shit like it for 40-45 more years” and it brings me to fucking tears. The thought of dragging my ass out to my car and going to work for some rich asshole that would have me replaced fully within a week if I died tomorrow actually makes me physically ill. Back when my parents worked, you could find a job doing basically anything and be making decent money, or get into a field of work that today you would need a 2 year school course. Now you have to cough up 20k just to go to school for a chance at getting a job in that field afterwards. And guess what? YOULL HATE THAT JOB TOO.

It’s gotten to the point for me where sometimes I think the only way to get out of this godforsaken cycle of torture is to kill yourself or come across an absolutely monstrous amount of money. I have no idea how to deal with this anger and frustration, and I take it out of the people I love and care about. Can’t take a vacation because my job doesn’t do things legally and we barely get our scheduled days off as it is. Can’t look for a new job because I speak English in a mostly bilingual are where most of the good, high paying jobs are bilingual only. Like I just feel trapped. Anyone else out there feeling the same way?"
I really don't like the twenty first century; constantly living in a state of nostalgia,4,mkb7ol,4,"While my childhood and teenage years weren't great, in which I was  bullied by my peers, I still relatively had a good childhood. When I wasn't having to deal with schoolyard torments, I escaped to a world of nerd culture, and had hopes and dreams for my life as an adult in which things would be better.

In the past decade or so I've been finding myself reflecting on my childhood growing up in the 1980's quite often, and daydream about how great life was for me, especially waking up on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons, eat cereal and play with my action figures, summer vacations and just having no adult responsibilities.

About a month ago I came across a box filled with videotapes, and started going through them. They were filled with television shows I had recorded throughout the 1990's, the height of my teenage years. Watching those videos has made me feel both nostalgic and extremely depressed in the past few weeks. They're from a time when I had so much hope and optimism, when I thought I would make something of myself as an adult. I also see things like the commercials of that era, or even late night talk shows, and it made me realize how much I dislike our current culture in comparison to the one I grew up with. I'm now constantly living in a state of ""I wish we could go back to that way of life"", and I find myself scrambling trying to find more programming of that era, or tuning into music from that time period. Then I hear a song from 1996, something I probably haven't heard since then, and I feel sick to my stomach like I want to throw up. I like the song, but it makes me incredibly sad for the fact I never got to experience life like most other teenagers did, and things didn't get better as I got older.

I've got a whole set of problems as it is (my post history will show that), but in the last few weeks I feel so incredibly lost and longing for a time that I know I can never get back. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis of some kind, but I don't know what to do about it. All I want to do is sleep and keep watching, listening and reading content from my childhood and teenage years, and wishing I could go back. This is not healthy, and I think I need some kind of help.

EDIT I've also been drinking alcohol a lot more lately."
Just now realizing how I was sexually assaulted and forced into a relationship for 2 years,4,mkb4x0,2,"College age male here. I have finally cut a certain toxic person out of my life, and finally the weight of fear and terror I got at every call and every conversation is gone, but now that I've had months to myself I have been able to realize what happened for real.

It started as cuddling, innocent enough, and frankly the sexual contact that started ensuing was definitely wanted by me. At the time it was a FWB relationship -- no romance. However, my first kiss with her, which happened not long into it, was not wanted by me. I did it to satisfy her, and I still remember how catatonic I was during that first kiss -- she even said how awful it was, because I went into complete panic mode, couldn't move at all. First time having real sex was the same -- I didn't really want it yet, I'd expressed that her, but she guilted me into trying 3 times to have sex. I say trying because the first 2 times, my dick wouldn't even get hard due to the anxiety. I wasn't ready for that, it was my first experience of any kind, and it was progressing too fast. Didn't even like her like that.

Feels like none of this even is valid since I willingly made out with her and had sex with her after that though, like, I shouldn't be complaining about it.

I didn't even really want to be in a relationship with her but both my and her mental illness didn't help here. I needed validation and was getting it. The abusive nature of the relationship turned emotional after that. Don't need to get into the yelling, the gaslighting, the everything. It never felt right because I would go to bed feeling even worse every single day but I craved the affection and companionship so much that I stayed. But god, I'm a wreck now, even more than I was before all of this. First really bad depressive episode in a long time today, when I thought I'd gotten better. Gained over 20 pounds in the last couple months. I'm unconvinced anyone desires or wants me, physically or otherwise. I'll never be able to find a relationship worth getting into for me even though I want one. I've been permanently ruined and handcuffed to someone who stunted my growth emotionally during formative years of young adulthood. I just want to break down and cry."
My mind is so cloudy lately,3,mkb3m9,1,"I’m having trouble remembering a lot of things. Think I didn’t take my meds today, and didn’t want to risk doubling my dose. Anyways I’ve felt euphoric all day. Felt really happy looking at the sky, spending time with a friend lately, where I am in life. It came crashing down fast though. Every night it’s always the worst of thoughts in my head really. Really nothing nice or nothing that makes me happy lasts in life I know all of this is going to end, it has before and I’ll be left feeling so empty again. 

I don’t know why I keep writing these posts even but there is a small comfort in yelling into the void like this for nobody to see."
"I Think ""I Don't Want To Be Alive Anymore"" Multiple Times A Day",2,mkb2rm,2,"I don't know why I'm bothering. I told my doctor and therapist I keep having these thoughts. It's frustrating because my depression wasn't always like this. I want off my medication. Off this fucked up thinking. Off the depression. Just let me go. 

I don't want to die but I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm tired of this pain. I'm tired of everyone and everything. Nothing has meaning. I have no joy, nothing to look forward to. Money means nothing. 

I'm happiest when I'm asleep. Once I wake up and realise who I am, that's when the depression hits. Why can't I just sleep forever? Why can't I just sleep at least 24 hours? Just let me dream. Let me enjoy the characters in my head. Just drift away. Some place better.

And what happens when covid is over? I go back to working in an office I hate? Driving an hour in traffic, working a job I hate only to go to bed and do it over again 5 days a week. Then on the weekend because I'm so exhausted with humans I just spend time away from people and relax. Until the Sunday scaries come back and ruin me. At least this pandemic has given me more time to be happy. I never want to go back to ""normal"". 

I just want to be happy but every attempt I make brings me a step closer to fucking depression. How the fuck does medication + therapy give you the opposite reaction? This is like giving chemo for cancer but the cancer grows stronger. I wish I never tried to think I could rid of you depression. I was better before I tried. Better before I could think about a time of what the fuck even is happy. I deserve to be dead. 

Feeling hurts. My skin is so sensitive. Every touch feels meaningless.

I never experience good. I only experience bad or nothing. But hey at least the medication and therapy are going to trick my brain into thinking it's all right! 

Please just end the pain. Heal me of this depression. It's been a decade. Just please. Let me go. Let me go depression. Let me ..."
Depression Relapse - Needing Help,3,mkb1rt,2,"Hi All

I'm having the first proper relapse into my depression for about a year. In essence, a break-up is the closest reason for this but it's made me reflect on everything else and it's just spiralling out of control a bit.

Of course there are good days, but most days I just feel this indescribable weight on my shoulders that I just can't escape from. I've always been a high-functioning depressed person but it's honestly getting harder and harder to get up out of bed or do anything anymore. I'm sorta losing joy in the things I used to enjoy doing and its harder to get these incredibly mean, self-biting thoughts out of my head. 

I just feel super lonely and inadequate. I'm on the verge of tears most days and it's honestly getting harder to just cope day-to-day. 
I'm starting to think that maybe just being depressed and melancholy is a part of my personality, but I don't know anymore.

I'm not suicidal (I was about 2 years ago but I've dealt with that comprehensively), so there's always a bright side, I guess. 

I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to cope. I'm still seeing my psych but I would really appreciate any additional advice if people have them :)"
Help?,1,mkayh6,3,"How do I explain my parents that my suicidal thoughts and phone are NOT connected in any way, because I told them I felt sad, and they hid my phone from me!?! 😂😂😂"
in the middle of work and i really feel like breaking down,5,mkay5h,3,all i want is to kill myself and disappear from this world without feeling guilty about leaving broken-hearted people behind.
Stalled out and can’t take steps to move forward,2,mkavug,0,"I’m broke and unemploymed. Every action (applying for jobs, selling things on eBay ...) just doesn’t happen. I haven’t talked to anyone since Jan. I am in zero contact just 1 or 2 text a week.  I am getting phobic about interacting with anyone.

I’m not actually suicidal,but feel like I am trapped in amber.

I have meds that are anxious, so not helping. I am in the us so can’t afford a dr.

I’m older, and there is no purpose to my life.

I just need some help with baby sites to move me forward. There not really anyone I can go to for support."
Feeling numb/nothingness,10,mkaqz2,3,"When I used to get depressed I found myself being really emotional and have breakdowns fairly often. Ever since the pandemic started it felt like I started to lose my emotions to the point where I feel numb. There is such a strange feeling in my head like this pressurized cloud preventing me from feeling anything or thinking properly. I used to be able to express myself more back then so coping was not as difficult but now it's like this battle in my head if what I'm feeling is valid. The battle in my head makes me just stay quiet because I feel like my thoughts/ feelings aren't worth talking about. I'm also lost with life and what I want to do, I'm a new uni grad (24 M) and it's difficult to find my place in this world during the pandemic. My parents rely on me a lot so I feel this pressure that I need to have things figured out and contribute to helping my family... especially right now when I'm sure everyone is dealing with financial and mental health issues. But not having things figured out or doing anything due to what's going on in the world really aggravates me. 

I'm not even sure why I'm typing this out and I'm not really looking for answers,  I guess it would just be nice to see if someone feels the same and see if typing it out makes me feel better. 
Thank you for reading."
i can't imagine going through another day yet here i am again,2,mkap5a,3,seriously my mind is a mess. i know im not going anywhere but yet i can't even begin to think of a future. the thought of being alive for another month or week is so beyond me. yet here i am.
I was doing ok until..,1,mkap4a,1,"I am a 32m and i have been divorced for 5 years. I was doing ok trying to get over what was an abusive toxic relationship that started when i was 19.

Ive been working through things step by step for years. But recently met my parents and went for a walk through a nearby park to catch up as ive not been able to meet them theough fear of covid. I work in retail and there is little to no protection for me. I saw my ex wife with her current partner on said walk. Ive been being ""strong"" and not letting it get the better of me. But when i saw her the extent of how she broke me down came flooding back to me and i dont know what to do. Its 3am and just off the phone to my mum. I know that in the grand scheme of things my issues are small. Ive been to support groups/cbt groups and my issues are minor compared to some of the people whove attended them, it makes me massively unwilling to share how i feel in these groups.

I have suicidal thoughts daily, and the anti depression meds stopped helping and started basically holding me in place. I dont know what to do or where to turn. But i feel like after a decade im losing this fight."
I wish I cared,1,mkamxn,5,"Friends, school, hobbies. All meaningless to me now. My life is falling apart. I really wished I cared enough to pull myself back together. But everything feels so empty man. I can’t see the reason to if it’s all going to end."
"I’m not really sad, I’m just alone, and being alone is making me sad",3,mkameg,5,"I don’t even know how to describe how I’m feeling. 

I really just want someone who I can get in the car and go for a ride with. I want someone who I can just lay there and talk to and not feel like I’m really bothering them, but I haven’t had that for a long time and it’s getting draining. 

I recently turned 18 and it’s made me realize that I’m not going to be a teenager soon, I’m officially an adult and I don’t have a single irl friend. I don’t see people one on one anymore, and haven’t in over 3 months. 

I guess I’m more lonely then depressed, but I just want someone irl, I just don’t know how to interact. There aren’t clubs near me. I’m not in school, I can’t keep a job due to anxiety issues. 

I’m just exhausted of being alone."
suicide,1,mkalex,3,"do u ever feel like killing yourself but ur still afraid of what might happen afterwards, what truly happens after you die, im not religious and i have no idea what death could be like, but i dont like being alive and im scared"
Worst thing about feeling better is realizing your spouse is no longer interesting,2,mkafcm,10,"She is gentle, she is caring, she is loving. She stands beside me time and time again when things are bad. I like spending time with her. I like hugging her, kissing her, loving her. But life has become dreadfully boring. TV, movies and books. Or she does her arts and crafts. I want to get out and do adventurous things. Outdoors stuff, nature stuff. Climbing and hiking and go carts. Excitement, daring. I want to learn sports shooting. I want to go off roading, axe throwing. I look at other women our age, other wives our age and they do fun stuff. Sure I could do all those things myself but I would rather do them with my wife, my life partner. So each time I get feeling better I only get feeling worse."

Depressed About Ex of 12 Years Having Baby,2,mkaei9,1,"Some background about me:

I’ve only had one girlfriend in my life and we dated for 7 months while I was in college 12 years ago. She dumped me and it was horrible but eventually I started dating again and began to get over her, or so I thought.

Flash forward to about a month ago when I found out that she and her husband had a baby and for some reason it just killed me emotionally. 

I’ve been anxious and depressed ever since. Is this an understandable reaction to anyone? What can I do to move past this? I haven’t been this depressed since we actually broke up in 2009."
"Depression has robbed me of everything. Friends, family, my career.",3,mkacmh,2,"My depression has always been there but has worsened over the past 7 years and throughout that time I’ve lost everyone except my poor long-suffering partner. I can barely get myself out of bed (and god forbid to shower) - let alone nurture relationships. It’s meant I’ve had to drop out of medical school.

My partner would be so happy without me, all I cause him is misery and I hate myself beyond compare for this. He is such a wonderful, kind and generous soul - he deserves so much better, he deserves the world. The best person I’ve ever met. Anyone else would have run miles years and years ago, but he’s too kind for his own good. I don’t deserve him. Everyday I think about how me leaving this world would be the best thing for him.

I hit rock bottom a very long time ago and I don’t know how much longer I can stay here.

Today makes me what to give up,1,mkaa07,1,"I feel like no matter what I do in my life I’m always a failure. I can’t say the right things, everything that comes out of my mouth sounds passive aggressive and blunt because I don’t see the point in faking niceties, and maybe the depression has removed the filter between my brain and mouth. Nothing I ever do is right, my fucking mother wants me to get out and hang out with more people yet lectures me about how online dating is unsafe. I don’t have the energy to try and do my school work. I just feel like a complete waist of space. I just got lectured about how I’m going to kill someone because apparently getting a flat tire and not wanting to tell my narcmother the story makes me a bad driver. I just feel like disappearing into nothingness so I don’t have to deal with my life anymore. I try so hard to be better everyday, and it feels pointless. I’m trying to do everything I’m supposed to to get better and it feels like it doesn’t matter."
With no energy anymore...,1,mka8fo,1,"From my teenager years (probably way back) I've been diagnostic with depression I'm 24 now, and it's only getting the worst. I don't know if I can't explain to it that much into words but, that feeling of being trash, not being able to do anything. Like have a job, friends, go out (not in these times though). And looking at my cousins which have the same age as me being way better at their lives, while I'm here suffering thinking of killing my self every day. While my whole family thinks that I'm some kind of parasite that it is only taking money from my mother while my family is drowning in debts because of me and the amount of meds I need to take(that doesn't work at all) or my suicide attempts. Everything is filling my head so much that I feel I'm going to explode so much, and I can't stand no longer seeing my mother suffer because of this with the piles and piles of bill that she needs to pay with her low retired salary. I really want to help her get out of this trumpeter fire and at least make a life better for her, but I just CAN'T. I'm so weak, can't do shit, can't work, and it's just making expensive while my whole family and sisters points their fingers at me saying how bad of a person I'm. It hurts so much that maybe killing myself will end it. They won't need to pay those expensive bills and medication for me that doesn't work and won't need to reliable on a shit ass son that was a failure from the moment it was born.

Help,2,mka2gc,0,"I’m borderline homicidal and suicidal, every time I “accidentally” hurt my dogs I grab a knife and start cutting my chest so no one will be able to tell I self-harm. My dogs are literally the only thing in this entire world I care about and yet I hurt them and after it happens all I care about is death. I start banging my head against the wall and crying uncontrollably and the worst part about is my dog consoles me after. Even when I’m not depressed all I think about suicide or some form of death and or homicide to pass the time. I don’t care about taking any sort of medication or going to therapy I just need someone to tell me how to end is instantly I would prefer no pain whatsoever but pain is acceptable as long as it’s instantaneous."
I wish I could look towards the future again,2,mk9x0x,2,"This year has been a train wreck. My mental health is in the absolute worst state it’s ever been. I even attempted suicide. I honestly wonder why I’m still here. Everyday is just a struggle of trying to feel okay. Even slight inconveniences feels like less of a reason to live. 

Before, I always had goals to work towards that kept me somewhat sane. Now I have no goals. No relationship goals because me and my partner are rocky to say the least. We’re in a bit of a better spot now and I want to trust him, but I can’t help but fear I’ll end up hurt for the millionth time. My partner also fears the future and we both want different things. I want to work towards living together and more down the line and I worry he doesn’t want that any time soon. 

I also have no job goals because I put all of my eggs into one basket like an idiot and got turned down from my dream opportunity, and now I have no fall back plan. I have no moving goals as I don’t want to live with my parents (they’re abusive) but also not in my partners parents house because I feel like I’ll only cramp the place up. I have no future goals at all. 

As I said, I survive day by day, yet graduation from college and adulthood inches closer. And now, everyone, even relatives like uncles and grandparents, are pressuring me to figure it out. No matter what, I’ll probably lose and further lose my grip on sanity."

Advice on cutting myself and being misogynistic.,0,mk9pxd,3,"Hey guys. For some context I'm a 13 year old boy and I have only told one freind that I think I have depresion. I understand that literally everyone at my age feel as though the world is falling apart, but for me its because I'm here. I feel like I'm a burden. I've thought about killing myself and think about death at least 6-7 times a day. I've realized that I'm too chicken to actually kill myself but I've started to cut myself in the arms to relive the pressure and anxiety. I dont want loads of scars but I can't get away from me feeling like a burden. I feel like a burden because i am constantly told that i am a man so that means i could be a rapist, that all men are misogynistic, and that i should die for women.. these dumb things have taken a toll on my metal health. Any advice on how to stop cutting and actually feel decent?"
Has depression affected you more as you get older?,2,mk9p6d,1,"I'm 35 now and it's been like this basically nonstop since I was 13. I felt like I had reasons to be sad when I was in my 20s; shit job, few if any friends, rarely had a relationship that lasted very long, and my future looked pretty bleak in general. Now I'm married, own a home, much better job, all of the standard adult things people would expect of a man my age but I feel worse as a result. My life is objectively better but I still have these stretches of days or weeks where I really struggle. I always told myself that things would fix me; someone who loved me, a better job, not renting apartments or riding buses anymore and as a result, I felt somewhat in control of my emotions. I had convinced myself that I was sad because my life sucked basically. Now that it's clear none of those things made any difference, I realize how helpless I am and those episodes of feeling said, worthless, and withdrawing last longer and are harder to get out of. Does anyone else feel like they're sinking lower and lower as they get older?"
I just want to tell you it can get better,18,mk9p1e,1,"I spent most of my teens and 20s suffering from severe depression (along with anxiety and a variety of other ills). I never thought it could get better, because experience had shown me otherwise. I was in the dark for so long, I really thought I'd be dead before 30. 

Well, my 30th birthday is in about 6 months, and I just want to tell you there *is* hope. Even if you don't feel it right now--even if you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel right now--it is there. Today, a song from high school came on in the shower and I cried, thinking about how far I've come since then. I've spent many years in therapy, and take multiple medications. There is no shame in seeking help. I no longer constantly want to die. I really thought I always would.

I'll never say I have it all figured out, but I definitely have it *more* figured out than I did. It is possible to get better. It is possible to learn how to tolerate your life, and yourself. **You have worth, you deserve good things--love, friendship, accomplishment, moments of peace. Don't deprive yourself of them because you don't feel good enough. Try to be kind to yourself, even when the depression tells you not to be. Have compassion for your suffering, and forgive your mistakes. You're just an imperfect human like the rest of us. It's going to be ok** <3"
My boyfriend is so optimistic it makes me nauseous? Ik it's fucked up..,0,mk9ow2,5,"This is a rent/vent post so feel free to just skip it ❤️

So basically I have been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember. I tried pretty much every healthy and unhealthy coping mechanism there is and let's say my mental health has never really improved that much, the last year especially has been hell, I even got back some old bad habits that I really shouldn't have.. My best friend and boyfriend of two years, on the other hand, has always been very well mental health-wise (thank god!) which I of course really appreciate, since that allows him to be a very happy and fun person. 

Since the beginning of last year, though, which is exactly when I started getting worse again, he started posting all of these inspirational and motivational quotes on all of his social media. For engagement and networking purposes, ya know.

He still keeps posting these. Constantly writing about how life is great and he loves everything and he loves working and you can do anything if you try hard enough and such- and I have grown to really hate that. I feel so bad for saying or even thinking this. 

It's not like I WANT to have a pessimistic outlook on life- but you know, depression kinda does that. 
He doesn't get mental illnesses at all. He doesn't understand how it works, the feelings, the triggers-which I don't blame him for! It's hard to understand depression when you've never suffered from it.
But I just can't stand all those optimistic things he posts. I mean he kinda knows how much I'm struggling. And it's not like I don't want him to post what he wants, or to be optimistic-- it's just that, as bad as it sounds, I'm kind of starting to hate him for being so carefree and saying shallow things like ""willpower is everything, if you want to, you can"". Like bitch, no, that's not how it works for everyone, I can't do jack if I'm having an episode, it's not that easy!
I love him to death and I don't want to hurt him or talk about it with him, because I know I don't have any right to do so, since he really enjoys posting inspirational stuff. But I don't know how to cope. Everytime he asks me what I think I just have to say it's great, but inside I'm falling apart because it just all seems so FAKE to me. I hope that makes sense to someone."
How to feel like myself again?,2,mk9nre,2,"I am quite new to reddit and apologise if i break any rules or anything. Id like to start off by saying I used to have depression and I turned my life around and fixed it, I was confident, got good grades, independently happy with the support of my friends and family, I started dating a guy (same age as I am) for a year and a half now. But since world events happened and I am doing online school, nothing feels the same, I'm depressed again, no longer the person I once was, failing all my classes, feel like a disappointment and I have no clue where to go or what to do. I am on a waiting list for a therapist and I don't know how to talk about these things as I don't want people to look at me differently, along top of all these problems genetic health issues are showing up and its just bringing me down more. I have considering not living, but I know its not my time to go as I want to help save more lives. I have no where to go and no one to talk to, any help or comments will be appreciated, thank you."
My will to live is gone,1,mk9hy0,2,"

I don’t really know how to word what I feel but I just lost my will to live.  Like if someone were to come up to me and point a gun at my head and threaten to shoot me, I wouldn’t be scared.  In fact, I might even provoke them intentionally to fire.  I’m 16 and I already feel like my “good years” or whatever people say about childhood is over.  Ever since I was about 11, I just have always felt different you know.  Now it’s not cause there is something different about me but because on an intellectual level I think different.  I don’t know if it’s because I am a lot more mature than people my age but I just can’t connect with most people my age.  On top of that, I’ve had some dramatic experiences as a young kid that still traumatize me deeply to this day.  I have severe anxiety and stress in my life as well and it all revolves around school.  I fucking hate school.  Teachers and counselors say they are “always there for you” but in the end all they do is put more stress onto you.  When I am with the few friends I have I feel normal and I am actually happy.  Immediately when I get to be along with myself at night or alone with myself in general its almost as if I am viewing my life from a. Third person point of view, idk how to explain it.  When I am with myself thinking at night, images and memories about every little thing that I regret doing and also traumatic experiences I had in the past pop up in my head and it’s almost as if my head is forcing me to relive the horrors of my past.  On top of this, I already can see the life that is paving out for me.  Nothing in life so far is going in the direction I want it to go and I can already see me in 15-20 years on a couch smoking and drinking my pain away or I might not even be around.  People say that there is so much to live for but that just not true.  Everything in life that I thought would cheer me up and make me happy hasn’t. I sit in bed each night and just relive my past or just sit there crying through the night. I hate my family as well.  It’s not because they don’t take care of me or do anything for me (they do so fucking much for me), but it’s because I hate myself for how I treat them.  I’m a quiet person and I keep to myself. I have trust issues and anything that anyone says to me or anything that some does that angers or hurts me I just keep it inside.  I bury all the shit that has been said to me and all my thoughts deep down, and I release everything behind closed doors on my family.  They don’t deserve me and I don’t deserve them.  They almost tell me what a bad person I am and why everyone says I am the kindest person they know but I treat them so shitty and all I can say is “idk” because they will never understand why.  People say try therapy but no therapist has ever worked.  They treat me like any other person giving the same old responses I hear over and over again.  “Write down your thoughts” “I’m here for you” “try breathing exercises”.  The same damn shit over and over again.  The thing is I’m not like others, and those “techniques” that they say work don’t.  I’m 16 now, and after 5 years of depression and  anxiety, I can officially say I’ve given up. What I mean by that is I’ve given up hope that things will get better.  I’ve given up hope on me.  I’ve given up hope on my future.  I’m just done.  I’ve lost the will to live.  I just feel empty all the damn time.  I’m never really happy, I just put a smile on my face to hide my pain and sadness from the rest of the world.  I’m too much of a pussy to end my life, but if I was ever threatened with death, I would be scared.  Sorry if this post doesn’t make any sense but I just had to put my thoughts to words yaknow."

How do you learn to live with MDD?,1,mk9hd4,1,"I've had severe MDD and GAD my whole life, and I often feel like it takes over everything that I do. I rarely have the energy to get out of bed, I just cut off a good fraction of my friends, hardly speak to my family/friends, and haven't left the house in literal days. I work from home and get my groceries delivered, and quite honestly it is hard for me to not drink/smoke weed every day. I got back on antidepressants, but honestly I don't notice much of a difference with them than I do without them. I just feel really alone but I don't want to be around anyone, either.

But my situation got worse over time. One day I even cut myself. My doctor told me my idea of moral and my emotions are in battle. I started to consume alcohol more. He came to my house every night . One night I became very bad. I couldn’t even talk or open my eyes to his words. He shout me “be better!!!!don’t do this to me” when he started crying I would always hug him tell him” I love you. “ and he would stop crying. This day when I did this he hit my arm. And left. Next day when I asked him very simple question about air he didn’t even bother to answer me. Time passed. My friends were curious and sad about me. One of them text him. He told her “ I have nothing to do. tell her parents. She is so bad” my heart is broken apart. I tried to kill myself but couldn’t. I think about my parents. I lost myself. I live like a grass. I do nothing. Just crying a lot. I am a educated Person who have a nice job, I travel a lot but it doesn’t help either. I m not ugly actually most men want to be with me who are way more better than him. I also have money too. But no. I just can’t. I’m traumatized. People keep asking me “what is your problem?” I can not explain them. But my heart hurts. It really hurts. I don’t think I can trust or love anyone again. My therapist told me I am very depressed.

How do you handle mood swings ?,1,mk9edx,0,"Hello there,

I have no idea if I'm in the right place. I used to be depressive tho I never was diagnosed it. I thought things were getting better but I can't manage my mood swings. I thought they were cause by the very dire situation i was in. Now that I reached some stability and that nothing or no one threat me I thought I should be just fine and grateful but I don't feel any better. 
Everything feels faded as if they were no real joy no real depth nothing to get me out of this sleep. 
The only strong feeling left is anger and sadness I can't control them. 
Today was a perfect day I should be so happy but I'm not I'm just crying it's been 5 hours and it just don't pass. I can't stop it. 
Nothing bad happen yet I'm thinking I should end this miserable being i am. I know I won't do anything this stupid but my mind is telling me I'm just a failure that I don't deserve to breathe. It just can't stop. 
I use to take whatever can bring me to sleep when I feel that way. Eventually the next morning I will feel better. I know this is not a solution. But I haven't any. 
I'm so scared, that the only person I love think that all of this is just an act that I'm just pretending. I'm thinking about no seeing my boyfriend untill it settles but it's never better. 
I tried seeing therapist but it just left me feeling even more helpless. I don't know I felt like I needed someone to tell me everything was normal that I was just sick. I wanted to hear that. If it was a sickness it could heal but it seems I'm the very issue. All those appointments make me feel like I deserve all the bad things that happen to me and that I should just end this. I felt like I couldn't bear therapy anymore if it made me feel that way. 
But I guess I need help at least to stop having those angry crises and sad ones. I can let myself fall and take some pills and just sleep ( like a real sleep nothing morbid here )  It won't ever fix anything. 
Do you guys know anyway to keep those moods down ? Or any tricks to handle them when they happen ?"
I really wish I surrounded myself with better role models/friends when I was in my late teens/early twenties.,4,mk9e02,3,"I feel like a lot of my self loathing tendencies that come with depression wouldn’t be as bad as they are today if I surrounded myself with better people. I had it pretty rough growing up which I won’t get into, but the friends I made and people I surrounded myself with in my early adulthood created a framework for my identity that stuck with me for a long time. By this I mean I hung out with older people who went to bars constantly and sexual assault was common due to alcohol inebriation and the girls I hung out with were always craving male attention, whether it be good or bad. I also worked in the restaurant industry for many years which can be pretty toxic. When you surround yourself with people who don’t treat themselves well, it drains you too. I wish I knew this when I was younger."

It makes me yearn for the opportunity to go back in time and undo all of the bad choices I make. Either that or to be reborn as a new person so that I can avoid making those mistakes again. I'm just tired of trying to make this life work when it just too late for that. I've ruined this life to the point of no return and nothing I do now can change that.  I dread my birthday now as it's just another reminder of how badly I've failed at life."
Finally cleaned my house after 3 months and I feel worse about it,1,mk8rbq,0,"I feel like it’ll never get to like it was. I  had quit weed and started waking up 5 minutes before work started and showering on lunch (everyday since January 21) and laying on the couch all day any other time. My poor cats litter was only getting cleaned bi weekly and I feel awful. It’s in my bedroom so it smells terrible in there.   

I ended up just ordering a new litter box of the same kind and new bed sheets and comforter. I  had loads of Christmas gifts on the floor from months back I  literally just pitched cause I didnt know what to do with them and I feel Garbo about that.  

There’s so much cat hair and dust and dirt everywhere I feel like it’ll never be clean in here.   

Next weekend I’m going to spend all day working at it but I feel so much worse about jt now. Now I am convinced it’ll always be dirty and gross in here no matter what.   

Just venting I Guess. Now i have 2 hours to telex before bed and then 40 hours of 2000 phone calls coming up whichll make my depression worse can’t fucking wait."
It's Been a Tough Day,1,mk8ojs,0,"Hi friends,

I have suffered on and off with depression for many year and particularly this last year ( I'm sure you can gather why ). I often feel a lot of self loathing and feeling like no one will ever want to be my friend. 
Today my dog had an incident where they bit another dog that came running at them. My dog was on a lead but they grabbed the other dog by the lip and would not let go. This obviously caused a lot of stress on both sides. After the incident the other party has threatened me and said they will come to my home if I don't pay their vet bills in 24 hours.
Anyway, I just can't stop thinking about how I could have done so many things better or differently. I just feel like a useless trash heap. I'm also very scared of my dog being taken away. They are just very protective which is why we keep them away from other dogs and on a lead.

There's no real end to this, I just need to put it out there.

P.s. I have called the police about the threats so hopefully we will be safe."
Married to depression,6,mk8n91,3,"First off I love my wife. She has battled depression her whole life. We’ve been married almost 9 years. However, her mental illness is beginning to negatively affect me. I don’t know how much longer I can hang on. I don’t know how to talk to her about it because that would just make her even more depressed knowing that her depression is taking a toll on me. How have those in my position dealt with with this? What is the way forward from here?"
Losing all Motivation on an instant,1,mk8kgi,0,"hey I wanted to know if some of you had similar problems:

today was an okay day and this evening i got really hyped, i thought id start doing stuff now, buy new clothes, skin care, do some workouts and was really excited to start my ""glowup"" but then suddenly after thinking of an event that recently happened that i think about a lot : a meetup where i was really down and wasnt feeling any energy (including alcohol )which gave me one of the worst days of my life (private things happened at that meetup which didnt make me feel good ) I instantly changed from extremely hyped to extremely depressed it was crazy how fast the mood changed and now Im not even convinced of my ""glowup"" anymore even though it would really help me and my appearance. why does stuff like this happen and how can you regain your motivation again? thanks alot"
Depression - Thoughts on “You should reach out to someone”,1,mk8hrh,1,"This is my first post on Reddit. I’m using this platform due to the anonymity I can have while talking about this, which I wouldn’t have the ability to have with anyone in my personal life. That might be a spoiler for my take on the topic. 

What is Reddit’s thoughts on reaching out to people during a depressive episode for help? I don’t want to get this post to have any kind of unwelcome attention from Reddit, so I’m going to try to tread gently around the topic and use some vague language in this next part. I’ve had negative thoughts against myself, I don’t like me sometimes, and I’ve come up with plans to deal with that fact. I’ve never acted on those plans, but because I know myself I can’t do certain things since I know they’ll result in me executing said plans. Do you get what I mean?

Anyway, I’ve talked to friends about all of this before. Initially, I always get a very receptive response, and sometimes that even lasts, but sometimes it becomes clear that the person I’m talking to is getting tired that I can’t deal with my problems anymore, and I’ll no longer feel welcome talking to that person. When the receptive response lasts, the receptive person will walk on eggshells around me for months, even years, afterword. It makes me feel weird and coddled when I just want to be treated normally. I appreciate the sympathy, but I don’t always need it and I definitely don’t want them always thinking about my issues. I also don’t want them to feel responsible for my life if I ever fail to keep it together.

Does anyone else ever feel this way? I have more to say, but I’ve written too much already."
"Tired of depression, don't know what I should do next",2,mk8h0m,0,"I feel like I've been working my way towards deciding if life is worth living or not, and I'm getting closer and closer to answering that question in the negative. 

I'm almost 30 years old. I have no friends and have really never had friends. I had one really good summer a couple of years ago, but life just gets in the way. I am busy with work, or covid, or taking care of elderly dying family members. Now I'm just scared to try, but I am lonely. 

I'm really ugly too, and I feel I will never have a relationship. I'm still a virgin. Girls really liked me in my teens, but I was too hesitant to take things further. Then I got really ugly in my mid-twenties. My teeth started to get really crooked. I'm balding and it doesn't suit me. I got fat, up to 240ish (I'm 6'), then lost down to about 190, but I'm still chubby with slight gynecomastia. I hoped I would be attractive again like when I was 18, but I'm not. My neck is weirdly fat and my jaw seems to have changed so I have an underbite. My ears were always asymmetrical but the baldness makes them stand out. I even get shit tested/made fun of by some guys at work. I can tell people are treating me differently because of the way I look. I don't think a romantic relationship could happen at this point. 

I went back to school and did really well to get a STEM degree. I am just graduating now, and I think I was treated differently during some job interviews because of the way I look. Nothing really bad, but you are just kinda invisible. People don't care about you, and then someone else gets the job. But now I have worked a couple of jobs, and I have an engineering degree, and I'm employed, and I just don't care. I don't like it. I don't think I will ever like working. My job is difficult and stressful and I want to leave even though I just started. I feel all I do is work and feel lonely. I go hiking, biking, and traveling, and I have hobbies, but I do it all alone. 

I went to therapy from last December through March because I was crying every day and I wanted to kill myself. I stopped therapy because the therapist wasn't that great. 

This isn't just a mood. This is a decade-long decline. Things are only going to get worse and I get older and uglier and my body gets sore. I already suffer from knee, back, jaw, and shoulder pain. I don't sleep well due to anxiety. Life just isn't fun. I don't think it's really worth it. 

But I'm all for any advice. I'm thinking about therapy again, but I dunno. All the therapists around here seem weird and a lot are into woo stuff that I don't really buy into. I feel I can't be helped, and I don't know how to help myself. 

I don't have dysphoria. Things really are bad. I am unattractive, and I will be alone. I feel if I could accept this, my quality of life might improve, but the limitations of my life are brutal, and I don't know where to start."
I don't know what to do anymore.,1,mk8e59,0,"Life just doesn't make sense. I've spent the last year in and out of therapy and even being hospitalized at one time but it doesn't get better. I've taken my ""happy pills"" but I'm still as depressed as ever. Everyone just tells me to get over it but I cant and I dont know how to explain it to them. 

Last June I almost took my life and ended up spending a month in a mental rehabilitation center because of it. I lost my job while I was gone because I ""no-called no-showed"" and I haven't been able to find work since. I've done 10+ interviews but I can't ever get a call back. 

Today is Easter and my ex wouldn't even let me see my son and to add insult to injury I got a letter telling me they opened a case against me for unpaid child support. I've paid child support every week I had a job and carried excellent health insurance for my son but the state doesn't care that I'm unemployed, I'm still expected to make my payments. 

I want to die. I've wanted to die for years but I don't think I could ever do anything. Everyone tells me it gets better but when!? When does it get better? I grew up with a deadbeat dad and maybe it would be better if I didnt even exist, my son is young enough that he wouldn't know and maybe he would live a happy life thinking his stepdad is his real dad."
Career success stories with chronic pain and mental illness?,3,mk8dp8,0,"I'm a 22 year old that has lived with severe mental health problems since I was a kid and then developed chronic pain and fatigue issues as a teen. I have chronic pain in both arms that makes anything involving my hands/arms painful, especially repetitive movements. I have to take frequent breaks with whatever I'm doing before the pain/fatigue gets too much. If they get out of hand then it triggers pain flares and depressive and dissociative episodes. All the fun stuff.

So essentially the ideal work environment would be somewhere quiet (preferably at home), self paced, and part time. I'd like to actually work towards a career, not just jobs to get by, you know? I love art, nature, food, and animals. It took me 5 years just to get an associates in Psychology because I had so many set backs. By the end of it I was so burnt out and my mental health so bad that I didn't feel like pursuing my Bachelor's in that field. I love school and learning but I've had to drop classes almost every semester because of pain or a depressive episode. It's hard not to feel hopeless and terrified every time I think about the future.

Does anyone here have any success stories? Thank you for the help!"
Are suicidal thoughts supposed to always just be kinda.. there?,35,mk89pc,16,"Last few days been okay, not super depressed. But, today Ive been feeling a wee bit down. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for several months now. They always just kinda seem to be there? Sometimes I'll be in the deepest pits of despair and want to commit but, like today, it was just kind of sitting there in my head. I was feeling a bit depressed, and the thoughts of just offing myself came through again, like, subconsciously. I didn't want to do it, but it was still there. Its like this, even on really good days, or neutral days. I dont want to off myself, but the thoughts still swarm my brain.

 Is this normal? Do suicidal thoughts just never go away as long as you struggle with depression? 

I would like to know other peoples experiences. I can't rely on anyone anymore, and so I turn to anonymous folks online. I feel as if i should tell my therapist this, but i dont think she'll do anything."

I don’t know how to explain that it wasn’t just the minor thing, it’s everything in my life. Everything is always just below the surface and when it comes out It’s like this darkness that completely surrounds me until I can shove it back in.

Just Blogging for Self Post-Smoking,3,mk7za4,0,"Sort of a cross between here and r/leaves, but damn it's just a strange moment in time.

Recently got terminated after I gave a verbal two weeks notice, but I saw it coming, so it didn't matter. Sometimes it just hurts being told to go home. Eligible for unemployment because I never put it in writing, but that's not even the point. I've constantly been in a cycle of smoking pot to sort of mask these feelings I'm currently feeling. 

""I am full of emptiness"" is just a repetitive thing to feel. Constantly doubting what I want to do. Picked up sketching, but no interest in past few weeks. I start, but then realize I am only doing things so that I'll become ""the greatest"". I have such a big ego and no matter how much I acknowledge it, it is so hard to ignore it and just do things to enjoy things. I am constantly in a rut of wanting to become the best at whatever I do. Not like I show this, but if I feel like I'm wasting my time not working to become the best of whatever I do, then what is the point? I know the point is to just enjoy myself, but that seems like such a waste. My head is the biggest enemy, it keeps me back so much. 

It is so hard to just live life. I've constantly had these dull and numbed out feelings that my safest place in the world is in my dreams, which is so strange, because that's the source of all my problems; my head isn't it? 

I used to be able to just smoke and  find enjoyment to my activities, but now whenever I stop smoking to try and enhance or further myself..I become stuck, dull, boring. In front of people I'm just a machine of humor, and it feels so real when I'm with people. Take me away from socializing, take me away from working, and now I feel like absolutely garbage. These are normal things and I get it, but my therapist doesn't do much other than listen. I wish he would ask me questions or make me think in ways I can't, but I am constantly being a devil's advocate to every decision and everything I do. In the vicious cycle of depression and anxiety I am the quickest person to instantly punish myself; even if the sketches are great, or even if the video game finds its course...If I can tell the pattern I tell myself in some way that its pointless to go on because, of course, ""I have figured it out""...Even if I haven't figured it out, it just feels that way and pushing on more just becomes so uncomfortable.

  
Everything is so uncomfortable. 

I wish you all the best; stay safe and stay human."
i’m experiencing extreme sexual dysfunction and idk what to do,0,mk7xp2,0,"so i’ve been on meds for a little over two yrs and for the most part, theyve had moderate negative effects on my sex drive. within the past four months or so, i started two new meds to combat my depression. at least one of these has made me nearly asexual. 

i’m a 20-something male and it’s starting to make me afraid of what else could go wrong with treatment. i’ve seen so many positive changes (better mood, etc. ) but this side effect is really putting a damper on me. i’ve begun to self-medicate with weed and alcohol in an attempt to make myself have more of a sex drive and more consistent erections but i just don’t think it’s a sustainable solution. tbh i don’t even know if weed/alcohol even helps. 

i really don’t know where to go from here since the meds are really important (i’m on four psych meds and i dont wanna stop them and go thru withdrawal, plus theyve made positive effects). i’ve talked to my psychiatrist but i really didnt get much from the talk except the possibility of ED meds and switching psych meds. 

i think the scariest part is the thought my sex drive is gone forever. 

any advice? i’d greatly appreciate it!"
Resources for Athletes,1,mk7vve,0,"Hi everyone, I was wondering if anyone here knew of any resources for athletes who have suffered a serious injury. For context, I am a 26 year old young professional. Sports have always been a large part of my life, there really has never been a single space in my life when I wasn't traiing. I recently messed up both of my shoulders wrestling. I will need to undergo surgery later this year, and to be honest the thought of getting surgery is a huge source of anxiety. The thought of me being out and ""handicapped"" for several months is tough. I feel as if I've lost a part of my identity. Is there a group somewhere for invidiuals like me I can connect to?"
I made a poem out of my situation and my feelings. What's your opinion? can you relate?,37,mk7vd4,3," **The Urging And Crawling Despair**

*A Poem by Noel*

&#x200B;

Whose despair is that? I think I know.

Its owner is quite sad though.

It really is a tale of woe,

I watch him frown. I cry hello.                                                                                                                                                              

&#x200B;

He gives his despair a shake,

And sobs until the tears make.

The only other sound's the break,

Of distant waves and birds awake.                                                                                                                     

&#x200B;

The despair is urging, crawling and deep,

But he has promises to keep,

Until then he shall not sleep.

He lies in bed with ducts that weep.

&#x200B;

He rises from his bitter bed,

With thoughts of sadness in his head,

He idolises being dead.

Facing the day with never ending dread"
It hurts so much. I don't feel ok.,1,mk7tbf,1,Something happened recently. I'm getting intrusive thoughts about how I need to be away from everyone. How I'm not worth it. Fixating on my flaws. I'm just hurt. I'm sad. Heart break sucks. I try to keep preoccupied but I always loop back around to wanting them to talk to me. To greiving. This is how it is I guess.
"It seems much of my depression was mostly situational, but didn't fully realize it.",26,mk7sin,8,"I recently got a job at a private airport, and I do various things, such as assisting mechanics, processing plane rentals, etc. There are a lot of people there that I can really relate to and have conversations with about technical stuff, plus I feel like my life is moving forward, and overall it is a very interesting job.

I would used to go to bed feeling empty inside, and I generally didn't find much joy in life, but now I don't have that. I think my depression was mostly caused by a lack of joy in my life, and I just couldn't fully directly correlate it. I still use dipping tobacco, which I noticed can boost my mood and get me motivated, so I don't know if I am still partially depressed. 

I just wanted to say that. Maybe my simple success can help others here."
Feeling really useless,1,mk7s31,0,"19/M
Recently I’ve been doing nothing but procrastinating my college work and calling off of my relatively really good paying part time job but all I’ve felt as of lately is just a hollow feeling in my chest at times. I will get frustrated with myself so easily and take it out on others without even realizing it especially when it comes to the things I pride myself with being somewhat knowledgeable or good at such as games, if I play like shit my attitude automatically turns to shit and I usually tend to raise my voice slightly when on call with my girlfriend who I’ve been in a long term relationship with. Turns out she has to move out a different state soon for college and this just makes me even more depressed and frustrated at the world that one of the only things that makes me happy is leaving me for the next two year and I feel like going to school is just me wasting my life and I’m not gonna end up amounting to anything in the long run. While I talk up how successful I’m going to be when I’m older and I try to give others advice about life I feel I often throw aside my own mental to take the time and reflect on how shitty of standards I hold myself to and the only thing I truly think I’m good at is a fucking computer game. Even then am I really I’m just stuck an emotional standstill in my life and I don’t want to get my relatives or my gf involved too much because she has problems of her own and my family sees me as a functioning adult as of now at 19 but I still feel like I’m just a literal sack of potatoes and some days I can’t even muster up the motivation to do the things I’ve always wanted to do... just thought I’d rant about it here so I can take a break from the constant break downs I’ve been having after affecting those around me and myself I just need some advice. /:"
Too many meds,1,mk7qn1,5,"Doctor has me starting up pristiq and tapering off Wellbutrin and escitalopram simultaneously and holy shit it’s weird. My mind is clear but I’m so far behind on everything. I want to finish all my research and I also want to die. There are too many and not enough things to do. None of my code works. I am the most useless graduate student that has ever existed and I’m going to fix everything. I know how to fix everything but I don’t know how to get to the other side of my brain. I want to tell everyone to go fuck themselves and just play with my neighbor’s cat because I love her. Nothing is right. It’s too bright outside. I don’t know how to even pretend that I’m a human being for all the meetings I have tomorrow. What the fuck is even going on? Why is it April? Why am I allowed to use a computer? Eventually someone’s going to realize that I’m some sort of weird imitation humanoid thing and I won’t be able to do research anymore. How do people like just do work and then relax in the evening and go talk to friends and go for walks? None of that shit makes any sense. I have to micromanage everything in my life to barely extract like 4 hours of decent work and then try to set it all up again. I don’t think about anything else. I’m thinking about work 24/7 but I barely do any. I don’t think of anyone except my neighbor’s cat because I love her. No one else lives this way. I think depression combined with anxiety makes me a different species almost. I don’t get the things people do. I’m a robot that knows how to write Python and shop for groceries and someone just set me up on a while loop to just do this forever. I don’t understand restaurants or bars. I don’t understand families. I don’t understand why people in my family want me to be there, I don’t add anything materially valuable to the things they like. I’m a leech and my code doesn’t work. This is weird sorry, but I need to tell someone all this shit that’s in my brain. I can’t tell anyone I know because they’d probably call the police and the police scare the fucking shit out of me even though my brain would be screaming at me to reach for one of their guns which would be fucking funny. My fucking roommates would have to clean up afterwards. Liars and propagandists. They think I lied about the pests. Fuck you then, now you know what a brain smells like. But not actually, the act of actually inducing death by some manner scares me too. Sorry, like I said, just need to explain to someone the way that my brain is because I don’t understand why I think these things. I just want to get out."

Eight months since my diagnosis and six taking antidepressants,1,mk7apz,0,"Hey there! I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety last year. It was a tough time for me. I lost a lot of weight and l didn't have the strength to live. My psychiatrist prescribed me antidepressants and though I do feel better, I still have some bad moments. One day I feel stable and the next one I sink into a depressive episode where I just can't stop crying. It makes me believe like all the happiness I could have felt before, was just my mind trying to convince everyone and me I was fine. Have you felt the same?"
dont have motivation/energy for anything at all,4,mk77i2,2,"i only really have motivation to play videogames and watch youtube, but thats really it. i wanna do alot of other stuff like programming, but i just cant be bothered enough to do it. even thinking about forcing myself to do it feels immediately draining and i just cant handle that feeling so i end up just not doing anything. sometimes i cant even get myself to play videogames and i end up in a limbo of watching random youtube videos even tho i actually wanna play some game or even do programming. or even further i sometimes just cant even get the motivation to move at all in any way, as even the thought of it feels draining and i just wait there collecting enough energy to just click a button once. its really painful and the only things i can do outside of what i already said is fueled by things like my ocd, causing me to write this whole post as a form of compulsion. hhhh i just wanna do... stuff"
"I'm so tired of having to freak out before I get attention, then people make all these promises so I don't get that low and then they can't hold to them",8,mk7511,6,And I can't keep reminding them because it makes me feel like I'm fucking bothering them no matter how many times they say I'm not
It Always Feels the Same,1,mk6zm7,1,"This is something I wrote earlier today. About 20 minutes ago actually. I just want someone, anyone to care enough to take a look at me and wonder if they’re being lied to.

I hate motivational quotes. 




God I had a whole thing planned out. I was gonna sit down, write this entry, and go on a whole tangent about how I hate motivational quotes. I was gonna write an entire essay. But now ow that I’m here... I can’t. But I do hate them. 

I hate motivational quotes. But as soon as I go to express my feelings... it all just goes away. It’s not just my hatred for quotes. There’s a girl, Lucia, I think I like her. That’s a lie, I don’t like her. I mean as a friend I do, but not romantically. I haven’t been able to like anyone romantically since January of last year. 

Where was I going with this? Oh right, I 

No I don’t. I don’t remember. Why am I writing this? Why the fuck am I writing this? I shouldn’t have. 

Now I’m just... not motivated to do any of this. I’m on the brink... well I’m actually not on the brink of tears. Why do I keep lying? I’m writing a journal entry that only I’ll see. And maybe random people on Reddit if I decide to post it there for karma. But why do I keep lying? Is it for effect? Maybe I want to have depression. Maybe there’s something deep inside me that wants to be broken. Maybe I’m actually fine. Maybe in just an attention seeker. There’s nothing wrong with me. I’m just vain and selfish and I act like I have an illness when I don’t. Constantly disrespecting and spitting in the face of people that actually have depression. 

I’m such a fucking terrible person. 
It hurts me just to think and I don’t do pain."
I just need someone,1,mk6z4w,1,"I’ve been a mess for about two years to the point I almost committed suicide. But for the past two days I’ve been feeling even worse then usual because i got in a fight with my sister(not physical just words). And today our family had a really big fight about it. I know that it was all my fault and I’m feeling incredibly bad about it. Its just that my family is really messed up, starting from the part when they wanted a divorce but didn’t get it because i was accidentally born ending at the part where my mom hates my sister for no reason and the other way around. But thankfully I’ve managed to mend they’re relationship a bit but it doesn’t change the fact that my mom doesn’t love my sister as much as she loves me. Because of that I’ve been feeling like shit because i blame myself about it. If i wasn’t born then maybe my mom would love my sister. Maybe my sister wouldn’t be mean to my dad. And maybe my dad wouldn’t be in such a bad shape. I’m blaming myself for everything bad that happens in this house because if I wasn’t born then everything would have been better. And for context my family gets in conflicts all the time. And after every time im in my room crying because i know that if I wouldn’t exist then they would be happy. Im just full of emotions that have been boiling inside me for the past two years. I’ve always blamed myself and i never spoke to anyone about how I truly feel.I’m sorry if this is confusing its just that there is so much that i want to say but it’s physically impossible to write it down. I just hope that you get the idea. But most importantly i hope that you are doing better than me.."
Back in Stride,1,mk6ugz,0,"I wrote this a few weeks ago on my birthday. It’s mainly just me saying how I feel about stuff and being scarily welcoming to scary thoughts. I just wanted someone, anyone to know. I don’t wanna talk about this to my friends or family.

The suicidal thoughts are back. I’m imagining posting a cryptic video of me reciting song lyrics and posting it to Snapchat. I stop recording and stand on the edge of a building. That video will be the last thing anyone ever hears from me. Then I lean in, let go, and feel fear for the very last time. 

It’s my birthday. It was good before everyone came back. I don’t like how chaotic it is here. It was much better whenever I was home alone. 

I didn’t really like the celebration of my birthday. I never like them. I like knowing it’s my birthday and getting all the wishes, but I hate sitting down with a cake and celebrating with everyone. I don’t not like my birthday, I just don’t like celebrating it. Because then I get drained, and tired, and self conscious, and the suicidal thoughts come back."
Utter confusion,1,mk6qnl,1,"My husband and have had the same group of friends for the biggest part of 20 years. We have gone on vacation, welcomed grand babies, said good by to loved ones and many other things with these people. After the pandemic started we stopped seeing them a lot. We had invited all of these people to our home. All of them came over. I recently learned there have been girl weekends, Halloween parties& Christmas parties that we were excluded from. I am deeply truly hurt. I am experiencing a hurt I have never felt before."
I'm an insecure piece of shit,5,mk6pkx,2,"I'm feeling anxious right now and it's so fuckin stupid. I was playing with my friends and I can't avoid the feeling that I'm not as fun as them, that I don't deserve them and lot of thoughts of that type came to my mind. I can't go to parties because I will ruin the mood for sure, I won't be able to make the person I love happy... I can't stop thinking that any person would do better than me. That also makes me jealous and I don't want to, I don't fuckin want to think that way of my friends. I know that I'm a piece of shit but at least I don't want to be a jealous piece of shit."
I can't watch romance anime,5,mk6pif,3,"I can't watch romance anime.

I'm a 19-year-old Swedish guy and I can't watch romance anime anymore. Anytime I try it just gives me something close to a panic attack and the feeling of dread over the fact that I've missed out on any kind of romance and won't ever experience anything like that hurts a lot. It doesn't even apply only to especially romance anime. Every time I see in any type of show a kind of romantic relationship i have to shut it off.

And from what I've experienced isn't this something I can fix like my personality. It's from the simple fact that I'm just really fucking ugly. If you wanna have a reference point I'm a worse-looking blond version of the person you will see if you google blackopscel which makes me just feel hopeless.

// Rant over and sorry for my bad english"
Help,3,mk6mzr,1,"I need help.  I'm not functioning, I feel like the world is closing in on me.  It's hard to breathe, it feels like I am trying to fight against an immense pressure that is coming down on me from some unseen hydraulic press.  I feel like I'm existing in some demented dimension where morning never comes and evil rules the realm, oppressing me until I don't remember who I really am anymore.  I don't remember what it's like to actually live my life, to accomplish things, follow a routine, make plans and stick to them.  Anything I think of to do, no matter how mundane or ordinary, feels like a big, insane, wild, far-fetched pipe dream.  I can't tell what's realistic and what's not anymore.  I mean, I'm *aware* that going to the grocery store and making a doctor's appointment are perfectly normal, everyday activities, but I *feel* like they are just insane notions that would never work.  Like, I may as well hitchhike to Disneyworld to sell paintings I stole from the Museum of Contemporary Art, because that feels at about the same level of normalcy as trying to get a job in an office or a store.  I feel absolutely insane sometimes, the way everything just seems so overwhelming and huge.  I'm being pressured by everyone in my life to get a job, and it just seems so far beyond impossible.  Impossible is getting up, taking a shower, and doing errands and chores.  That's an impossible day.  Going out and getting a job, then going to work every day, on top of homeschooling and housekeeping?  That's just so entirely inconceivable that it feels like a completely foreign idea to me.  And it's not a foreign concept to me, not at all.  During times in my life when my psych disorders weren't so bad, I was a productive forceto be reckoned with.  I worked, went to school, belonged to organizations, had a busy social life, and carried extra work on my shoulders in the way of research, writing, blogging.  All on top of my home life.  And I thrived! I was productive, happy, and healthy.  But now, in the depths of this infinite abyss of depression and anxiety, the girl who did all those things, who made big plans and reached her goals, seems like someone else entirely.  Maybe someone I read about one time and admired, but could never hope to be anything like myself.  I have been trying to find some freelance writing jobs, but I haven't had any luck yet.  I've also been working on hand-painted home decor to sell on Etsy and other online retailers, but I'm still unhappy with most of my pieces.  I also signed up for Doordash, Grubhub, Instacart, and Postmates, but was unable to do any of them because they all do very extensive background checks, and I used to be a bit of a bad girl with compulsion issues concerning retail theft and substance abuse, so I have a few dark marks sullying my background.  These companies were unimpressed by that, and informed me that I would not be welcome to offer my services to them.  And, at least for the time being, that's the type of work I need.  I need a flexible, fully personalized way to make money.  If I'm working for someone else, if I'm unable to get out of bed or don't have the wherewithal to perform my job that day, I will lose the job, and gain another negative employement experience on my resume.

I don't know what to do.  I'm a mom, a very involved mom.  My son is my light, and the thing that keeps me going when nothing else seems worth anything.  He's the thing that inspires and motivates me, keeping me from falling apart entirely.  I homeschool, and he deserves to have me be healthy, alert, and whole, and I deserve to be able to enjoy watching him learn and grow, I deserve to be present and excited about the life my family lives together.  I deserve, and my family deserves, to be able to get ourselves into a better situation, to move out of my in-laws house, have our own home, our own plans, routines, and traditions.  But right now, all of that just feels so, so far away as to seem entirely impossible here and now, and highly unlikely at any point in the future as well.  Every day I wonder what's going to happen when we have to start doing things differently, when we are no longerable to live rent free.  What will become of me, will I end up on the streets?  It feels like it sometimes, though I know my husband would never let that happen to us.  

I need help, like I said.  I keep making doctor's appointments and missing them, either because I get too overwhelmed to go to them, or I forget about them entirely.  I am on medicaid, so I have to jump through all these hoops to eventually see a psychiatrist, which is not something I'm really capable of doing while I'm in the place that I'm currently in.  I keep thinking maybe I should check into the psych ward to get some therapy and get on a medication regimen, which is something I've done with much success several times in my life.  I just worry about my son's reaction to having me away in the hospital.  I don't want to leave him.

I know that it sounds like I'm whining and making excuses, and I hate that I sound that way, it's disgusting to me.  Believe me, though, I have tried gritting my teeth and hitching myself up by the bootstraps and grinding through.  I have tried the ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach.  It's not working.  I'm in the worst place I've ever been in, it's never been this bad.  In the 22 years since I've been a diafgnosed depression and anxiety sufferer, I have never suffered to this degree.  I have never felt disabled or invalidated, but I do now.  I feel like I am suffering from a terminal illness, like my days are numbered and few, like I am approaching a very dark and horrifying end.  Not suicidally, just that time is running out.  I don't want to die, I just want to stop feeling like I want to die.

I am sorry for the long, pathetic post.  Thank you for staying with me. through the whole thing.  I'm not looking for pity, I am not just here to bitch and whine and say ""poor little me, please feel bad for me.""  I swear, I'm not, though I'm totally sure that's exactly how this reads.

Really, the point of this post is that I simply can't do this anymore.  I need it to stop, I am so incredibly sick of this being my whole life.  Every single aspect of my life is influenced by depression and anxiety.  Every.  Single.  Aspect.  The big things and the tiny things.  It's exhausting, and I am at the end of my rope.  I need help, and I need it ASAFP.  I don't need it six months from now when I'm finally able to get in with a psychiatrist.  I need it right effing now.  Does anyone reading this have any suggestions for getting psychological help on an immediate basis?  Including medication.  We have a lot of behavioral and mental health outpatient programs, but they don't prescribe medication.  Not only do they not prescribe medication, you are also not allowed to be on medication while receiving services from them, because they all deal with substance abuse as well as mental health.  I need to see a psychological medical professional who can prescribe meds as well as provide therapy.  I need to know how to see one fast, fast, fast.  

Thank you in advance for any and all helpful advice."
How to deal with parents who get upset at you for “moping around”,2,mk6l5d,2,"I’m a 20 year old male still living at home. I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was 14 and have never really found a good way to deal with it. I’ve taken anti depressants for a few years but I’ve never found it to make me completely feel better. My parents are pretty strict and love the idea of “the perfect family”, they make sure we always eat together, spend time together etc. Sometimes though when I’m not up for it I’m just sort of there physically but not mentally. Their response to this is to be get upset and tell me to quit “pouting”. I’ve never talked to them about my mental health nor do I want to since I find they’re a large source of what makes me feel shitty sometimes. Was hoping someone who has gone through this before would have some solutions on how to make it better cause it can be pretty upsetting sometimes"
trying to feel less lonely,1,mk6hri,1,"even before the pandemic started, i was insanely lonely. i have irl friends, but i feel like i can't ever talk to them about how i feel bc I don't want to burden them. even when i get really close to telling them about  my problems i chicken out at the last moment. i've never had a real relationship, just 'situationships' with guys who didn't care about me at all. i was hoping to meet a guy in college but i only went for one and a half semesters before the pandemic hit and we all got sent home. next semester is in person which gives me hope but it's only april now and the thought of having to exist for several more months feeling like this makes me want to not be here. i've never felt so lonely in my whole life and it just gets worse every day. i feel guilty bc it's easter and i've spent the entire day holed up in my room. so, i was just hoping for any kind of interaction to distract me from thinking about how i have to exist on this earth for ??? more years. music recommendations, talk about your pets, talk about your day, anything - i just need some semblance of human interaction right now"
I'm tired today,2,mk6hmy,4,"Pretty much just as the title says. A couple of different things are coming together to leave me feeling very drained and weary this evening. I'm not suicidal or anything, but the thought of just falling off to sleep and quietly passing away sounds awfully nice, you know?

I'm fine, I mean nothing is imminently going wrong and I can pretty well identify the things that have me feeling extra down today and therefore can reasonably assume that this won't last too long. But it's certainly no fun while the glooms are here. I wish I could easily get out of this. I wish I was able to find comfort in my faith the way other people do. I wish I wasn't feel so utterly disconnected from humanity. I wish lots of things, some of which may someday come true, some of which cannot.

Just writing this out to try and ease today's burden a bit. I'm not really going anywhere in particular with this and I suppose I've blabbed enough for now. Thanks to anyone who cared to read and I hope you find some comfort in whatever struggles you may be going through."
Feeling nothing is worse than feeling sad and feeling suicidal,2,mk6d7d,1,"I feel pretty much nothing. I was depressed pretty bad for a long time. I could work and I could learn anything, couldn’t do anything at all. I still have some problems like with hygiene and some smaller things...but I’m now in a state where I feel nothing. 

I can work and I can do what I have to do. In the past I had suicidal thoughts all time. Now I have them sometimes and they are not as bad as they were. I miss the times were I could feel really bad, be sad and cry. Thinking about suicide helped me, even if this sounds crazy but at least I could feel something.

Now I’m pretty much numb all the time and I’m in a state where my head never stops thinking but my head is literally thinking nothing. Does this make sense? Like I get a headache from thinking but I can’t tell you what I think, it’s like my head does it without telling me. 

Anyways I hate it, this neutral numb state is awful."
I feeling really depressed,3,mk6ccb,4,"Today is my last day of spring break. Holy shit it has been awful. I planned to do a lot of work, finally finish some work from a while ago to get the credits. I didn't do anything. I also had to work on a stupid current events assignment for one of my current classes. My teacher didn't explain it well, and when I asked him for help he just made me feel bad. I keep thinking about committing suicide. I don't want to, I have cats and guinea pigs, and a family. I wouldn't want them to have to deal with that. I also keep thinking about selfharm. I've been crying a lot more than usual. I don't know what to do."
I wanna get up From bed already,3,mk6cbd,3,"Spent the Last 3 days in bed, depressed and I haven't taken care of myself. Please tell me what I should do"
My dog died,55,mk6bby,6,"The guilt is eating me up, the last couple years I’ve been gravely depressed and I didn’t take her for many walks even though I was the only member of the family home during the week. She did get walks but not as many as she should have in the last couple years of her life and I feel so sorry. I did cuddle her and slept a lot"
"At this point my wife is pretty much my caretaker, I can't believe how lazy and selfish I am. How can I be so fortunate yet so unwilling to do anything?",1,mk66og,4,"I should of killed myself when I had the chance recently. I should of killed myself back in 2018 when I had the chance. I should of realized I was hopeless before I met my wife so I wouldn't drag her down.

I don't understand why won't she leave me no matter how much I beg."
i'm worried for my mental health,1,mk63vr,1,"I am currently seeing a therapist after a traumatic relationship that brought up past feelings of low self worth. everything is dull. my relationship with my parents is struggling because i find no joy in going for walks or playing board games. the days run together. i cant remember anything long term. i cry myself to sleep at least 3 times per night. everything just hurts. my therapist said i should get an adhd test because i zone out and get distracted by nothing when i drive and when im in class. she wants to keep monitoring me for depression symptoms but her decision cant come soon enough. i just wanna know whats wrong with me. why am i so sad. why does everything hurt me. 

my question is how were you all diagnosed with depression? is there a test? or does your therapist just decide. i just want to know whats going on with me."
IT HURTS SO MUCH,5,mk5z8u,1,"IVE CAUSED SO MANY PEOPLE SO MUCH PAIN. IVE HURT SO MANY PEOPLE. I RUINED SO MANY PEOPLES LIVES. WHY AM I LIKE THIS. IT HURTS. TGE GUILT THE SHAME THE REGRET THE FUCKING GRIEF. I WANT NOTHING MORE THAN TO PICK UO THE KNIFE AGAIN AND TEAR MYSELF TO SHREDS. I CANT EVEN SLEEP ANYMORE. I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE. I NEED THE PAIN. I FEEL SO FUCKING GUILTY.  
  

I feel so alone. My head hurts. My former best friend is now a drug addict and an alcoholic all because i couldn’t forgive him for what he did. If I had given him a second chance he would be okay. That’s the last think I needed to find out. The guilt hurts so much. And now I’m alone. I’m so alone. The isolation. The loneliness. It hurts. I keep crying. I keep breaking down into sobs. I don’t want to be this weak. I want to be strong. For them. Why does being alone hurt so much. I don’t know how much longer I can last for. Tomorrow isn’t going to be better. Sooner or later I’ll have to give up. Sooner or later it’ll break me. Sooner or later I’ll die. At least then everyone can be happy."
Almost killed myself today,1,mk5ybw,1,"The only reason that I'm alive right now is that I couldn't find a knife to do it with. I fucked up in school and my parents got pissed, which is pretty normal, but the thing that made the thought enter my mind was 2 things, 1 my parents said ""you were just being lazy and no one in this family is lazy"" which made me mad for two reasons, one my dad is hella lazy, like I think the most not lazy thing that he has done in the past few weeks is either go to the store, or mabey building my little brothers a fort (with I still did most of) and two, I'm probably not going to ever stop being lazy which made me realize that I'm going to be poor and possibly homeless. And the second thing is that not thirty minutes after I got yelled at, my brothers got caught doing the exact same goddamn thing and got in zero fucking trouble."
How depression really feel like,17,mk5xjd,4,"The voice inside my head is screaming but no word cross my mouth. Feels like a deep black hole inside of me which eats all of my emotions. My body is functioning but I don’t feel like I’m breathing. Just existing in this world full of money, superficial people and sex. Everyone wants love but nobody is willing to give love. Nobody see the pain inside my eyes but I can see the pain in everyone. My eyes scream for help but no one can hear me. Why I am the only one who feel this way? Am I an alien? Standing up in the morning only to go to the bed at night, not crying anymore because every inch of myself is numb, drowning in the hole inside of me. You can’t tell anyone because everytime you talk people hear you but they don’t listen. They don’t understand what I’m saying. In the end we will not remember how much we had, money or a nice car, we remember the people we loved and cared about, but they are so rarely. We all want a long hug from someone we love, but nobody is willing to give it, even it would be so simple and helping. 
We are lost in the universe, just floating."
I just want to die,2,mk5wro,1,"It’s been like this for like 5 years maybe even longer IDK man...Family doesn’t care ‘coz I’m not successful....Nobody cares except female friend of mine but honestly who knows, it doesn’t matter. I can feel how she is losing interest in me and eventually we will become strangers that used to talk. Probably gonna kill myself after that. I’m just a fucking disappointment who is afraid of therapy..."
The Paradox of Opening up to People,5,mk5vyu,3,"Anyone else struggle with opening up about depression to people? These last few weeks have been some of my lowest in recent memory. Ironically, I have had some external success in my professional career during this stretch, but my internal mental health has just been awful.

Recently, I've often found myself just spending time alone at home and drinking. The feeling I experience of emptiness and hopelessness is nearly unbearable, which leads to me wanting to reach out to some of my friends. But this is where I've noticed a bit of a Catch-22 in this regard:

On one hand, I am lucky to have pretty supportive friends. They would want me to reach out if I am suffering. But, doing so would both (1) make me feel like a burden; and (2) likely make me regret doing so. I have opened up in the past to some of my friends and while it feels good to get some things off my chest, the net benefit I receive doesn't always seem worth it. Additionally, the resulting light they see me in changes. Their new view of me might be more accurate, but I don't know if them ""looking down"" upon me (if you will) is worth being able to get something off my chest. (Sidenote: I think the ""looking down"" reaction is the both due to the overall stigma mental health carries, as well as my specific situation -- being a depressed man in the midwest.)

On the other hand, the aforementioned feeling of regret is probably better than just continuing living through this pain alone like I am now. Maybe reaching out is shitty, but at least it's something. And just maybe will it be better than the alternative this time."
I’ve never had a human like me,5,mk5udx,2,"Male or female, nobody has ever wanted to have any romantic contact with me in any sort. I’ve tried everything, putting myself out there, being more reserved, trying, not trying and still nobody has ever wanted me. Depression only makes this worse or maybe this only makes depression worse. Either way, I’m at the end of my tether and I just want someone to experience. Happy Easter"
How can I keep going on,1,mk5sax,0,"Growing up I had a very shitty childhood living with my grandparents full of emotional, physical and sexual abuse. It left me quite damaged and anxious. Rather than help me deal with it, my parents pushed me away to focus on their 2 younger children that weren't harmed. With me cast out, they are the perfect family unit.

Fast forward to me in my 30s, still hoping to be happy in my life and now I am waiting on a medical diagnosis that could potentially change my entire lifestyle. I feel constantly at my breaking point and I don't want to live like this anymore. 

I look at my partner and never want to hurt him and want him to have the happiest life possible. But I don't want to go on anymore. I know he and everyone else would be better off in the long run. I just hope he knows how much I love him.

All of this is too hard."
Everything's getting worse day by day,3,mk5jt5,1,"It has been 3 years of depression. I don't even want to fix myself anymore, life sucks. Everything I've done brings me nothing, everything's getting worse everyday, my condition's getting worse mentally and physically. There's no happiness left for me in this world"
I don’t know what’s wrong with me.,1,mk5ha3,0,"Everyday I go to sleep, I just wish I wouldn’t wake up. This world has beat me down so low, i’ve just given up. I’m literally a month away from graduating college and I want to drop out, i’m destroying my relationship with an amazing girl because of my problems. I have so many insecurities and problems, i’ve tried therapy, anti-depressants, I just don’t know what to do anymore."
Isn't it partly my fault?,1,mk5eni,0,"I don't get out of the house unless my parents convince me to. I don't do schoolwork unless my parents do it with me. I don't reach out to people when I feel lonely. If I'm not even trying to make it better, aren't I partly to blame?   


I don't know if I want to be told that it's my fault or if I want to be told that it's not. Maybe I'm craving attention? Maybe I'm feeling sorry for myself? And even if I'm not, Maybe that's what people think I am doing? Do I not know how I feel or is that just something I like telling myself?   


Yeah, I guess that's it. Thanks for reading."
Will This Even Work Anymore ?,2,mk5bqp,2,"I feel as if working out, making myself look better and all the other self help advice isn't working. I don't feel all that differently and still am alone. Dont know how much longer I can do this."
Tired of feeling tired,1,mk5blq,0,"I'm just done, i have been tired for so long, therapy doesn't seem to help, medication doesn't help either, not suicidal but honestly just done with everything i don't have energy to do anything and I can't for the life of me understand how anything could improve... Serious debt, almost zero likeability or at least not appealing enough to be rejected 5 times(for a serious relationship) in the last three years, i don't even have the energy to continues studying and I'm doing my dream career. WTH am i supposed to do?
Edit: Diagnosed 5 years ago with severe depression, anxiety attacks, and ADHD."
My stuffed animals and pets are my only friends.,10,mk5a01,2,"I'm starting to feel ok with it! Honestly they aren't just objects to me anymore, they are sentient beings. If i talk to them they talk back, i love them because they don't judge me . They have personalities.

My pets are the same, i love them very much. My two cats will lie down next to me if i am crying . And my stuffed friends accompany me too. Something 'real' people won't do.

I know this is creepy to some people but i don't give a shit. Nobody cares about me, so why should i care what they think. Yes i do believe my friends have sentience, I don't see anything wrong with that. Except, maybe the fact that i am losing my sense of reality, But i don't care. I've been alone for so long that i need to make my friends myself.

Sorry for this unsettling post, i just needed to get this off my chest. I plan on getting more friends and just covering my bed with them."
feeling so lonely,4,mk583y,7,"i seriously feel like i can’t talk to anyone. i feel like a burden and my problems are small. i’m legit having one of the hardest times in my life and i’m trying to get through it alone so i can feel independent. i know people won’t be there for me forever based on how they’re acting now. i text some people and they rarely answer. that’s including my sister. i’ve lost my self love and all my support. desperately trying to survive. sometimes i don’t even feel like i can tell my therapist, and they’re BEING PAID to listen to my problems. i hate myself and i wish i didn’t. i am trying to love myself but my life is so difficult right now. someone please tell me they love me and care about me. i don’t even care that you’re a stranger. i just need a virtual hug."
Are some people actually happy in life?,9,mk583k,3,"I’ve felt constantly worried and down for so many years, I can’t imagine people waking up every day with a positive attitude. People that don’t fantasise about dying someday. It’s so foreign to me."
16M with 4 years of straight fucking depression,4,mk56kk,2,"No hope, no willing to live. No motivation, no desire to do anything at all. No ambition. Literally nothing for years. Why the fuck am I even alive? Why would I want to wageslave for some cuck government who’s ripping everyone off? Why would I pay the police their fucking salary? fuck ooooofffffff. Then they put in suicide prevention to make people alive to generate more money. Fucking shitlords."
Life is not what I thought it was.,2,mk55h2,1,"When I was young I’ll had the idea that I would work hard, graduate high school,  get a job, and find a girl to settle down. You know the whole white picket fence “America dream”. it was going well I had good group of friends, a steady job albeit backbreaking(I stacked pop), and a girlfriend who I loved. It was actually going well, I asked my wife to marry me things where looking up. Then the bottom fell out... 6 days Before my wedding my pastor who was a father figure more so then my own dad backed out of being in my wedding. I didn’t handle it well, my mother was playing in it and was at his church that day while I was screaming on the phone like an hysterical idiot, “I’ll kill him, why would he do this to me” I told my mom on the phone. Well wouldn’t you know someone was listening to her conversation which made everything worse believe me. We figured out how to change the 
Ceremony to fit, but I was dejected beyond belief. My mentor had backed out because I moved in with my girl 2 week cause of winter and her drive... fast forward almost four years, and I am still dealing with those problems. All my “friends” have pretty distanced themselves from me. I lost my job, I quit right before this pandemic. My work didn’t trust me as that whole ordeal was going on while I was working. I didn’t take a week off like a normal person for their wedding I just took the weekend off. And my boss was out for me. Meanwhile, my wonderful wife got pregnant because she wouldn’t listen to get on birth control. She wouldn’t go to the doctor until she was 4 months into pregnancy... I love my wife and my son, but she drank a lot and didn’t listen to me at all when we were first married. I can only imagine the wedding had to do with it. He is 2 and a half and doesn’t talk. I didn’t want to have a child so soon, but I was married. I didn’t want to raise a son in an apartment so we moved back in with my folks. They were part of the few people to support me through the whole wedding fiasco. But fools gold isn’t the real stuff, and it has been hell dealing with them. My mother worries about everything she deals with depression to, and my father is an asshole. He is constantly telling me something I’ve done wrong belittling me when I try to help out. He is one of the most passive aggressive people. Summerly, I am jobless, living with my folks, with no network of people who care. Stuck in this stupid pandemic at home with all of this stress. Life isn’t what I thought it was..."
Does anyone else relate? Help!,1,mk54yo,0,"I've lived a huge chunk of my life not understanding a thing about boundaries, and I've let literally everyone walk over me, to the point where people closest to me would also unknowingly take advantage of that part of me. It all obviously fed into my depression, and I (as a lot of depressed people would, unfortunately) always shouldered all the blame. I blamed myself for having others walk all over me, etc. I've been working so much on my mental health the past couple of years (with a therapist), and thankfully I've learned so much about boundaries and I am very happy to at least say--I know how to nourish myself and my mental health better instead of self-sabotaging (still learning, though).

But... Something new I've been struggling with--I've always been someone that's particularly quite hard to get angry or rile up. But nowadays I just find myself thinking about the past and getting angry. Just angry, at random times of the day. At people--at everyone who's done me wrong. Who saw the state that I was in and let it happen, or even *caused* it. Even if they didn't mean to hurt me, even if I still love them... (I understand cutting toxic relationships, and I've cut a bunch too, but sometimes humans do make mistakes, nobody's perfect. At least that's what I think..)

I don't think I really know how to control the *anger*, or more like, accept the emotion??? because I've never really dealt with an influx of anger where I'm angry about something I've previously blamed on myself before. This is kinda affecting my relationships right now cos I'm not able to process and articulate my emotions properly (to myself, much less others!). I'd ask my therapist about this but she's been super booked for months--so I thought I could ask reddit, if anyone relates....

Thank you in advance. <3"
Im just fucking tired,19,mk53rb,5,"I hate not being in control of my life, physically and emotionally. I hate being incompetent and I hate being at the mercy of my emotions. I wish I could pursue what I actually desire. For years Ive tried to make ANY compromise with myself. I am tired, so damn tired. Depression ravaged me beyond repair"
I feel like I’m just being melodramatic,2,mk52hm,0,"Sorry if I’m breaking the rules here or posting to the wrong subreddit. I just felt like I needed to get this off my chest and this seemed like the right place to do it. I’m more just venting than anything, so sorry for the lengthy post. 

Objectively speaking, I have a great life. My parents are supportive of me both financially and emotionally. I’m getting to go to college and get hands on experience in the sciences. I don’t have to work a job full-time while taking on school. I’m not discriminated against on a regular basis and most of the people I know are pretty kind to me. I know most people probably have it way worse than I do, which is why I feel awful that I keep struggling with depression and anxiety. 

I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder and am fortunate enough to be taking medication for it. I’m taking 16 units, tutoring, and doing research on the side, and just with managing those I feel like it’s a constant cycle of barely being able to make it for most of the day and experiencing a brief moment of relief when the day comes to a conclusion. I’m not doing great in lab (as a flipping chemistry major), and continue to make an exorbitant amount of mistakes every time I come in, testing the patience of my peers and professors. As a result of my slow, clumsy nature in lab, a lot of people have advised me against trying to apply to medical school, which would obviously be a lot more difficult in that regard. This makes me kind of depressed since that’s what I’ve been interested in for as long as I can remember. I know you gotta be strong enough to keep improving yourself to prove them wrong; it just feels discouraging when you don’t seem to get much better even when you’re trying. 

Socially, my insecurity just tends to kind of get in the way. I can count the number of friends I have on one hand, and none of them really reach out to me. When I do reach out, they’re usually nice, but don’t seem all that invested. It kind of feels discouraging to feel invested in somebody else when it isn’t reciprocated. As you can probably guess, I’ve never had a romantic partner either, since my confidence is just ridiculously low. I know it’s something I need to work on, I’m just not sure where to begin. 

Simultaneously, I’m struggling with my faith quite a bit. For most of my life, my Christian faith has kind of been my rock. I don’t want to turn towards apostasy, but I get less convinced by the evidence for my beliefs with each passing day. 

Obviously, these are all normal problems to have and nothing unique or even severe. And I’m still functioning well enough to make it through my classes and fulfill my other responsibilities. When taken together, though, I just continue to feel depressed and have a hard time focusing on the good in my life. I’ve tried running, talking with my parents, and making schedules, but nothing seems to really work. Does anyone else feel like they have a pretty objectively good life but just have a hard time getting through it for some reason? I’m sorry if I’m being insensitive or should be posting more concisely, I just felt like I needed to let it out somewhere. 

TLDR: feeling depressed with managing everyday stresses despite having an objectively good life. Makes me feel melodramatic; anyone else feel similarly?"
Why is everything so exhausting with depression?,5,mk50b8,1,"I don’t think my dad understands how much energy it takes to do basics as someone who is depressed. Ive put on so much weight in the last year. Partly because i cant motivate myself to exercise, but also I’m struggling to shower daily and take medication, never mind plan and cook healthy meals. Why does taking care yourself seem so hard? And how can i explain this to someone who loves me, but i think doesn’t understand."
"My life is literally worthless, I have nothing and I'm just rolling down",9,mk4y7i,2,"I hate my life, literally is worthless, I live in some shitty place,  I  spend my entire days in front of my computer and while doing nothing.  I can't go outside, I have no one to spend my time with or it's raining all the, I can't do any sports outside and inside too because of my small house I'm living in. I can't afford any gym or anything, actually, everything is closed for almost a year because of this fuckin virus. In my house is the same, I can't find my self in my family,  one day I laugh with my parents or talk to them like a normal human begin and the next day is only screaming and arguing suck at everything too, my grades are horrible and I have no interest and even if I find something interesting it is either too expensive or impossible to achieve (for ex. I always wanted to work on some astronomy but telescopes are so expensive and I  can't afford it or It's impossible to see anything in the ""city"") I literally spending by days died and not begin alive.

I'm 17 and I graduate school in two years. I have no memories so far, no friends, no passion, nothing. I so unattractive, never have been in a relationship or have a real friend and  I'm fat as hell.

I  just want someone to help me or anything that I can spend my time at."
Borderline,1,mk4vzz,0,"I suffer from borderline personality disorder and generalized anxiety for all my life but 2-3 years ago after a string of emotional events, my emotions just switched off. I used to feel so much — a little too much (as borderline people do). I was such a vibrant, empathetic, and forgiving person who always saw the good in situations/people and stayed positive. Now the world is all grey, flat and all I feel is numbness or the occasional BPD trigger (rare, compared to before). 

I got diagnosed with major depressive disorder a month ago and I’m currently on Wellbutrin 300 XL. Ive never been on medication prior to this. I feel like my BPD triggers happen a bit more often now, and honestly it’s better this way because at least I can feel emotions like extreme sadness and hurt sometimes. 

Can anyone else with BPD relate?"
I'm so tired of having to pick myself up on my own every time,4,mk4vqq,1,Why won't it stop hurting what did I do to deserve this i always have to do this shit on my own I always have to cry for hours and fall asleep emotionally drained and then wake up lifeless and like someone's stabbed me in the heart.

I hate my life,1,mk4uti,0,"For context im a 21M have had issues with my skin and scalp for over 6 years and it just to the point where I'm starting to not give a fuck about anything. 

I'm not going to kill my self because that would be wrong but I'm just hoping I don't have to live like this for long. 

I cry every night about how useless I am, unattractive, stupid, weak, everything Is meaningless, whatever I try to do nothing works... my family I'd poor yet I try and work hard to get into engineering just so that covid can fucking get me laid off and now I need a job or else everything is over.  We have barely any money, I don't even eat breakfast until 3 pm. FUCK OMG the more I type the more I realize I hate this even more.

I have gotten my mother forgiveness for all the shit I have done and I'm content with my life. Don't really want anything else. 

How do you go on in your life knowing that whatever your doing has no meaning, doesn't impact a large audience, the money you make is valued base on what people make it worth, all this materialistic shit is useless. 

I just wanna be happy"

I fucking hate humanity for this,1,mk4p54,0,"Me and my friend in online suffer from depression and for now she have mental breakdown. Even if i sold everything i have in online, there is not enough money to go to her, i also don't know what to do because she have abusive grandparents. I just wanna hug, not be alone again. Why when i need really close friend, they always go away or they have something like this... I've never been even hugged, i want to help her at least survive mentally until i arrive ;("
Should I email my teacher?,2,mk4gn7,5,"So one of my teachers is really nice, at one point when I was feeling really low in class, she asked if I was ok, i said i was fine but later i emailed her saying my mental health is bad and she replied with  something along the lines of ""you can talk to me at any time if u want"". Then another time, I suddenly felt completely numb and empty at school so I skipped her lesson and hid I the toilets for an hour then after she asked why I skipped and I said it was a bad day and she said, in a really nice voice ""you know you can talk to me right?"" And then I emailed her again saying the particular reason why I skipped and she said again that if i wanted to talk/write to her then to feel free.


Anywayyy, I've been feeling shit recently and my family is aware and everything but when I talk to them, they seem really sad because they know there's nothing they can do. I really want to talk to my teacher/write her an email just sort of ranting, idk why. Would it be inappropriate? Also I'm worried she's gonna feel awkward because what can she actually do/say except for ""lolz sucks to be u"". My life is great, I just feel shit. 


Tldr: one if my teachers is really nice and told me I can talk to her if I want to, should I send her this ""rant"" email or is it pointless"
"""Just situational depression""",1,mk4g5f,0,"Hey y'all, 

So I've definitely been depressed for 8 years straight (was finally diagnosed about 4 years ago). While I have a lot of shitty life situations that have definitely made it more obvious and much worse, I actually think my depression goes back to childhood, with a bit of a reprieve in my early to mid 20's. I remember how miserable I was as a kid. I never smiled and had no friends.

Yet, my family (who I love and am really close to) keep telling me that my depression is ""just situational"". I have two siblings who were diagnosed many years ago, and since I was only diagnosed fairly recently in comparison, they believe mine is just the result of my life being really stressful, whereas theirs is clinical. My mom, who has never had depression, also thinks this and has said that I was just fine as a kid (I really wasn't, she just wasn't the type of mom that was great at the emotional support, hence the 3 of us all having depression).

They all agree that I've been depressed for the past 8 years straight. Can situational depression even last that long? It seems like whenever I talk about it with my siblings, it always becomes a bit of a competition, like they want to think they have it so much worse, especially my sister. It's annoying, anyways."

Save me,1,mk4as1,0,"I need to leave my country
My country is small nothing wrong with it, it's safe and great 
But everything around me triggers me
EVERY SINGLE BLOODY THING. 
And I hate everything around me.
But I am very patriotic
I really can't take it anymore.
I genuinely don't know what to do.
All I'm doing it going to work, getting home, and then drowning my self in alcohol.

I have am I trying my very best to get a job overseas I'm constantly applying everyday but I've not gotten anything fruitful, I've been sending around 20 applications everyday.

And I don't have much friends. I used to have too much.

I don't have anyone whom I feel that would shed a tear when I gone.

It suck, it sucks to know you don't mean anything to anyone expect as a normal friend.

I wish to mean something to someone someday.
It sucks to realise that no one bothers when you don't reply their messages
And those who do, are just using you as you're always there


Someday I wish I meant the same who other people meant to me.

I really wish someone could save me 

And I genuinely wish no one goes thru what I go thru. I don't wish for anyone to have that choking feeling in your throat when don't know what triggers you and when it does triggers you, you burst out crying but you simply can't as you're on a train or in a bus or in a meeting
Where you have to force yourself as a grown men not to cry in public and find a place like a restroom where you have to cover your mouth with force that you can't breathe so that no one hears you crying.

She also said that they don’t date yet but they had the eye contact and they saw that they liked each other and soon they’ll start talking. She told me as an excuse that this happened cuz we live in different countries and it wasn’t possible to be together. She seems like she really likes that guy. I’m really hurt. I didn’t expect that from her. She said she didn’t mean to hurt me but it just happened. She truly promised me the entire world. I was literally everything to her. I’m speechless. I’m hurt. Idk what tf to think anymore. It’s finally over. Wow! I can’t believe it. I’d sacrifice myself for her sake and i mean it and now she does this. Just wow. I guess it was meant for me to get hurt lol. Yea it’s not funny, I actually feel really really bad. My mind can’t get that my girl, that i love with all my heart, is interested in someone else. World is so cruel. I was living for her. Now she’s gone. My heart was beating so purely for her. She was all i ever wanted. Women complain that good guys don’t exist and when they find good guys, they hurt them. This is so ironic. It’s ridiculous. I feel betrayed. So much. I don’t wanna be in love again. It always hurts. In all this 1 year and 5 months of our relationship i was genuinely happy af. Y’all can’t imagine how happy she made me. I was so so grateful to have her in my life and I promised her that I’d never leave her. It turns out that she left me. I feel disappointed and hurt. I really don’t deserve this. During our relationship i was treating her the best way possible and was always ALWAYS caring about her. It was the happiest period of my life. My heart is not strong so now i feel awful for what happened. I’m calm for now but later I might really cry thinking about her having another guy. I was so good to her and i get treated like that.

Is it depression?,2,mk46ip,0,"Hi,
I don’t know if what’s happening to me is a result of depression and anxiety or just my stupidity on my part. I’m enrolled in classes and studying to get my first BS.

I’m in my 40’s and I feel like my time has passed but there’s a lot riding on me finishing and getting a job that can support my significant other and me. When I’m reading my focus shifts elsewhere. My dr prescribed adderal and I’ve been taking it but I’m still feeling the same. It has to be me and not the depression or the medicine, right? I’m so confused.

I have such a good life compared to so many. I have a good job, a great husband, we own our own house, two nice cars, and we have seven pets. I have a close family, and a few very good friends. And yet, I feel like I want to die everyday. I feel like a failure. I feel like I fall short in every arena, even if everyone is telling me it’s not true. My house is never clean enough. It’s a fixer upper, and we are slowly working away. But every time I see an unfinished project when I’m in a bad headspace, I freak out and have a panic attack. I’m not a good enough employee, daughter, sister, wife. I never have energy at end of the day. I want to love on each of my siblings and nieces and nephews individually, but it feel like there are too many, and I can’t even seem to stay caught up on laundry. My job is commission based, and we get super busy in the spring. I’m a dog groomer, I get booked weeks out and then people start to get upset. I’m in high demand, but it only makes me more stressed. I feel guilty making dogs wait for weeks for a haircut. I keep adding more hours to my workday, and by the end of spring I’m completely burned out. This morning I woke up and realized that it’s my first Easter without my grandpa. We were very close and he passed away in October. I don’t know what to do with all the feelings. I’ve tried medication, and I haven’t had good results. The last one I was on took my sex drive completely away. Then I felt like a failure as a wife even though my husband tells me over and over it’s ok. I’ve been off them for a few weeks and I still can’t even think about having sex. I also know being off completely isn’t working. These suicidal thoughts aren’t safe. I know if I killed myself everyone would be devastated. My husband says he can’t live without me. I feel like I just can’t continue on. I’ve felt like this since I was eleven. Will my life always be a constant cycle of wanting to mill myself, or dealing with horrible side effects from meds that aren’t working? Today, I feel horribly tired. I want to let go, but I won’t. Not yet."

"I'm about to break it off with someone who made me feel really happy for a short while, and it hurts.",4,mlqlel,1,"It was nice while it lasted, and I felt really happy in the beginning. Butterflies in my stomach when reading her texts to me, visits every day, thoughts of going steady, the whole shebang. I couldn't stop thinking ""Where have you been all my life?"" and other stupid clichés I had written off as emotionally unavailable to me as a depressed person. It gave me a sense of being whole again. Love was made in the space between us.

And now it's gone. Last time I saw her it felt like none of the magic was there, and I was in the company of someone who didn't care. She had a bad day, my presence didn't matter and no connection was left. I could do nothing to cheer her up and I got none of the chemistry I adored in the beginning. We haven't spoken for a week. Tomorrow I'll have ""The Talk"" and clear out this gnawing feeling of uncertainty and dread. Then I'll be alone again. But I'll rather be on my own than with someone that makes me feel alone."

Help with depression,5,mlptok,2,
I want to give up,4,mlpj6z,2,"I've tried to commit suicide twice in the last 6 months. Both times were unsuccessful. The first time I overdosed on prescription meds. The second I tried hanging myself but was too scared to complete it (which has made me feel like more of a coward for failing both times).

Anyway, I don't enjoy anything that I used to enjoy. I'm not an attractive man. I don't trust people friends or family. On the outside things may look good in my life (got a job, no debt, drive a average-nice car etc). But on the inside I'm hurting. People walk all over me at work. I could just quit my job sell all of my things and live on the street. I'd be no better or worse.

Ive felt stuck for a long time. I have no idea what to do."
How did this happen?,2,mlqg25,0,"For the first time in my life, I find myself having ""passive"" suicidal thoughts.  A slow-burning apathy has taken over, a shift in mindset toward the all-too-logical realization that it literally would not make a difference to me if I did not wake up tomorrow. You cannot miss what you do not have. 

I do not want to hurt myself, nor do I feel as though I would be better off dead.  I simply now perceive a quietness in death. The only reason I cringe at the thought is because I know my family would be devastated. I truly feel if no one in my immediate family were alive, I would not care if I woke up or not. 

The spooky (or not spooky?) thing about it is that while I recognize this is a change in thinking, I do I not care. It makes me wonder if ""this is how it starts..."" for people who become seriously ill. I know no one goes from 100% to shit overnight, for most it is a slow burn and that makes me worried about what's next. 

Who can relate?"
How do you stop hating yourself?,2,mlq2cn,1,"I had depression for about 3 years between 2015-2018 and never once did I actually resent myself. More so I pitied myself, ran scenarios in my head constantly and distanced myself away from people into isolation and broke off key relationships and ran away to a different country... I was very much suicidal at that point.

The dark thoughts are coming back again, thoughts of suicide, but this time, I actually hate myself. I am very emotionally intelligent so for the last few years while I’ve felt down, I’ve managed quite well to overcome my struggles. This time, I actually have no fight in me because, as I’ve said, I hate myself therefore I feel like I deserve the misery I’m feeling.

Does this mean it’s time to stop fighting?..."

Mom is dying of brain cancer and I have no hope for a better life,66,mlmqnm,8,"I worked very hard for a long time. In 2017, I decided to stay sober and focus on being responsible, volunteering, improving myself. Nine months later some teenager hit me with his car (no trial, no jail time), shattered 13 of my bones, and ruined the sensation in my right hand. A year and about 100 PT sessions later, my mom was diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, which has now become a glioblastoma; she’s immobile and can barely speak. This diagnosis came less than six months after she retired. 

Over the past four years, my dog died; my ex — only person I’ve ever loved — married someone far more handsome and richer than me; I lost my job as Covid hit, despite making so many sacrifices; and now I’m living at home, over 30, my mother’s caretaker. I think I’m also becoming an alcoholic. 

I don’t want to travel. I don’t want to fall in love. I don’t want a pet. I don’t want a good job. I don’t want a nice apartment. I don’t want to meet new people. I just want this all to end."
Happiness just isn’t for me.,209,mlcbpl,34,"Ironically I’m just more comfortable with sadness. 

I feel safer that way."
I'm 22 years old and I'm mainly depressed because I've never had a girlfriend,34,mlmc73,9,"My mum always told me my depression is most likely reactive and to an extent I do agree with her.

I can enjoy blissful moments in life especially while I was a lot younger. However when you are younger it is so much easier to be innocently ignorant to the way society works.

I understand having or experiencing a relationship doesn't fulfil everything in life or provide happiness, just like money doesn't provide happiness, or big homes provide happiness. Being rich doesn't provide happiness but one needs money in order to survive. I also understand that some people would rather be better off without one. But that's easy to say if you hop from relationship to relationship like hopping on a plane or take your experiences for granted because of your looks or social skills that a lot of men and women would kill for.

This is sort of how I feel about my relationships. They are almost always platonic or acquaintances partially because I choose them to be that way. I have been so isolated for so many years that I think it is destroying me layer by layer until it finally reaches areas of my soul that won't be able to take the further destruction. This is down to my childhood and being blamed for the way I was born and thus inevitably being bullied, rejected and outcasted most of my life. Including now however it is just a lot more discreet and how it is shown.

I'm not saying for a second this is all down to not having a girlfriend. It definitely isn't. But it is definitely a large chunk of it and I'll explain why.

One of the main reasons I was bullied in school for many many years was because I had never had sex. I think at least half of my friends lied, but it was much easier for them to lie than it was for me; because genetically there was so much wrong with me it was impossible to lie and keep up the pretend. Not only did the bullying of the situation become the icing on the cake; but the romantic fantasies I would concoct made it a desire impossible to bare at times being from ages 8-16 having never experienced a single thing. Most of my classmates have now either had children or had ten plus relationships at my age now being 22. This is why I always feel like there's something wrong with me.

I do believe some of these experiences are distractions from inner problems; and I'm not denying this is true. However what I am denying is that 'relationships don't matter' because they do. Being able to obtain a relationship, matters, having connections, matters, even if you prefer to live the more lonesome life like I clearly do.

I just wish there were girls I could meet where I would not instantly feel a pent up rage inside of me assuming they are going to instantaneously judge me on how I look despite how hard I worked for 5 years to make changes to my face, body. It never changed my genetical features which ultimately has made all of it feel like a waste of time because women have rarely felt any sexual attraction towards me; and if they did, it was to use me for their own gratification or an ego boost, or because they wanted something from me.

Most consider me average looking but I know the aura around me I sense people truly believe I am below average to quite ugly. The blanket stares I get from people can be quite hard to deal with and sometimes this can happen even in my own closest family and friends and can be really tough to bear.

I just wish society focused less on looks and more about the kind of person someone is. I understand it's becoming more this way now especially since so many people become abused in relationships due to focusing on the wrong factors; however do not less this stray from the clear fact that most people get dismissed if they do not find them even slightly sexually attractive.

And this is ultimately why I am so depressed everyday. The more days I wake up the more I feel so lonely and my heart sink lower and lower feeling like I am falling into a pit which I can never crawl back up from. It gets harder and harder to pick myself back up and feel like I can grasp the steering wheel and get my confidence and self worth back up.

I honestly wish myself and everyone good luck for the future in their endeavours and I am very aware there is more to life than this but my one true desire in life is just to be able to experience the ability to obtain a relationship."
Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn’t mean I’m depressed because of the pandemic.,1886,mkx1uq,83,"I’m tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I’m just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn’t me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn’t the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties."
What does it feel like to be told you're beautiful? To hear the words 'I Love You'?,87,mlctpu,43,"It is the deepest hope and desire of my heart and soul that one day I will hear these words, but I know I never will. As a teenager everybody said ""well you have your whole life ahead of you"", ""don't rush it"", ""you'll find somebody some day""... the usual clichés.

Well, now here I am pushing 40 and I am no closer to finding love now than I was when I was 16.

My heart is empty. It is broken. I feel worthless. I am so empty, and broken. All I want in this life is to be loved. I want to be somebody's everything. And I just don't know what it feels like. I won't lie... I get jealous when I see others loving on each other. I'm happy people have been able to find love. They're so lucky.

But what is it about me? My family tells me I'm beautiful. But they're all lying. If I am really beautiful, why doesn't anybody else- who isn't family- see it? If I was beautiful, wouldn't a guy have approached me by now to ask me out?

And before anybody says ""maybe they're intimidated""- that's not the case at all. I literally have a 100% track record of rejection. I have lots of guy friends, and I've even developed a crush on a few of them. But as soon as I say ""hey, I like you- want to hang out/go to the movies/grab dinner sometime?"" they immediately turn on me and not only do I get rejected, the friendship dissolves.

I just don't understand. There's something wrong with me that I don't see and nobody will tell me what it is. Am I really not that pretty? Am I really that ugly nobody wants to give me a chance?

I just want to be loved."
Never open up to anyone,19,mlndge,9,"I’ve learned today not to tell anybody how I truly feel. Even someone I thought I could trust. This person asked me what’s wrong after I had a sobbing breakdown today. At first I said I’m fine, just having a rough day. You know the usual deflection. They said that they’ve noticed I haven’t been taking care of myself lately as much as I should (for context I have stopped taking antidepressants). They said they could tell something is bothering me. So I thought they sound genuine in their concern, why not tell them that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and that even the slightest problem can push me past my breaking point (hence the breakdown earlier, triggered by something stupid). 

I don’t know what I expected, but all I got in response to opening up was a blank stare and now I’m being ignored. No support, no “hope things get better”. Fucking anything would be better than this. Right now I’m feeling so stupid for thinking anyone would understand. What’s the point anymore. I don’t trust anybody."

I’ve been diagnosed with depression and Anxiety and I often feel anxious about trying new things. I’ll never get these days back and it’s upsetting me hugely"

Not sure what to say but here goes.,13,mlndt9,1,"I know so many of us are in pain and it just isn't fair is it?  I'm 53 and have suffered from OCD/Clinical Depression since I was about 15 or 16.

I have achieved none of the life goals of a ""regular"" person.  Significant other, decent job, house, car, love, any happiness. 

I got sick about 4 days ago.  Dizzy, nauseous, sinus, chest pains and I am all alone.  Being sick in bed alone has made me reflect even further on my life.  I know life isn't supposed to be fair, but a little joy would have been nice.

I've barely been out since the Covid kicked in last March.  Recently, I went to the dentist and had a look at myself in the mirror and was absolutely shocked.  I looked so haggard.  Like I had aged at least 5 yrs in 1.

For those of us who deal with Depression on a regular basis, we know it won't go away when Covid ends but I believe it has hit us harder.  Especially, those of us who are isolated.

Anyone else scared of going out in public even more now because you feel even worse about the way you look or feel?  I dread the summer.  The 14 hr days of sunlight.  I literally hate the daylight."
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",2327,doqwow,175,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
"Regular Check-In Post, with important reminders about the No Private Contact and No Activism rules",151,m246c4,597,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, please ask us.  

********

**Please keep in mind that no activism, i.e.  advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues, is ever allowed here.**  

It's not that we're against activism.  We're strongly in favour of it.  But we've learned the hard way that it doesn't work within a dedicated support space, so with regret, we can't allow it any more.  Thanks for understanding.  *Please report any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's mainly about a cause or an issue rather than a request for personal support.*

*****

**Despite the fact that we always maintain a sticky post about it, we're still seeing a lot of violations of the private contact policy.  Please read /r/depression/wiki/private_contact and report any violations that you see.**  Widespread disregard of this important rule causes trouble for both helpers and vulnerable OPs, wastes our time, and delays the improvements we're making to the community resources."

Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn’t mean I’m depressed because of the pandemic.,1887,mkx1uq,83,"I’m tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I’m just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn’t me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn’t the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties."
What does it feel like to be told you're beautiful? To hear the words 'I Love You'?,90,mlctpu,43,"It is the deepest hope and desire of my heart and soul that one day I will hear these words, but I know I never will. As a teenager everybody said ""well you have your whole life ahead of you"", ""don't rush it"", ""you'll find somebody some day""... the usual clichés.

Well, now here I am pushing 40 and I am no closer to finding love now than I was when I was 16.

My heart is empty. It is broken. I feel worthless. I am so empty, and broken. All I want in this life is to be loved. I want to be somebody's everything. And I just don't know what it feels like. I won't lie... I get jealous when I see others loving on each other. I'm happy people have been able to find love. They're so lucky.

But what is it about me? My family tells me I'm beautiful. But they're all lying. If I am really beautiful, why doesn't anybody else- who isn't family- see it? If I was beautiful, wouldn't a guy have approached me by now to ask me out?

And before anybody says ""maybe they're intimidated""- that's not the case at all. I literally have a 100% track record of rejection. I have lots of guy friends, and I've even developed a crush on a few of them. But as soon as I say ""hey, I like you- want to hang out/go to the movies/grab dinner sometime?"" they immediately turn on me and not only do I get rejected, the friendship dissolves.

I just don't understand. There's something wrong with me that I don't see and nobody will tell me what it is. Am I really not that pretty? Am I really that ugly nobody wants to give me a chance?

I just want to be loved."
Never open up to anyone,20,mlndge,9,"I’ve learned today not to tell anybody how I truly feel. Even someone I thought I could trust. This person asked me what’s wrong after I had a sobbing breakdown today. At first I said I’m fine, just having a rough day. You know the usual deflection. They said that they’ve noticed I haven’t been taking care of myself lately as much as I should (for context I have stopped taking antidepressants). They said they could tell something is bothering me. So I thought they sound genuine in their concern, why not tell them that I’ve been having suicidal thoughts and that even the slightest problem can push me past my breaking point (hence the breakdown earlier, triggered by something stupid). 

I don’t know what I expected, but all I got in response to opening up was a blank stare and now I’m being ignored. No support, no “hope things get better”. Fucking anything would be better than this. Right now I’m feeling so stupid for thinking anyone would understand. What’s the point anymore. I don’t trust anybody."
Is life worth living after 18,15,mlobvi,5,"I’m turning 18 soon and feel like I’ve wasted my teenage years, I’ve had good memories but I haven’t done a lot of things like go to parties or get into relationships like most people my age. Ive got a good group of friends but I don’t think I’ve lived my youth to the fullest. I must’ve only been to about 5 parties in my life and I’ve only kissed 2 girls ever. I’ve been diagnosed with depression and Anxiety and I often feel anxious about trying new things. I’ll never get these days back and it’s upsetting me hugely"
it sad that many people see others in pain like them but don’t have the energy to comfort themselves so they can’t even have the energy comfort others,44,mlgf50,15,i just wish life was better to people that’s all
Not sure what to say but here goes.,13,mlndt9,1,"I know so many of us are in pain and it just isn't fair is it?  I'm 53 and have suffered from OCD/Clinical Depression since I was about 15 or 16.

I have achieved none of the life goals of a ""regular"" person.  Significant other, decent job, house, car, love, any happiness. 

I got sick about 4 days ago.  Dizzy, nauseous, sinus, chest pains and I am all alone.  Being sick in bed alone has made me reflect even further on my life.  I know life isn't supposed to be fair, but a little joy would have been nice.

I've barely been out since the Covid kicked in last March.  Recently, I went to the dentist and had a look at myself in the mirror and was absolutely shocked.  I looked so haggard.  Like I had aged at least 5 yrs in 1.

For those of us who deal with Depression on a regular basis, we know it won't go away when Covid ends but I believe it has hit us harder.  Especially, those of us who are isolated.

Anyone else scared of going out in public even more now because you feel even worse about the way you look or feel?  I dread the summer.  The 14 hr days of sunlight.  I literally hate the daylight."
i’m wasting my life away,29,mlhk32,9,"i can’t find the motivation to do anything. i tell myself to be productive, to at least indulge in the hobbies i used to love but everything seems so pointless. i’m too tired to try. i just end up sitting and staring blankly at the walls and before i know it the day is gone."
I think I need to go to a psychiatric hospital tonight but I can't drive and I'm scared of worrying my parents,9,mlous8,4,I'm not doing okay at all I'm worse than usual today for some reason and I think I need someone to watch me but I don't have a license and I don't think I should drive without one and if I call them to come get me it's gonna freak my parents out and I don't know what to do
"I got genetic testing done, and finally have a reason for my depression",8,mlparg,0,"My genetic testing came back that I have ""significantly reduced folic acid metabolism"". My brain doesn't make neurotransmitters like it should. I know I had depression from a lot of traumatic events in my life, but now I know it's not just that.

After over a decade I have answers of why treatment never worked for me. And an answer to what's causing so many of my symptoms. There's a reason for all this. And a medication to help with the folic acid metabolism. I'm crying

Plus now we know what meds will work better for me because of my genetics. I didn't know this would change so much, and I really hope it's real"
Everyday it gets harder to get up,81,ml8tjs,4,"I just couldn’t see the point in trying anymore. Why would I, when everything that comes my way are just endless problems? I feel so lonely and unmotivated. Just today I could’ve caught up with my school deadlines but instead, I ended up just sleeping all day because at least I’m a little bit happier in my dreams. Every time I think of opening my laptop to start working, I get so anxious, which ends up with me just procrastinating more while feeling more and more useless. Another is that ever since I started losing my “mask” and began telling my close friends how sad I am, it seems like they’ve been ignoring or distancing from me. Not a single one of them has asked how I’m doing or what’s happening to me as if we weren’t even friends at all and it hurts so much. I had been there for them but now that I needed them, they’re acting like I’m a plague to be avoided. I just want things to be the way they were before...."
"I can't cope anymore. (13, he/him)",7,mlom46,1,"I can't. 
I've tried to calm myself down by playing guitar, and my Mum yelled at me because it's half 11, and too late. Fair enough. But now I feel worse.

I don't wanna eat, I don't want to do anything. 
I just wish I was dead. And this is every day, I feel like this. I hate it. I hate myself. I hate how I am. Why do I have to be trans and bi? 
Why couldn't Mum have just had a normal kid? 
I should be a girl, I should like pretty-pink, and dresses, and flowers and shit- but I don't. And I hate it. I shouldn't feel how I do towards girls- I shouldn't like them! It's wrong, and I'm so fucked up. 

I want to cut, but I am clean for 40days. I feel like shit. All I want is for some one to understand.
I can't speak to my Mum about *any* of this. 

Not my eating disorder, not self-harm, not about being queer, not about how I feel. She'll try get me help- I'm NOT dealing with CHAMS, or social workers, or anything like that, not again. 

I hate my self so much. Why couldn't I have just been normal? Why did Mum have to have a daughter like me? I SHOULD be her daughter, but I'm not, and I hate this! 

I hate when we argue, it's over stupid things, and I feel so bad after. I'm so horrible. It's not her fault, she has her brothers funeral to deal with, her having an autistic kid, with ADHD, who can't get ready in the mornings, and gets too confused, and everything feels too much- she shouldn't have to deal with that. 

I can't fucking wear anything other than hoodies, I have stupid fucking cuts all over my left arm, and all up my thighs. 

I stress over every little thing I eat, scared I'll get fat. Then I eat a shit ton of crap, and chuck it back up. What the fucking hell is wrong with me? 

Everything feels too much. I have school next week, that means sleeping at 3am, waking up at 5am, making myself exersise, go boil the kettle at 6, drink 3 coffees, and 2 green tea, and get dressed. ANNNNDD stress over every tiny little thing, and get distracted, as I do. Then get in the taxi at 7:20. Then school at 9, and school is not fun at all. I go to a SpEciAliSt school. (meaning all the other kids also have autism). There are only 7 kids in my class, I'm only friends with 1 of them. 40kids in the whole school, only 3 girls. I don't need extra education, or to be spoken to like a two year old, I don't need that, I need a mainstream school! 

Welllll. I got asked to veiw a mainstream, but, only 40% of the school spoke english, not being funny, but I am not willing to learn another language, and I wouldn't be able to make friends. And there is also a uniform...

I can't explain to my Mum that wearing a shirt (with a blazer-thingy), it makes me dysphoric because I can see my chest. (also- the sleeve might pull up, and I have cuts all up one of my arms, but it's nearly gone, I suppose :)
And all mainstream schools have uniform, so, I have to stay at this shitty school, where I'm not learning anything, have 1 friend, and it's a 1 hour and a half ride to school, 3 hours of my day is spent in a taxi! Fuck that. I'm not going back to school next week.

Also- with my eating disorder-thingy... Going back to school makes me eat A LOT less, and I'm more stressed. 

I don't even know how many calories is alot anymore. fuuuckkkkkkkk."
I want to make a girl happy someday.,133,ml6hkf,33,"I want her to know she’s loved. I want to play with her hair. I want to kiss her on her forehead. I want to laugh with her.

I want to take cute pictures with her. I want to do puzzles with her. I want to play games with her. I want to text her at work and make sure she’s OK. I want to buy flowers for her. I want to go hiking with her. I want to ALWAYS be there for her, no matter what.

So difficult to not kill myself..,4,mlqm4q,3,"Not here for 'attention' Not here to hear 'everyone is beautiful you'll be loved one day"" ""just be confident"" bla bla bla. Fuck off with that shit please. Im just tired of life. I feel like it would be so damn pleasurable for me to just end my life. I'd never have to wake up to this stupid ass torture existence. No professional can fix me being ugly, depressed, other mental illnesses. All they do is empty the wallet and repeat what i say, give useless coping mechanisms, and steal my money. Fuck them. I hate life. I think life is actually hell. I was ignored my whole life growing up, i have nothing in me to be interesting so i'll be alone forever. I have anhedonia or whatever you call it. Nothing is pleasureable, nothing makes me happy, nothing excites me. So everything is simply suffering. I hate that I have to keep living, i hate it. Been depressed way too long.."
"I'm about to break it off with someone who made me feel really happy for a short while, and it hurts.",4,mlqlel,1,"It was nice while it lasted, and I felt really happy in the beginning. Butterflies in my stomach when reading her texts to me, visits every day, thoughts of going steady, the whole shebang. I couldn't stop thinking ""Where have you been all my life?"" and other stupid clichés I had written off as emotionally unavailable to me as a depressed person. It gave me a sense of being whole again. Love was made in the space between us.

And now it's gone. Last time I saw her it felt like none of the magic was there, and I was in the company of someone who didn't care. She had a bad day, my presence didn't matter and no connection was left. I could do nothing to cheer her up and I got none of the chemistry I adored in the beginning. We haven't spoken for a week. Tomorrow I'll have ""The Talk"" and clear out this gnawing feeling of uncertainty and dread. Then I'll be alone again. But I'll rather be on my own than with someone that makes me feel alone."
How does one *qualify* to have depression?,33,mlbn8c,19,"I tried talking to my family about my depression but was simply cut off by "" You haven't even experienced what life is, how would you know? I should be more depressed than you considering what I've been through.""

I've then approached my college's psychological counselor as I couldn't afford one outside. She thinks my depression is linked to my performance in academics. And she hasn't replied since.

If I commit suicide will I be finally qualified depressed? I don't have the courage to do so, will that mean I am a terrible piece of useless shit of failure? I'm pretty sure I m even more pathetic."
I have such a boring life that I'll get daydreaming confused for reality,4,mlq3g9,0,"I dont have the motivation to do anything so I day dream a lot, I'll daydream and get the motivation to prepare for an event... That I daydreamed"
Hurting,5,mlomzg,0,"When I was there for someone and they aren't for me. When I helped them during their mental breakdowns. No one is there for me. I'm hurting and no one cares. I look through my contacts aimlessly. Never will know what it feels like to be loved and cared for. Because no one cares, no one is there for me."
I’m an asshole,6,mloccz,2,"I used to think I was a really genuinely good dude, but that was a complete delusion. These past few weeks have been really hard on me but I can’t say I don’t deserve it. About a year ago I just started dating a girl that I had been seeing for about a month so what do I do the day after we started officially dating, I cheat on her. And somehow by some miracle she stayed with me and so began by far the best, strongest and most loving relationship I’ve ever had in my life. 9 months later and I had somehow managed to not do anything too assholey, but obviously that wasn’t going to last. My mixture of commitment issues and general piece of shittery gave me the idea that I needed to end the best relationship of my life before I got in too deep. But obviously I didn’t stop there before I broke up I had to download tinder because what’s the point of waiting right it’s not like the only girl I’ve ever loved deserves enough respect for me to wait until after we’ve broken up to do that. Anyway here I am 5 months later finally facing the fact not only did I treated one of the kindest most loving people I’ve ever met like some expired meat. But that I deserve this. I deserve to feel like a piece of shit because that’s what I am."
Neigbour almost caught me smoking some weed and snitched,6,mlo56b,2,"So my neighbour who I thought I was cool with reported me to my mum, claiming he saw me smoke weed. We have been friends with this neighbour dude for like 2 months and we even chilled a couple of times. Though I never mentioned I smoked. He is a cigarette smoker himself and he smokes like a pack a day . I never judged him for his habit and would have never thought about mentioning it  to anybody. My mum told me he stopped her on the road and told her a bunch of crap about me and my habits. How I wear my hoodie all over my face while out(I do it because of social anxiety plus to hide some of my ugly scars on my neck which I am always judged for by complete randoms) , how i am always in the house ( minding my business ) , how my window is always open( supposedly told my mum that I open the windows to blow out smoke which is a complete lie as I smoke in the woods ) , how I always walk in a hurry ( which he claims I do because I have something to hide) ,how I always leave the house to chill at the back of my parents house , he even went ahead and told her about the casual conversation we had where I mentioned that I hardly drink (he instead told her that I am a drunk) . Good thing my mum doesnt believe him  at all. But its just nuts to think that this dude whom I thought we were becoming close would say such things to my mum to try and get me in trouble. I have never even had an argument with him or done anything to make him hate me. I smoke like a quater of a joint daily to relieve my depression , I have never caused any trouble for anyone  but someone goes out of their way to snitch. People suck man, 
Imma move out as soon as I get my finances straight, graduated from uni in  december in a 3rd world country  + covid making it a bit hard for me to move. Sorry for ranting"
I want to give up,4,mlpj6z,2,"I've tried to commit suicide twice in the last 6 months. Both times were unsuccessful. The first time I overdosed on prescription meds. The second I tried hanging myself but was too scared to complete it (which has made me feel like more of a coward for failing both times).

Anyway, I don't enjoy anything that I used to enjoy. I'm not an attractive man. I don't trust people friends or family. On the outside things may look good in my life (got a job, no debt, drive a average-nice car etc). But on the inside I'm hurting. People walk all over me at work. I could just quit my job sell all of my things and live on the street. I'd be no better or worse.

Ive felt stuck for a long time. I have no idea what to do."
I want to just crawl into non-existence,5,mlp9ca,2,"The only thing that is keeping me from killing myself is the guilt that I will leave behind for the only person I have left in this world, my mother.  She was very happy living in our naïve country and she came to chase the very lies of the American dream just so that I could live a better life.  I never wanted to be born, I never wanted this life for me or for her. The constant pressure to make sure I can provide her with a better life is indescribable.  I wish she had a better son. I wish I could just crawl into non-existence and not have to have constant fear of the future or what is going to happen. I see everyone going to places and coming back, talking and toiling for reasons that I dont understand. I feel like I am chasing a goal that is never ending just to make sure I can provide her something of this life. I have chosen to exceed in academics and will be graduating with 200k loans from a doctorate school. I have always had an empathic style towards people and like helping others because I know what it is like to be at the very bottom. I know what is like to hear a doctor tell you over the phone that your mom has a cancer. I know what it is like to take your mom to dialysis machines 6 am in the morning just so that she can have her blood filtered out so that her body doesnt give out. I know what it is like to live in an apartment with rats crawling inside the walls. I know what it is like to look at your parent and lie to them and tell them everything is going to be okay but you know it wont. I know what it is like to keep begging insurance companies to cover medications because if they dont she will die. I know what it is like to take care of someone every single day while maintaining two jobs and going to full time school. I know what it is like to fake smile just to impress people so that you dont get fired from your job and pretend like everything is normal.  That empathic style with wanting to help others turned into embers and I dont know how much I can do this anymore.  Thank you for reading this far out. I know there are other people like here who suffer too and I hope for the best for u."

College Student Failing Classes and Overthinking myself to Death,10,mlijb3,5,"I am not doing anything. I’m failing all my college classes. And honestly? I don’t even know if I am just being lazy, or if I am actually incapable of doing them. This is because, a month or so ago, I totally got burnt out, lost my motivation to do anything, and decided that if I was ever going to recover from that burnout, I needed to stop holding myself responsible to the expectation that I do well in school, that I recover, that everything ends up “okay” in May. That expectation itself was too much of a burden. So, okay, I go and remove that burden. It helps my mental a lot. Except that the burden is being enforced by the people I love, externally – AKA, my friends, roommate, and parents (all while being very supportive and kind) I can tell fundamentally have an expectation for me to make it okay. And that external force is a burden, too. But I can’t exactly complain about them wanting me to have a facsimile of success – they are doing so in the most supportive way I can imagine. I cannot tell if the immense amount of friction I feel is because I did the right thing and am just still not ready to “get back on the horse” but the pushback from them is making me doubt, or if I genuinely did the wrong thing and regret it and need to keep pushing. But at any rate, I have no idea how to keep pushing. The problem is that I have the burden of expectations from those who love me, but not the social input from them to actually become motivated enough through their external expectations. And my internal circumstances certainly aren’t conducive to doing my work on their own. It’s interesting, how much my fundamental mode of doing work relied on having other people to enforce it. I wonder if I’ve always been doing my schoolwork and going to college through the motivation of others, like some sort of leech – or, less terribly, benignly using social interaction as a way to recharge, without burdening them more. I was diagnosed with depression a few weeks ago and put on medication. I think I have ADHD. But since I’m not formally diagnosed with ADHD, I feel bad about claiming to have it so I don’t, leading to a hell of a lot of impostor syndrome because I’m simultaneously actively getting diagnosed for it, yet don’t let myself think I have it enough to actually excuse my own actions internally. If you can’t tell, I’m dragging my feet through this shit. That’s my specialty, after all: thinking so much about how I might feel or should feel that I obfuscate my actual emotional response and deny myself that critical information, overthink myself to death and stack layer upon layer of thought on it until it develops a confusing patina of thinking so thick it gums up my brain and needs frequent removal (which I’m also uncertain of how to do effectively).

Posting here because I figure someone else must be going through some similar thoughts, and maybe would be able to help or simply empathize with me."
I don't want to exist,7,mlkzuj,1,I can't get anything done because i have no motivation i wish the world would end i dont have friends because i have bad social anxiety and even going to the store is uncomfortable and i don't trust telling about myself to others im also really paranoid i dont wanna really end my own life because it would create all kinds of things i dont want
Unable to Graduate,9,mlixtf,2,"I'm in the worst situation imaginable. I'm a senior in college and this was supposed to be my last semester in order to get my Bachelors Degree. I've been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since I was 16 and I'm 21 now. I was doing OK for a while and then suddenly my depression got significantly worse in the middle of this semester, to the point where I struggle getting out bed now. I've completely lost motivation to do absolutely anything and everything just appears pointless right now. And now I'm failing multiple classes because I literally cannot get any work done.

What makes this so much worse is that I have a job lined up for after graduation which I'm supposed to start in June, and it was my dream job. If I don't graduate in May like I was supposed to, there is absolutely 0 chance that I can keep the job. I have absolutely no idea why my luck is so bad that my depressive symptoms hit harder than ever before at the worst possible time. Fuck this disease."
Being laid off was the worst thing that had ever happened to me,9,mlhm47,5,"It has been 4 months since I was laid off from my software developer job. Despite countless applications and a handful of interviews, no job offers had ever surfaced. The more applications get rejected or ghosted, the more I feel as if there is nothing for me to live for. Some may say that getting laid off is a good thing because they think there are always better opportunities, but that is far from the truth. As more applications get rejected, I am realizing that there may not be a better opportunity for me. There is always someone more qualified and better than me, and it is making me feel worthless."
How do I change my outlook?,4,mlo5bq,3,"Basically I'm a guy in my 20s and I'm losing hope in the future if my generation and in my own future. No matter what I see or do, all I can perceive is the negative side of life, I feel like I've also conditioned myself to believe that this is normal and that I'm seeing what everyone else refuses to.

How do I change my outlook on life to be more positive?"
Overwhelmed and Lost,5,mlnxzu,1,"Just need to get this off my chest.

I grew up in an extremely unstable household. Not very supportive, adults acted like kids, mental and physical abuse, manipulation, constant financial problems...the usual. Despite all the hardships, I would try my best to hold my head up high and have the mindset that these difficult situations would make me stronger. And as long as I worked hard and was a good person, things would eventually look up. 

I'm in my mid-twenties and recently some problems just occurred in my life. I just feel like I can't catch a break from life, that everything the could possibly go wrong ends up going wrong. I don't understand why bad things keep happening to me. I'm not asking to win the lottery, I just want to stop feeling this misery.

For the first time ever I feel like I'm suffocating. I was always able to hold my head above water but now I feel like I'm drowning. I feel like I'm finally breaking. I'm not a huge cryer but at work today I'm not sure what happened. I was just working and all of a sudden I started tearing up and had to step away. I felt so overwhelmed.

I can't sleep, eat, get out of bed, I can't think straight, I just want to crawl under a rock and stay there forever. I'm so tired."

Does it really get better,18,mlcjys,5,"Does life ever really get better, cause i have honestly heard the same quote "" life gets better"" from every single person in my life and it just never does. Whenever i get a glimpse of hope that things will be fine something always destroys that. I am just mentally physically exhausted of every single thing. The worst thing is i have no fucking idea why am i so messed up i get traumatized over shit ppl get over so easily. I hate the way i look, i feel, the way i sound, i hate the way my brain functions. I just want to feel alive again."
Eating way to much junk food,7,mlioxf,1,"Ok so recently I've been feeling more depressed and whenever I'm depressed eat a crap ton of ice cream/candy/Doritos. I will fully admit I have an addiction to junk food and I need help because it's gotten to a point where I can't go a single day without eating or drinking something sugary. I realize there are much worse things out there to be addicted to but it's actually gotten to a point where I've been eating more junk food than regular food and I've noticed some discomfort in my chest about a week ago. I'm sure it has to do with all the crap I've been eating these past few weeks.  My dad's side of the family has a history of heart problems so I do worry a little but about how this will effect me. No matter how hard I try to not eat that stuff it's always a mixture of my depressive state because eating junk food does legit make me feel better like it gives me more energy and also the fact that I fiend really hard for it if I go a whole day without eating junk food.

Also I wanna clarify I'm only 20 years old and I don't wanna have heart problems this early in life cause I could only imagine how bad it would get latter in life. Also I'm actually on the skinner side believe it or not and I do hike and play pickup basketball to stay in shape so it's not like I'm totally inactive. But the point is the depression I feel caused a junk food addiction that I can't break for the life of me and while I might feel better in the short term when I think about the long term it makes me scared for what's to come."
my best friend confessed to feeling extremely depressed.,53,ml72f5,9,"i don't know what to do. my best friend recently sat me down and explained to me that he has been feeling very, very down lately and even admitted to having struggled with thoughts of self-harm and suicide. i just felt everything crumble around me because i hadn't noticed it.

i hugged him. tighter than i ever had before. and he broke down.

he told me about how he couldn't stop thinking about how ""he would be better off dead"" and how, ""you deserve better, anyways, you're too good."" and i felt my heart absolutely shatter into a million pieces. i love this guy more than anyone i know and i want nothing but the best for him. i tried being as gentle as i could while talking with him. holding his hand, rubbing his back and letting him now that i was here. and that i would continue to be there.

i asked him to stay with me for the time being, as i truly didn't feel safe about him being by himself every day. he obliged. he's been staying with me for about a week and we've begun talking back and forth about finding a therapist so he has someone to talk to. during this week i've noticed so many things i hadn't before. he spaces out a lot more. he has a lot of nightmares and rarely sleeps easily (i stay up with him until he falls asleep) and he always smiles like he's about to cry. i really, really want him to find someone to talk with. 

though i want to help him, i can't do what a professional does.

i wanted to come on here to ask, am i doing the right thing getting this involved? did i do something, that i shouldn't have? what can i do to continue to support him? i would really appreciate serious answers as i want to be able to support him properly. thank you."
Living to die,47,ml7a6v,7,"The thought ""I hope I die soon"" goes through my head every single day, multiple times a day. I bide my time, waiting, hoping, and manifesting my elimination. My love for my family stays my hand for now so I just pray for the end while trying to keep it together and be as present as my mind allows. I told myself this mental state was temporary and if I waited it out, I could feel normal again and find some joy or value in living. Unfortunately  I'm still not there.

This is my moment of weakness.

Up at 4am, crying silent tears of lament over who I used to be and my complete lack of a future. I don't see prospects for romantic love, a good career, or ever being able to contribute to my family's life in any meaningful way as I trudge along day by day chained by my depression. I'm watching my dreams turn to ash right before my eyes as I wait for my lost motivation to come back to me. 

Guilt and shame are my most common emotions. I don't know how much longer I can live like this. I just want it all to be over. The scariest thought, as I hold myself back from trying to just end it all, is that I'm not meant to die by someone else's hand or through sickness or through an accident. I worry I was always meant to live a long, unfulfilling life of mental suffering and self hatred. Maybe I'm the only one who can carve my way out of this horrorscape. 

I'm always wondering what I'm waiting for, what's the point? I love my family and they love me but why can't they see that I'm so worthless and broken that it's time to let go."
I miss my bruises,6,mllgu2,0,"I used to be in a sport in which getting bruises, and sometimes injuries, were common. When I was first starting out, I’d get a lot of bruises. My wrist would be covered with bruises. I’d come home from 5 hour afterschool practices exhausted, worn out, and starving. I’d get bruises on my wrists, my legs, knees, sometimes even my nose. Once, I got a small bruise on my lip and eye. I’m no longer in that sport, and I miss it. I miss feeling like crap after practices; I miss unknowingly going hours without eating and coming home with a new bruise that would last a week. Those bruises at least kept me interested. It would look different with every passing day; maybe I’d wake up and it’d be darker or lighter, or maybe the color would become more purple. I don’t get bruises as easily anymore and I miss it. I don’t even know why I was so infatuated with having and getting bruises, but I miss them. It’s so stupid."
Loneliness is more than just being single,15,mlf172,6,"I’m 30 years old and feel like the older I get, the more disconnected from people I feel. Hanging out and talking to people doesn’t feel really fun as much. I don’t really have a sense of belong anywhere, childhood friends are all doing their own thing and the friends I made later in life feel transient. Everybody seems to have their established group n for me it’s trying to figure out how I can squeeze in. For some time being online on Twitter helped me find and make friends but now I feel even isolated there. Whenever the topic of being lonely as an adult comes up people assume it’s because I’m single. I have no problem trying to date and find somebody, but when I go on the apps, some people are very weird, clingy n gross for my liking lol....I just want somebody who’s fun to talk to and makes the mundane things in life more fun. I feel like that can be accomplished by so much more than just a romantic partner. Maybe it’s because I come from an immigrant background and my parents had huge communities and groups where families helped each other and other time it feels like we don’t have those bonds anymore. Sort of feels like the overworking/competition culture just makes it so hard to genuinely form bonds with others"

How did this happen?,2,mlqg25,0,"For the first time in my life, I find myself having ""passive"" suicidal thoughts.  A slow-burning apathy has taken over, a shift in mindset toward the all-too-logical realization that it literally would not make a difference to me if I did not wake up tomorrow. You cannot miss what you do not have. 

I do not want to hurt myself, nor do I feel as though I would be better off dead.  I simply now perceive a quietness in death. The only reason I cringe at the thought is because I know my family would be devastated. I truly feel if no one in my immediate family were alive, I would not care if I woke up or not. 

The spooky (or not spooky?) thing about it is that while I recognize this is a change in thinking, I do I not care. It makes me wonder if ""this is how it starts..."" for people who become seriously ill. I know no one goes from 100% to shit overnight, for most it is a slow burn and that makes me worried about what's next.

I want to blame how I was born for the way I am but I do not know if I can. I do not know if it is my own failure or natural selection that will wipe me off this earth eventually but I know at the very least that something will.
Some things I can’t blame myself for, like my ADHD, my gender identity and my fucking disgusting dwarf height of 5’2. I hate how these things make me even weaker, I hate how I can’t do anything about them EVER and even if I someday will get over my depression I will always be weak because I was born weak.
I hate that my only talent is visual art which I know will never ever help me earn a living because I live in a small country where the people do not appreciate art and I would most likely never be able to even be good enough to stand out. It’s just a useless trait in me that can maybe earn me a few compliments but I would rather trade it for academic success so maybe I could one day pursue the career that I want to and live the life that I still have enough energy to dream for.
My father deserved a better son than I am. I love my father with all my heart but I am so scared that he will pass away before I can somehow show him how I admire him and can only dream to one day be the man that he is.

I am very emotionally intelligent so for the last few years while I’ve felt down, I’ve managed quite well to overcome my struggles.

Help. I read my 10 year old sisters diary and found at she is suicidal. [SERIOUS],429,mksro9,44,"I know, i know. But before you trash me for reading her diary, i have to say she left it on my bed i guess by accident? And i had no idea it was her diary till i read it. What i found was that she thinks her family hates her because she has bad grades and she also talks about body image problems. To be clear, our family does not hate her,  but she does always cause trouble which means that she usually gets grounded. The big thing i found was a direct quote ""sometimes i wonder if it would make a difference if i was dead"". I dont know what to do from here. Should i tell her i read her diary and talk to her about it? Would that make it worse? Should i continue to read her diary so i can know if shes planing on killer herself? Im worried if i tell her i read her diary it would make her close up more, and itll be worse than before.

At one second...she's so sweet and loving...and the next one she shouts at me how she wants me to die and then she cries and apologises. I can't handle this for too long anymore...going to her is starting to be so painful...I'm not even looking forward to it, as I'm more terrified of it.

&#x200B;

”OK, good luck.“ 

&#x200B;

I’ve suffered with major depression and active suicidal ideation for a long time. I’ve been on and off meds, been through ECT, and talked about hospitalization more than once. Every time I tell a provider that I’m not going to pursue care all I get is “ok, good luck.”   


I get it from the perspective of the provider. If your patient isn’t interested in treatment, forcing it isnt the right move. Also, for the sake of the health of the provider you can’t chase every patient.   


Just once it would be nice to have a provider say “no! You’re in too bad of shape and you need do something. Here are your options...”

Again, I get it. I just wish it was different.   


What have been your experiences with this been?"
Why?,2,mlphxp,0,She was the best thing that ever happened to me and I let her go because I couldn't work through some stupid fucking temporary long distance. I even asked her to get back together and she said she was over me. I feel so empty and I'm the only one to blame for it.
It's sad to think about how I will die alone,2,mlpa4b,0,"I don't have much to say except how sad I think it is that I will die alone, hell I doubt anyone will notice if I am gone. If on the off chance someone did notice they wouldn't even care. I don't blame them, I am a defect of a human, I am meant to be alone. It only takes someone a few hours or maybe a day if I am lucky to see how worthless I am. No talents, no social skills, no stories, no personality, nothing. I haven't felt a real connection with a human in years if I really ever have, it hurts to think I will die completely isolated."

I hope I get diagnosed this time,2,mlp8xn,4,"19F here. This is sort of a throw away account I guess.

I finally booked an appointment for the gp (doctors) today. I told the receptionist that it's to check up on my mental health. I'm going to get a call on Friday. I'm kind of scared. I've always known there was something wrong with me. I think I'm depressed. I also think I have adhd but when I tried to get diagnosed a couple of years ago, they dismissed me because *I* was the one who thought I had adhd (as opposed to someone else like a parent or teacher which is so stupid because only I know what's going on in my head but apparently my own concern is not enough to be taken seriously 🙄) That's made me distrust doctors so I'm kind of worried they won't take me seriously again. 

I really hope I get diagnosed so that I can get treated. I hate where I am in life right now and I really wanna get better. It really sucks when you know something is wrong with you but other people don't believe you."
Too sad,2,mlp34n,0,"I feel like most days I’m on autopilot. I can’t do anything right. I’m a terrible mom, a terrible friend, terrible girlfriend.

My body hurts all day every day because of all the stupid illnesses I tacked on after my second child was born. I’m hurting in all of the way. I used to be fit af, but gained 30 pounds during covid. 

I don’t want to be here. I’ve been thinking about it for two months, but it just gets stronger every day. I am lonely even with people. I don’t think I can be fixed. If I feel this way at 30, how will I feel at 50? 60? I didn’t think I’d be here this long, but here I am... still miserable."
Afraid of emotions,2,mloxcy,0,"I have had high-functioning depression (hate that term but whatever) for a long time now, I don't feel intense sadness or suicidal thoughts, I just feel empty and purposeless all the time, like a living corpse. After working on it with a psychiatrist and making some lifestyle changes, I'm feeling much better, but I still felt like there is a missing link that I'm not grasping.

And then something happened today, and it made me angry - so angry that it surprised myself, because I have not felt such an intense emotion for so long, and I didn't even know how to handle it. I realized that because that constant emptiness has dominated my life for so long, I kinda forgot how to deal with emotions.

It's kind of scary though. Now that I'm aware of my emotions I will need to learn how to express and release them. But I feel like I would look foolish or childish. It doesn't help that I always try not be a burden for other people. I already feel guilty when I talk about my mental health to my friends…

I feel like I am a shall of what I once was and I can't even find something to be happy about, the girl I love seems to not really care about me, or us as in a relationship. It feels like no matter how much effort and time I try to put into something it will inevitably fail,  like it did so many times before. I can hardly see a point to it anymore but I keep pushing,  I am telling myself that everything is okay when I can't help but feel the opposite thing every single night.

How did you open up to your parents about your mental issues?,3,mlkqno,2,"Everyday it's getting harder to get out of bed, dress up, shower, smile, etc. I don't feel anything other than pain and anger anymore, I don't remember the last time I was really happy or excited about something.

I have really serious suicidal thoughts, I even planned how I would do it and had dreamed about it several times but I'm trying to stop myself everytime by thinking about my family and friends. 

I have really supportive family and friends but I don't want to upset them by opening up, I once tried to tell them that I was not okay but they thought it was some teenager stuff and I couldn't tell them how serious it was and I had been sufferring for the last 4 years of my life. 

I don't know if I'm depressed or have any other mental issues, I've never seen a physiciatrist (I hope it's the right word, English is not my main language) in my life but I know that I'm in pain and I need help, I just don't know how to talk to them.

I don't know how to tell my family that their daughter they do everything for wants to kill herself, is in constant pain and falls asleep crying every night. I'm scared that they won't take me seriously even though they are normally really supportive parents, I'm scared to upset them, I'm scared to disappoint them but at the same time I don't want to die but this urge inside me is getting much more powerful everyday.

Long rant/venting (should I apply for disability?),2,mlnkvy,0,"Ive been bouncing between family members homes and Im tempted to just live out of my car. I just moved to Wisconsin into my dad's house because I thought him and my step mom would be more supportive.

I got and lost a job in just 4 days and I'm at a very low point. I've been researching psychiatrists and found an inpatient program, and I'm getting on my dad's insurance in the next 10 days. I just want to wait until I can make a psych appointment before I get another job and ruin that. Both my dad and step mom are down my throat about getting another job asap and to get out of my room. I lost my job just yesterday. A couple of minutes ago I was doing dishes and thinking about going for a walk when my step mom started yelling about how I have to get out of my room and go for a walk and if I kill myself then I'm going to hell (which I don't believe in). For some reason her telling me to do what I was already planning on doing just makes me want to stay in my room. 

I'm 19 and just lost my 10th job. No matter how hard I try I always end up having an anxiety attack and walking out. I don't know what to do anymore but I feel terrible living with family even if I'm paying rent and everyone just makes me feel more alone. My dad doesn't want me to even consider an inpatient program. I think it might be a good idea since I've been this depressed for a long time. I'm going on his insurance so I don't know if he has a say. I keep losing jobs so I definitely can't move out on my own.

If I get a job I end up keeping it'll have to be minimum wage to qualify for low income housing, or I'll have to make $18 an hour (high income when I'm not qualified for anything) to be able to afford a cheap apartment and all my bills by myself. I also know it's a long process to apply for disability and even then I could be denied. I have ADHD, PTSD, severe major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder with panic attacks all diagnosed by my psychiatrist from my last state, but I'm not sure if I should attempt to get disability. Everything just seems like a lost cause."
Spaced Out,2,mlnjg9,1,"I can't focus on anything even videogames or YouTube videos. I don't have hobbies, because I don't care about my mental or physical health. My memory is shit and I feel like an idiot when I can't remember something like my age. I'm on 5 meds and all they do is put a band aid on the wound; it doesn't bring me back to a time where I was ignorant of how cruel life can be. Sometimes I just sit and stare at the trees outside and remember all the shit that people have done to me. I want to either sleep or eat junk food or struggle to watch a funny YouTuber, but I end up sad or crying. I think about how life is meaningless and I've been dealt a bad hand. My therapist and doctor said I should consider disability. I'm tired and sad and it just makes normal people things harder."
I wonder how it feels like to borned good looking/rich,8,mlchh9,1,"Lets face it. Looks and money are everything. Everything is so easy when you are goodlooking or rich. More friends, more respect, more girls, even the probability of getting a job is higher if you are good looking, in fact not just a job but getting what you want. Im sick and tired of seeing kpop stars and rich and good looking people posting and crying on social media 'im so depressed' bs. You dont know what its like to be at the bottom to be like us. If my life was like theirs, i would never ever get depressed."

How to diagnose depression,2,mlnayl,1,"I haven't been able to concentrate on my work lately. And many a time I don't even feel like watching YouTube or scrolling through social media.
My sleeping cycle and appetite has become irregular and I feel sleepy almost the entire day.

It seems that I have all the symptoms for mild depression but I feel it could just be the lockdown blues or effects of addiction to social media and youtube 
How to diagnose for the cause? I don't feel like paying a buckload of money for therapy since I am not sure whether I need one in the first place"
It's gotten to the point where there is not a single thing in life I enjoy.,115,mkywpi,36,"99.9% of everything I do bores the living shit outta me at best or is a tedious chore at worst. Novels, movies, series, Internet, YouTube... you name it. It probably bores me to tears. I'm so bored, it's excruciating. Every second of everyday I stare at a blank screen or the walls or the ceiling. I desperately try to find something to pull me out of this agonizing ennui. It rarely works. 

I think I'm terminally bored at this point. Life sucks. Everything sucks. I hate everything about life. There is genuinely not a single thing that makes life worth living. All I feel everyday is the inevitable march to the slaughterhouse. And I'm not scared. I'm just... bored and so underwhelmed. Sometimes bitterly disappointed. Sometimes angry. But mostly just bored out of my goddamn mind."
Knock knock,5,mli2wr,0,Hello darkness my dear friend
Recovery is expensive...,3,mln21o,1,I know at this point the only way I'll get better is with extensive therapy and medication and honestly probably a long stint in a psych ward. But of course I don't have health insurance and can't afford it...which leaves me shit outta luck. It's hard to want to even try to get better when I feel like I'm staring down a tsunami with a tin buck in my hands. At this point I'd really rather just drown
I'm at a breaking point and no advice or efforts seem to work anymore. I'm so scared.,3,mlk1d1,1,"I don't know where to begin with this post.

I'm 19 and finishing up my senior year of high school. **I redid my junior year** due to mental health issues (got hospitalized in 2019). At the time the issues were severe OCD and social anxiety. Those don't seem to be my issues currently. I've been depressed pretty much my whole life, even as a child. Usually, it's the type of depression that makes me numb, cry in bed and contemplate suicide, which is why I'm unsure if I'm actually depressed right now or if it's something else.

**I have no energy to do anything anymore.** I went from being a straight-A student my whole life to failing everything. I'm scared I won't graduate. I believe the reason for my change in grades is because the only thing fueling my A's in the past was severe anxiety, fear of what my teachers would do if I didn't do everything perfectly and on time. Ever since my severe mental breakdown in 2019, this fear has vanished. So I have no motivator to get me through schoolwork. **Even the fear of homelessness doesn't motivate me**, and I truly believe that if that doesn't motivate me, nothing will. (My parents seriously threatened to send me to a shelter a year ago, as soon as I turned 18.)

Speaking of 2019, I feel like something permanently broke in my brain. I went nonverbal nearly the entire year, screamed at the top of my lungs if my parents tried to talk to me, hid in my bedroom closet, ripped my hair out, etc. **I feel like I have permanent brain damage** from this but my therapist just laughed when I told her, which didn't help. I'm much better now in many ways than I was in 2019. Quarantine helped. But one thing got worse: my energy. It's gone. That's why I feel I'm broken.

I got **blood tested** for *hundreds* of different things -- not even a hyperbole. All my hormones, any possible deficiency possible (the list was endless), organ function, even celiac disease. Every single thing came back normal. I told myself that if they didn't find a problem in my blood test, that I would commit suicide because I'm a lost cause. Unfortunately, I'm too scared to do that.

I've had ADHD since I was a little kid (or since I was born, I guess). I didn't realize it was ADHD until a year ago. I got medicated. None of the different meds I tried helped much and none of them solve my energy problem. **So it's not the ADHD**, especially since I didn't have this energy problem as a kid**.** I've been prescribed different **antidepressants** over the years but I've had severe reactions to all of them. One (wellbutrin) even caused a terrifying psychotic break that resulted in PTSD. I'm likely bipolar, which would explain the reactions, but I haven't had any episodes as of late so I'm waiting on that. Doctors always scoff at me when I suggest an illness anyways.

**Let's talk about the internet.** The internet has slowly destroyed me since middle school. I know it's at least partially responsible for my issues, and it has only gotten worse because I have absolutely **no friends** anymore and I use it to cope. It's *destroyed* my attention span, gives me instant gratification, laziness, increased anger issues, etc. But I can't figure out how to stop. **All of my schoolwork is online**. I actually have an IEP so I might be able to have my in-person teacher make physical paper copies of my schoolwork, but that won't solve everything since two of my classes are on VLACS (an online school). I spend all day rotating between Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, and Netflix. I've deactivated my Twitter account many times but I always reactivate it. I've tried using website blockers but I always turn them off.

I feel so **humiliated** and alone. My relationship with my family is shit, with my teachers is shit, I have no friends, my therapist isn't helpful, I don't have a job, I don't have a license (but I'm getting better at driving every day, so there's that), and my school case manager is getting annoyed with me. I stay in my room all day, other than to go for a walk outside. **I'm too tired to get out of bed** even though I set up a desk in my room to do schoolwork. Even just moving to my desk is exhausting.

I've been increasing my physical **exercise** this year **but it hasn't changed anything.** I could definitely work on exercising a lot more though, but I'm scared it'll just make me even more tired. I always make sure to eat more and take in more protein after exercising, too.

I forgot to mention this, but **I'm diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder**, which honest to God is a death sentence. If you don't know what that is, it's more than just ""social anxiety on steroids."" It's a severe avoidance of *everything* in life, and there are no therapists in my area who treat it. Even my own therapist didn't know what it was.

I don't know what's happening to me and I'm so scared. I know this was a long post but if anyone has any advice, *please* reply."
Went to a doctor for the first time in 15 years,39,ml4vr9,15,"And what a mistake that was. Nothing I said was taken seriously. Apparently abdominal pain and trouble peeing isn't cause for concern, I couldn't possibly need a blood test at 27, and he can't direct me anywhere useful for mental health. I've been so terrified of trying to get help for years and I felt so ashamed asking him all these things and it turns out no one gives a shit anyway. All this time I thought that help was out there and I just needed to overcome the anxiety and depression to ask. But I guess there's no fixing my life. Back into my hole I go."
Wanting to cancel my covid vaccine appointment,2,mlmzzd,4,"This is really stupid and would just have me continue to put other people at risk by being unvaccinated. I know that. I just need someone to slap that sense into me. 

I have my first dose of the COVID vaccine scheduled for Thursday morning and I want to cancel it because
 a) it sounds exhausting and stressful to get up and go
b) I'm a horrible person who doesn't deserve to be vaccinated. Other people deserve it much more and I don't want to waste a much-needed vaccine"

I take lithium 1200 mg and cipralex 20 mg. Apparently taking lithium at such a young age isn't normal. My dad's psychiatrist was shocked to hear it. I hate the pills. They're big and hard to swallow, sometimes it feels like they're stuck in my throat.

My life isn't even that bad. I don't have any trauma, understanding parents, and a decent financial situation. So why do I feel like killing myself. It makes me feel as if im sad for stupid reasons.

I hate opening up, which is bad cause i see a psychiatrist and two social workers. I fucking hate it. They keep prodding for information."
Sometimes I feel better for a week and that's the worst part,8,mldhkz,5,"It just puts in perspective how miserable I an the rest of the time and how miserable the rest of my life is going to be.

anyways. when i was 14 in autumn of 2019, i started talking to this girl in my year that recently pulled out of school and we ended up in a relationship blah blah blah. she broke up with me when i got to my dads (out of town) after my grandads funeral and things haven’t been good since. it feels like i changed who i am for her and i can’t go back to who i used to be. i’ve tried not dating and also dating but nothing works. every word of every song i listen to brings back memories of sneaking out to go to her place. we didn’t even do anything we just cuddled and it’s the slow, simple things that i miss. we barely even kissed  a lot. i don’t even know why i’m writing this. it seems pointless. i just hope someone out there can help out. i’m hopeless and i just don’t see a way out.


yes i have told her how i feel etc etc but to not avail. she moved on a week or two after we broke up as well which i guess what a year of a relationship with me does. sorry for rambling"
Every Second that goes by is another second that I let someone down,1,mlr00a,0,"Every moment that I sit with myself in pain and sadness is another moment that I let someone I love down.

melancholy,1,mlqzhh,0,"i wouldn’t ever downplay anyone’s struggles, especially when it comes to suffering mental illness. but sometimes i envy those who have situational depression.. you know like the people who suffer “depression” because of a culmination of bad luck and less than ideal lifestyles.

because i don’t have a lot to complain about, but for some reason i have an aching pit in my chest and a silent, empty brain. i don’t know where my will to live went. i used to dream about my future but i don’t even know how to feel better at this point. i just feel like having crying spells all day, while at the same time i am screaming at myself in my head “WHY CAN’T YOU JUST BE HAPPY” i feel lifeless, dull, lost.

and the worst part is i don’t even feel like i deserve to feel this bad, but i literally. can’t. help. it."
First ever crush making me go insane,1,mljkha,3,"I’m 23 F and never been in a relo, never liked a guy and am a virgin. I was questioning whether I was asexual but a few months ago, for the first time ever, a guy I had an Internet crush on wanted to be friends irl and now i have a rl crush on him (probably bordering on manic infatuation by now).

I had no idea having an unreciprocated crush would drive me this insane..

(Obvs I’m in this forum for a reason and I have a bunch of mental illnesses + my life in general is miserable). So having to deal w these new feelings in this new situation has made my mental instability go off the rails. 

Me and him get along so well, talk everyday, have so many niche shared interests, same humour etc; it literally feels like we’re the same person. Yet I’ve never felt more subtly rejected by a guy ever. He doesn’t even platonically flirt w me and I do that w everybody!!!! I’ve been feeling extremely insecure, hideous, lame + anxious bc of him. I keep getting upset by little things like late replies or when he doesn’t invite me somewhere etc (but I keep that to myself). He hasn’t done anything wrong it’s just ME being unable to cope w the fact that I’m being friendzoned by the only guy I’ve ever liked in my life... 

I def have attachment issues and Im starting to think I have bpd honestly. I can’t stop thinking/fantasising about him and psychoanalysing everything it’s just so weird I’m even feeling like this what the hell ???!! God I just feel so sad cos it feels like I can’t have anything in this life

Edit: I keep spiralling and thinking it’s my looks. It’s gotta be my looks. If I was prettier he’d probably have made a move by now. But maybe that’s not the case. I really should just tell him but I don’t wanna make things weird between us. Tbh I need to just move the fuck on but I’ve literally never moved on from anything in my life lol"
Why am I not getting better?,1,mlqx9x,0,"I’m struggling. Bad. I can’t get out of bed nor can I sleep. I spend all my time watching tv for escapism and I can tell it’s really grating on my boyfriend.

I am a female stalker,1,mlqwhj,2,"

Don’t even know what I’m looking for or why I’m posting but comment whatever you like, if you feel like it. Maybe someone has some insight because none of the therapy I’ve been in has helped much. 

I’m a woman in her early 20s. A couple years ago I became extremely obsessed (not primarily sexually though eventually it did become a romantic obsession) with a teacher of mine who was in his late 50s, married with children. He didn’t do anything to encourage me but he was really nice to me and we had things in common. I think he enjoyed my company too at least at first but obviously not as much as I did. I became totally obsessed, but knew it was immoral to do anything. I cried over him and dreamt of him and thought of him 90 percent of my waking hours. And long story short eventually became so obsessed that I would search the trash for things he’d thrown out. I  memorized his schedule and would try to bump into him. I misinterpreted some things and stupidly thought he felt the same about me. I looked everywhere for proof that he cared about me, even going through his papers in his office once. I looked at photos of his family and him every day. I tried to distance myself but even in another state after a year apart i thought of him every day. 

I’ve tried therapy and it helped some but I still cry sometimes, like tonight. I feel so angry and disgusted with myself because I know this is wrong but I want to google him and see his picture. I feel like my head is on fire, 5 years later. I haven’t spoken to him in over a year and we aren’t even real friends. He’s just being nice. He’s probably creeped out by me. I hate myself I just want him. I hate my brain. I feel like a baby that just wants it’s mother.... I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why therapy isn’t helping. I’m sure it’s my own fault but I can’t do this anymore."
I feel completely useless,1,mlqvpe,0,"I’m an autistic teenager (don’t remember exactly where I am on the spectrum) and I just don’t feel like I can do anything right. Because of my Autism, I have an immensely hard difficulty with improving at anything. I’ve tried for years to become a better drawer, but my skills have stayed relatively the same for years. (And they aren’t even that high) Every new hobby I try, I suck at, no matter how much time and effort I put into it, and because I suck at it, I don’t enjoy that hobby and only get a feeling of uselessness. I don’t have a job or any friends because my Autism makes me extremely introverted and anti-social, (which is another thing I’ve tried and failed to change) I’m fat because I’m too depressed to work out, and I have constant headaches because of all of the stress. I feel like everything I do, I fail at, and even if I put years of effort in, I never improve. I don’t feel suicidal, but I feel like my life is worthless and that the world would literally be better off if I didn’t exist to consume resources. What should I do?"
Thinking of checking out,1,mlquny,4,"I've suffered with depression for about 16 years now. My husband brushes it off and doesn't choose to engage when I try to talk to him. I've always been nervous to actually ""take a rest,"" in a place because of the stigma. I spend most days in bed if I don't have work and can't bring myself to enjoy much anymore. It's been a long time coming. Has anyone checked into a mental health inpatient program and had good results?"

Tomorrow I go to the dentist and find out what the damage is.,1,mlqi8a,0,"I finally made an appointment to see what damage I've done due to my depression habit of not regularly brushing or flossing. That's very vague of me. Here's the truth: I brushed once a week and flossed once a month since the pandemic hit. I feel so ashamed of myself.

And I'm feeling like such a fool. My dental insurance only covers emergency surgery and I can't afford to have cavities taken care of, so I will be going into medical debt if I am not immensely lucky and scrape by cavity free. My anxiety is high as well as a result. But that's another matter.

I set alarms today to brush twice and floss once. I managed to do it, mostly because of how scared I am. But I certainly haven't undone whatever my oral hygiene looks like overall. Tomorrow I'll try to brush in the morning again then before my appointment I'll try to brush and floss.

No matter what I need to get a handle on my self-care habits. I only shower once a week. And it takes so much out of me. I need to figure out a way to manage to brush, floss, and shower regularly. I wonder if I'd feel less depressed if I found a way to take better care of myself.

I'm in treatment and on medication, but I still struggle with basics. I'm not even in a larger bout of depression at the moment. It's there but not as bad as it could be. I think that's why my prescriber and counselor aren't pushing for more changes.

I'm open to suggestions or encouragement, for sure. Thank you for taking the time to read.

TL;DR: I go to the dentist tomorrow to see what damage I've done by not taking care of my oral hygiene due to depression. Feeling ashamed, foolish, and scared."

As if my life couldn't get any worse (Long),2,mllnd2,2,"49 year old guy. Never been in a relationship with a man nor women. Hooked up with anonymous guys when I was in my 30's but that wore off within a few years. Other than that the only person I had ever messed around with in that way was a friend from childhood, John, who I met at age 10. This went on from about 16 until my late 20's.  Unfortunately he apparently saw it as more than simply friends with benefits which is why I had to stop engaging in that with him as it ****ruined our friendship. There is an entire story there but I will leave that for another time. Anyway I am still 'friends' with him although its sort of more out of routine than wanting to actually associate with him. He just stresses me out all the time including lying alot.  However I do think in some twisted way even 20 years later he see's our friendship as more than what it is and was even though I put out the total opposite vibe.

I have never told anyone in my family or social circles about any sexual or romantic or there-lack of aspects of my life as it applies to John or in general. All they know is that John is a friend since childhood.

I have almost no social circle aside from a couple of other normal friends. One of them I talk to about once every couple of months and the other maybe once a week and occasionally go out to eat. Used to hang out with them alot during the late 90's and early 2000's.

My family circle consists of my mother, my brother who I am not close with but talk to and see occasionally and his wife who I will call Laura and who I only tolerate as she is a busybody knowitall who is also into all sorts of conspiracy shit and loves ramming her opinions and views down other peoples throats.

Anyway, apparently my friend John has been messaging Laura on Facebook in recent months even though they were never actually friends in real life. Not sure who started messaging who or why although in a recent text conversation I had with John he said she has been bothering him about cannabis. She is also into pot and CBD and thinks its a cure all for everything and likes to talk about it.I told John to just tell her he is not interested in discussing it and stop bothering him with it. So at that point I assumed that was that.

Well today suddenly Laura messaged my mother on Facebook and asked what is going on between me and John. Of course my mother had no idea what she meant. Laura went on to say that John seemed to be saying stuff that led her to think he was was obsessed with me and said that can be interpreted as, to use the word she used, ""mushy"".

Now John is a weird guy in general and is not the brightest bulb in the lamp but I can't imagine what he said that she thought was ""mushy"" but I am royally pissed off at him and for that matter her about the whole thing. I don't need more crap in my life. I have enough stress. Anyway John apparently talked to her about more than just pot. Honestly Laura probably dug at him to find out more about me and he was not smart enough to watch what he said. Again as I said she is a busybody. Now I do not think he actually went into detail but I suspect it was more about his tone when referring to me, enough so that it raised a flag for her.

I plan to get in touch with John tonight to find out what the hell is going on and I also am going to end the friendship. He already stresses me out and now THIS. He really screwed me over. I want nothing to do with him anymore. But he has forever left this new dark cloud over my head by not being able to keep personal shit about me and him to himself, especially when talking to people who are also part of my social or family circle."
Can't get out of my car and go into work.,2,mlll7b,2,"Sitting in the car in the carpark outside work.

It's like I can't breathe."
I wish I had died that night,2,mllklw,0,"6 years ago I had an illness I wasn't aware I had. I don't want to get into the illness right now, but I had really bad vertigo-like symptoms and I had been throwing up every day for about two weeks.

Even though I live in a courty with free healthcare, I've always had a mentality that the hospital should be the last resort. I can tough it out until I get better. I was convinced it was just a flu. Finally enough people close to me convinced me to go.

As soon as I get to the ER, I told the lady at reception my symptoms and before I know it I'm being rushed to a bed and I have IV's sticking out of me, a heart monitor attached and nurses taking blood samples at a very alarming rate. In all my years I've never been whisked away in the ER like that. I always have to wait like 4 hours to see anybody.

I finally talk to a doctor after a few hours of laying there, and he tells me if I had waited even one more day to go to the hospital, I would have died. Those words have haunted me every day since.

I forget how long I was in the hospital in total, about a week I think. It was really tough mentally. I cried every single night, and had more thoughts of suicide than I ever had in my life combined.

My then girlfriend would come see me every day after work, and she wouldn't leave until they kicked all the visitors out for the night. We were so in love then.. She would hold me in my bed and tell me everything was going to be okay. When I started to regain my strength we would hold hands and go for walks around the hospital together. I sincerely believe the reason I survived was because I had her.

Fast forward to today, and I'm medically okay. I've recovered fully, and am syptom free, but my life has done nothing but go downhill since then.

My girlfriend and I were together over a decade before she left me for another man. I have no friends anymore, just a couple of pen pals, I have no family. I owned the business of my dreams, and now I'm unemployed going on a year.

If I had died then, I would have died happy, in love, surrounded by people who cared a out me, and with so much potential

I survived, but for what?"
"I can't go a day without thinking/saying ""I hate my life""",1,mlq8t6,0,"I recently released from the army to focus on college mostly because of mental health issues and inconvenient timings that don't blend well with my college schedule. The army felt like it made up so much of my identity that I don't know who I am without it. I think about the good times that I had but also the much shittier times. Both are hard to think about and it makes me really sad every day. Combined with the daily grind of college, it is really just taking a toll on my mental health.

Positives I guess is alcohol is at an all time low cost but I don’t drink anymore, internet and technology stuff is cheap all around, internet is pretty sweet, food options are good and tasty, porn is better than ever but that’s probably about it."
I’m getting nowhere in life,23,ml6cfk,5,"I’m 23 and I’ve done absolutely nothing with my life. Others my age have graduated from college, are attending grad school, moving in with their significant other, traveling, working a steady job, etc. I’m in the same place I was 5+ years ago, mentally, physically & emotionally. I’m still in college but I’m too dumb for it, I’m unemployed, the very few social skills I have are gone, I haven’t matured yet, I’m irresponsible, I don’t know how to do anything on my own, I lack common sense, I’m just incompetent at life. Apart from being incompetent and a dumbass, I’m also very ugly. I have this idea engraved in my head that the only way my life will improve is if I become good looking. I just feel like an overall failure, I’ve wasted so much time. I’ve lost the little motivation I had, I don’t even want to finish college anymore, I just want to give up. I wish I could move to the middle of nowhere, and never have to face anyone or anything again. I’m afraid I’ll be like this forever... ugly, dumb, and awkward. I hate myself so much. Every year it gets worse and worse, I wish I had a do over. I just wish I wasn’t me."
Lost,2,mllic6,1,I have literally no interest in anything whatsoever. I cry sometimes maybe once a week but not suicidal as such and not really sad just so numb that nothing interests me at all. The past week I’ve sat in my chair all day everyday and done nothing all day because everything seems so pointless. I also have no friends or social life.
"I doubt I'll finish high school and I'm strangely fine with that, which worries me",1,mlq4f9,0,"Senior high school student here who's been having trouble with classes. I used to be a genius at school, I won so many awards back then in elementary school and I went to a high school for the ""super talented students"". I was pretty average compared to my peers but it wasn't a big deal to me since we were all intelligent in one way or another. But in the previous school year things went downhill fast. My depression which has shown signs back in elementary school has gotten very bad to the point that I'm barely able to keep up with studies. This school year I just cheat on pretty much everything by copying my classmate's works, from essays to math outputs. It has become pretty hard for me to retain information and focus on things. Recently a teacher made an announcement regarding how there's some cheating going on and that all people involved will be marked as zero. I'm guessing this is because I cheated on this activity where we're supposed to write a reflection talking about how this week in school went and what we learned in her subject. I can barely write anything cause I don't even study anymore and I just do less than the bare minimum.  


I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean but I can't even be bothered to save myself or struggle against the waves. I miss my old self who would at least try to succeed in school. I miss when I used to have ambitions in life and I wasn't just making decisions based on what would make me the least miserable in that moment. I miss when I wasn't a failure."
Why do I try,2,mlleh8,0,"Why do I try anymore, I will always be a loser. I have not a single skill, not a single strong suit, and not a single thing I am halfway competent at. I am such a fucking worthless waste of space, such a pathetic piece of shit who will never amount to anything. Why am I even alive right now, all I am doing is wasting food and air that would be better used to on wild animals than me. 

No one will miss me when I am gone, no family, none of my nonexistent friends, nobody. I honestly don't get why I have no killed myself when I live everyday in pain with no hope of getting better. I can't keep living, it is hell to live everyday with constant anxiety and self hatred, I fucking despise myself. It gets so bad my chest tightens so much it can hurt. 

I wish I could just press a button and die or be able to just euthanize myself. Since that sadly isn't an option I guess I will have to wait until I stop being a fucking baby and just end it. My body would probably rot for weeks before anyone notices, its funny and sad to think about that."
I always try not to show who I really am because I am a piece of shit,2,mlldqq,2,"I am seriously SO toxic, needy and abusive, I hate myself and who I really am, but I always try my best not to show it to people and treat them as nice as possible everytime. 

I won't even try to have kids, they don't deserve a parent like me, nobody does. I don't want to be lonely but I don't deserve anyone, and I don't want to hurt anyone.

I don't know what I would do if I fall in love with someone. It will surely hurt but I don't think I can be with anyone. I am immature.

I hate being so isolated but it's the best thing for everyone, I think.

how do i tell my parent(s) im depressed and suicidal?,2,mllau9,1,"Im turning 19 and i hopefully will be graduating in a few months from high school. I say hopefully because ive really been low functioning since covid happened and my parents are only getting angrier and more disappointed with me now that Im becoming the opposite of what I used to be. 

I just wanted to ask how you know if it's the right time to tell them? Im really itching to tell them right now cause we just had a big fight but they probably wont listen to me because of this. 

Should I tell them about my cutting and suicidal plans/ideation? 

How do I approach them?

Im usually bad with words but my mom probably wont let me give her a page with my writing on it since i already tried doing that when i wanted to quit the IB program (it's like AP in the US and A-levels in the UK).

We're low income and have language barriers as Asian immigrants living in Europe so we probably cant afford professional help. I regret not asking my school counselor before spring break on how i should tell my parents so im asking you guys : ) thank you if your read through this. To understand my full context, you can read more from my past post."

That Feeling of Isolation,2,mll64m,1,"Does anyone ever get that feeling of isolation? When you try to be open about your struggle with Mental Health -- especially with those closest to you -- but you feel a bit of backlash that all you do is identify with depression and that you are just burdening people around you with your negative energy. I mean I try the best I can to put my outlet in other things to try to let out the steam and not on my relationships, but shit, sometimes you just want to talk to another human being. But then you're only faced with shame feeling like you overshared and all you should do is bottle everything up inside again -- the very same habit that brought you here in the first place. This sucks."
I wish other people’s words didn’t affect me so much,7,mlc3q0,1,"I feel like the little things that people say hurt me more than they should.

"When You’ve Been Depressed For So Long, Your Entire Personality and Mindset is Depressive",71,mkzj6d,8,"Been depressed since 11, but I’d still have up periods intermittently that’s last 2 weeks or so. Now as a 20 year old depression is my outlook, it’s rooted in my sub conscious. I get asked anything, the answer is gonna be negative and dismissive.  Any bump in the road, I call it quits. 


I’m not depressed currently, because I want to change, but my mentality is scarred from depression, so I use the same mechanisms of a depressed person to navigate the day.  *sigh*

There’s no career or major i care about so much that i’d want to do it for the rest of my life. My teenage years have been a complete waste and the most significant thing in these years has been getting my period at the beginning of 6th grade. I’ve never been in a relationship nor has anyone liked me for more than a week (seems like anyone i talk to ends up finding me annoying), though all of my friends are in relationships, have been in one, or just don’t want one. I doubt I’ll manage to ever find someone who’d want to be with me since I’m emotionally unstable and have no plans for the future. I suck and I’m tired of everything."

Tonight IFU by re-reading old emails from my mother (deceased),1,mlpluq,0,"My mom and I were extremely close. She was my best friend. She passed away in 2009 at the age of 49 rather suddenly. Tonight I was going through my old email account to save what I wanted to save so I could delete the account since I no longer use it. I saw an email from my mom from the week before she passed. This led me to read ALL of our emails. Some good. Some not so good (while we got along great, we were both fighting our own personal battles at the time too, and that was hard to read). 

Anyways, two hours and dozens of emails later, I'm in really depressive funk. 

I don't really have a question or anything. I'm just alone at the moment and needed to talk about it. It's been 12 years and it still hurts."
I hated going to sleep but I also love to stay asleep,162,mku7vc,15,"I just hate it that everytime I am about to fall asleep all these negative thoughts and emotions just keep on gushing out of my brain. To the point that I am almost hallucinating like my brain is making me relieve all the things that I hate about my past or what kind of future awaits me. And then when I actually fall asleep i hated the idea of waking up because the same thing will happen when I am about to sleep again.

Because of this my body clock is severely damaged. Like i always wait for my body to become so tired or fatigued that my brain wont have any energy to give me negative thoughts and emotions"

What’s the truth? Please read. Where do I go from here? Am I faking it? What do I do?????,3,mlhhrk,5,"I’m so tired of seeing depression all over the internet. How many people are ACTUALLY depressed? I’ve always been a happy person and I’d always say “I can’t be depressed I hate how people make it a trend my life it’s great. It’s offensive for me to claim I am depressed because there are ACTUAL depressed people dealing with hell” but recently I just feel like shit. I feel like I’m bitching I really do. I’ve tried so much. I take vitamin d daily, I exercise, I am on a keto diet which has been known to be good for your mood, I quit all drugs( never got addicted to anything except weed) I have not smoked in 3-4 months and I don’t want to at least not for a long time. I’m in college, I’m pretty, i have 2 jobs and good money, a great family. I do have an eating disorder, I binge/ starve but my weight is varies from normal, to average to slightly overweight. The thing is I’ve had an eating disorder for 6 years and I was never truly unhappy until recently, so I don’t want to instantly blame my ED. I don’t look overweight since I workout. Like I give myself credit I am not ugly if I am being honest. I have great genetics, physically at least. Like my life is decent. I quit drinking tons of caffeine and energy drinks I only have 2-3 cups of coffee a day. Not addicted to nicotine

Recently I’ve just been so down. But the thing is it’s not all the time, some days I feel GREAT. Like my brain is just filled with good happy energy. It feels weird I’m just like “wow I feel so good I wonder if it will last” like I just had a good line of coke. Then other days I feel dead. I wake up and it’s just like a huge heart ache. I have been crying a lot more recently. Random waves of sadness. Two days ago I spent the whole day crying bawling my eyes out from the pain of sadness I’ve been feeling in my chest. I’ve never been that sad for a whole day in my life. I have randomly gotten sad at the gym and go to the bathroom to cry., idk I take a picture or note every time I cry just to see how often I cry to see how serious I should take this sadness. I enjoy crying. I just want to cry. Idk. I’ve also been cutting my self and I’m stopping that. I don’t do it deep but idk it’s fun sometimes. I have not told anyone I cut. I do it on my legs. I just wish I could wake up eat like a normal person, go to work, go to the gym, lose weight, be happy with my body, go out every now and then, be able to do my homework and just have it be easy. I get life is not easy but it feels so ridiculously hard. It was not like this when I was 14 or 15. It started getting worse by the year. 

I feel like I’m just bitching. Everyone has “depression” nowadays. All I want is to have consistent happy days filled with good energy without obsessing over food. How do I tell if this is real depression or if I am just being a little bitch? I feel like it’s so easy to see someone cut a few times or cry few times a month and be like “yeah they are depressed” like that’s not how it works. My father has serious issues but is in denial. I don’t know what he has , I’m not close with him but he is not normal. He has serious anger issues. Maybe it’s genetic? I don’t know

I don’t necessarily want depression, but I want to officially be diagnosed with it just do I could have a reason for why this is all happening to me and so I could work on fixing it. Of course I wish I could just be a normal person, I just want to be diagnosed with SOMETHING just so I could have a reason for all this crap and so I could work on fixing it whether it’s medication or therapy idc. I don’t have time to go to a doctor I work a lot for my family and school. How do I tell if this is real or if I am just bitching? Is life supposed to be this hard???? I don’t know what to do anymore?! Everyone claims to be depressed nowadays what if I’m just one of those people????? Please help I’m so tired of this. Is this the beginning stage? Will it get worse?"

I ran u away, i see all the mistakes I've make, i see what i took for granted, and for that. Maybe i deserve to be alone, because no matter how hard i try i always fuck up in life. I see that instead of relying on u for happiness, i could've make myself happy, but i was alone for so long that i didn't know what to feel, how to feel. Emotionally i was confused about u.

How do you deal with depression in quarantine?,1,mlp4hx,2,When i was younger i was fine with being alone all the time at home. Now all i think about it dying and negative thoughts and stress. There’s no fun in my life at all.

I’ve been in therapy for 2+ years learning about myself, unpacking trauma, and of course learning how to cope with my depression and anxiety. I feel like I’ve tried to be happy and present in my life — but nothing works and when it’s all said and done I still feel worthless and alone. I don’t feel heard, seen, or valued by anyone in my life. I don’t feel like it would make a difference if I was here or not — the world is going to keep spinning regardless. It’s getting incredibly hard to see the point in any of this.

I’m in university and I thought I would be graduating in the winter semester of 2021 but today I found out I won’t be graduating until spring 2022. I feel like a failure because it’s taking me an extra semester to graduate. I’m so unhappy in college. Finding out today’s news means being broke for another year, and having to go through the mundane tasks and more irrelevant assignments that I won’t remember. My friend told me everyone starts to feel this away around their last semester/year of school, kind of like a ‘cabin fever’ to move on to the next phase of your life. I feel like there is no “next phase of my life”. I think this is such bad news because college is my biggest source of depression and stress. I’m exhausted, miserable, and  want to be done. 

I feel like I’m never going to be successful, happy, or financially secure. I spend my days trying to pull myself out of my negative thoughts and self-talk, it’s becoming increasingly hard for me to be present in the day or to get out of bed. I just don’t know what to do with myself anymore. I’m exhausted from pretending to be okay and be happy, I just don’t want to be here anymore."

i feel like if i’m ever happy it’ll just ultimately go away, or i’m just a fraud who doesn’t deserve to be happy... isn’t it a law of the universe that bad people get punished. why should i be any different.

Since I smoked weed I had a grand time but it always followed with me digging up my earliest memories and  finding out why I suffer from anxiety and depression. Normally this would be a good thing now I know what the problem is but the fact I feel like there isn’t anything I can do about it makes it 10x worse. 

My parents never allowed me to visit a counselor until I gave them plenty trouble and had the police called on me. My parents are shitty but I feel like shit cause I know they love me but they just don’t know how to care for me. I know it’s not to late that why I haven’t ended it, but it’s getting harder and harder.

Any advice? I felt like I haven’t felt emotion outside of drugs since I was 8 years old and I’m currently 16 and passed high school."

It’s honestly worse than being able to attempt. Because, I have the resources, I’m not afraid of death, I want to die- yet my exhaustion is so prominent that I’m simply to tired to end it all. I’m desperate to just leave yet sleep sounds so much better. I’m just so done with myself."
There is nothing wrong with my life,2,mljrql,2,"I have a great job, kind wife, sweet daughter and another kid on the way. We don’t struggle with money, we are even able to spoil ourselves within reason. With all that being said, I can’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. I hate the person staring back at me. I’ve had depression my whole life with highs and lows. But now... it just feels different. I think about my life and I’m absolutely ashamed of myself. Things I did when I was younger, things that no one else remembers and aren’t even a big deal now, make me shudder when I think about it. I stay up at night thinking about “that one time I was really rude to that person who was really sweet to me”, “why did I not play basketball?”, “why was I the class clown?”.. stuff like that. I don’t think I’m suicidal but I’ve thought a lot about how I would do it were I to do it. I don’t know what’s wrong with me and I think it’s about time to ask for help but I don’t know where to start, that’s why I’m here."
I just want to feel alive,2,mljrf0,0,"The past 2 years or so I have been managing my depression pretty well. I got help, have fantastic goals for the future, and mostly overcame my suicidal thoughts and tendencies. Yes I am proud of myself for that. I just want to talk about how hard it is sometimes. Ever since I've ""improved"" life itself has not gotten much better, I am more mentally resilient and I am slowly achieving some goals but other than that no drastic changes have been made. Constant adversity makes it hard to be resilient and has been slowly taking its toll on me. 

The biggest thing I am talking about is the Covid pandemic. It has made things feel fucking impossible for a person like me. At 21 nearing 22, I have never had a job, have no friends in person, never had a girlfriend. I have the drive to do all these things but I am insanely frustrated with it because of the circumstances. I see all my friends (who I don't know in person) getting into relationships and getting jobs. Hell one of my friends is getting married and got a job for 80k during the fucking pandemic. I can't help but just blame myself for all of that, other people are progressing during the pandemic and I can't seem to land a job at Burger King. I am having a hard time justifying this because I have done a lot of work in the past year. I transferred out of community college with As and Bs, I have learned a language at a basic level, I have gotten decently fit, I have mostly learned how to drive. But these things just feel.. so slow. I am not progressing very fast or receiving any kind of immediate benefit from these things. 

I am not suicidal (at the moment), I just feel defeated. I am angry and frustrated, I burst out into tears over small things in front of my family. I had to drop a class this semester and had to do 10 hours of homework during the weekend because I had to see and help my dying grandfather all last week. It doesn't help that I have been turning to porn and video games like old times because they are the only things that distract me from the feelings of pain and stress. Home life is not great, I am constantly being screamed at by my narcissistic sibling who makes fun of me for showing emotion, my mom will be gone for a few weeks/months, my dad I get along with but he doesn't really understand depression and is busy. So out of the two people I actually get to talk to, one is openly hostile and the other is distant. Online friends sometimes help but I am not too close with most and some don't seem to really understand. I keep telling myself it will be over soon and things will magically turn around for me when the pandemic ends but I am have been getting more pessimistic recently.

Don't mean to write a college essay, but this has been really bothering me for months now. I am mostly just venting because I am frustrated."

What's my issue ?,1,mlomfe,0,"I'm 22 years old and since I was 17 I began experiencing mood swings of varying intensity. 

These mood swings are triggered by very or extremely negative things. The worst ones begin with a blind rage for a few minutes where I feel like I can't control myself and then sadness for a few months until it goes away. The most extreme ones have only happened 3 times.

After these triggers I feel less human and moral, like I'm eroding and becoming a human shell.
I cheated on my ex who left me for another person without guilt and lying has become something I do automatically.

I don't know what to do."

In case something happens - there's a possibility I might end up responding or generally continuing the thread using a new account, the depression in my case dealt a lot of damage to my ability to remember things and I am very much expecting to forget the login info for this one.~~  


I come to you in a time where once again I seem to have hit emotional rock bottom, I don't think I'm expecting anything out of this, other than maybe venting in a text form and jutting everything - or what I can recall - down eases my mind a little, even if for like 5 minutes.  


I guess this is where I start, I have no idea how long this will get and I doubt I will have the patience to read through this to make sure it makes sense, or for any other reason, and my mind is something you could easily describe as broken, so if something ends up weird, inconsistent, or anything of the sort, I apologize greatly. I should also let you know, that while I think my English is not that awful, it is not my first language and on top of that, the ""plague that's ravaging my mind"" has actually made me a fair bit worse at it than I used to be. I hope the combination of mad ramblings and shitty English doesn't make it so that this is painful to read, or hard to understand. If it ends up that way, I apologize again and you have my blessing not to feel obligated to waste your energy trying to decipher it if it gives you a headache.  
There is a few things I can tell you for sure: all throughout my life I have tried and will continue trying to be the best person i can, to live by truth - conditions apply, for example while i do struggle with it, i sometimes allow myself a white lie if it helps with the other things in this sentence - to not make things harder for other people - on the contrary, try my best to make it easier for others, to not be a burden etc - to not be a hypocrite and to be humble. There's probably a few other things i should let you know about but i don't remember what else i wanted to mention so this will have to do. There is a reason why I said what i did, despite how full of shit it makes me sound, especially when I said i try to be humble, but trust me it wasn't easy to write down, mainly because of that. The reason I needed to mention some of those is that I want you to understand how i think - my moral compass, words i live by - and to add a layer of legitimacy to some of the claims that might follow. I want it to be clear that this isn't a joke, a troll post, a smearing campaign driven by an agenda, or an everyday hobby troll note from a compulsive liar. I hate lies - all my life i have been hurt, manipulated by them, I know firsthand the damage they can inflict and I understand them well. Since we are getting to know each other I might as well tell you the few things one could call me if they want it to hurt - something i understand you should never do on the internet. The words ""hypocrite"" and ""liar"" are the two words I am scared to be called in life. I probably forgot some, but these are the most important for what I'm trying to convey, which is: **please believe me**. If there are inconsistencies or signs of me lying in this post, if things don't add up - trust me it is not because I'm trying something funny, more likely just evidence of my head being doodoo.  


Well, I was supposed to start and look where we are, nice going me.  


I'm an 18 year old guy from the Czech Republic, born and raised a Catholic. From a personality test i had done at my school back in the day - a melancholic first, phlegmatic second (i believe the choleric was third and sanguine was last). I have been in an official battle against depression (and in my opinion PTSD, for reasons you might understand by the end of this) for two or three years now, and in a not-so-official battle with depression for like ten years, maybe twelve. As you can probably tell there is a bit of a dissonance between the official and non official versions - that means people only started believing me and stopped saying I'm a pussy bitch, i should get over it, or act like a man, when I ran out of fuel and physically stopped moving for days at a time two or three years ago, but the problem was going on for a long while before then. I myself didn't really let the thought it was depression get to me after hearing the aforementioned enough, because, from what I understand now, I was conditioned by my family and society into believing that I'm perfectly healthy - just a bitch. Granted, at this point I'm pretty sure i am a bitch as well, but that's besides the point.  


So, for the diagnosis period. When I slept through a few days and just didn't leave my bed at all, my parents, or to be more precise my mom, decided that hey, maybe that's not a very good sign and did some research, or ended up talking to a work colleague and I ended up being dragged to a psychologist next town over. We didn't really click and after losing a good fucking bunch of perfectly fine money I'm still salty about we moved on to a different psychologist who ended up being my current doctor and psychiatrist who I will call Sarah. Sarah diagnosed me with the expresso depresso - big surprise for everyone but me - motherly tears were shed and I was finally noticed, it felt like my parents really cared. I quickly found out Pepsi and Doritos made me feel a little better and my parents showed how much they cared by even going out of their way to provide them. Hell, even my cat seemed to understand what was going on because she slept with me a lot which helped too.  
It only gets worse after this, at least when it comes to parently (and feline) care - when it comes to my condition(s), this marks the beginning of a cog-shaped cycle of ups and downs - shortly after getting new meds I feel ok-ish, then I go on a decline, get new meds, start feeling better - steady decline. Rinse and repeat. Weirdly enough I miss this period of time. Nowadays my parents seem to, i don't know, they seem like they've forgotten about it all. I understand this is probably tiring for them, I am grateful for what they do and all - don't get me wrong, but I can repeat all that in my head, but it won't help with how things are, it wont help me cope with how they treat me now and it won't make it so I don't miss those days they really cared (or at least they showed it). Now it just feels like im a burden, like im just in the way. Sometimes they even complain to me, about me, when for example I come to one of them because I feel really down and i just need a hug. I have heard the equivalent of ""can you just stop being depressed"" three or four times now. Maybe I interpreted it wrong, but trust me i mauled it over a whole bunch of times and it holds up so far. By them I think i mean my mom, surprisingly - she always was the more loving/caring of the two, but I'm pretty sure I only heard it from her. Maybe its work getting to her. She has been stuck at the same job of a radiology technician at a local clinic for 30 years, I believe. Wouldn't be a problem if her dick boss didn't make all of the employees create one man companies so he can avoid taxes or something like that, and if they (all of them radiology technicians) didn't have to run the joint entirely by themselves, filling all of the positions, while obviously getting paid for one. I'm pretty sure there were 5 of them, then some left and recently the boss hired two young girls to do secretary work, but he hired them properly, with a contract. Best thing is my mom or her colleagues can't do shit about it, because by being forced to create those mini companies, they were forced to break the law and if they have, like my mother, used any company owner discounts for taxes or whatever else, which they most likely have, if they're getting paid as little as she is, then they're fraudsters by definition, whether by their own design or not. When it comes to my dad's work hes doing fine, he showed me a psych analysis paper he received once in an old job he quit a long time ago and i can see why he gets promotions very shortly after getting into a new job, hell i would give him a promotion if he showed that shit to me after coming to my job interview. The job im talking about paid very well and I sometimes wonder how many of our current troubles would've been avoided had he not quit, but it was very stressful apparently. This is all a quick summary to let you know why i feel a massive amount of pressure to do well in life. My dream is to have a stable life myself and to be able to provide my parents and loved ones with a life that is better than this, AFTER they retire. Its my dream and its my responsibility - meanwhile here I am, summarizing my life with tears in my eyes to a mob of strangers on the internet hoping i get a minute or two of peace and quiet from my own brain.  
So, Sarah - she runs a private clinic where she also referred me to a psychologist, who we will call Lisa. For about a year or maybe two, idk, I've been under Sarah and Lisa's care, with on and off results as stated before. Recently I started contemplating whether or not I should commit myself to a psych ward, but my mom quickly extinguished that idea, then Sarah did, by saying that should be the last resort. Sarah is actually the head of a daytime psych ward in a nearby town - or what i believed to be a nearby town only to find out it would take me hours and heaps of money to get there. The ""last resort"" status of a psych ward solution held up until a friend of my mom told her about her daughter's positive experience with one, so obviously a few days later I was sitting at an interview with a head of the reffered psych ward. It was supposed to be an interview to let me know if there's even any use for me at a hospital but i ended up locked up in a covid-test-result-awaitee room an hour later. That was the 5th of February and by the 29th if i remember both dates correctly, I was out and feeling surprisingly well. My objective there was to get out ASAP, not getting better, unfortunately, because I never handled being away from home well. I had no idea I could miss home and my family as much as I did. I was let out early on a condition - that I would attend the daytime psych ward, next building over. That is where I am at right now. I schedule visits with a psychologist and the head of the ward, once or twice a week and once a week respectively. I had a visit booked with both of them on Good Friday, which I called off because I was too tired to drag my ass there, and one today, which i called off because i was too tired to drag my ass there. Actually i spent the entirety of today in my bed on the verge of crying. Also, apparently even though i was told ""its ok to call off visits"", if i miss one more they'll have to let me go, because apparently ""they cant treat me if i don't show up"" - that's a great justification for literally telling someone not to come again, isn't it? I don't know if that's funny or painful. ""We can't help you if you don't come, so do us a favor and never show up again"". Anyways, I have the two visits tomorrow, and there's absolutely no pressure for me to come, clearly. The same way I felt the best I've felt for a long time shortly after leaving the psych ward, today i feel the worst i have felt since i can remember - for what that's worth. I'm pretty sure I feel as bad as I felt back in the day when i just said fuck it and stayed in bed for a week, but I wouldn't know, memory doodoo and all that.  


As for school, I go to a pretty sought after technical school (which is 4 years long - one year longer than regular high schools - or 5 years long for the kids two years younger than me, with 4 years being regular \[reformation\]) and my faculty is IT- it was hard but i had the backing of the best set of classmates I have had in my entire life, starting from kindergarten. It is honestly the only class i was assigned to, who didn't leave me with some sort of trauma - on the contrary - and again, including kindergarten. Notice how i said it *was* hard. I passed year one just fine, the running-out-of-fuel and catatonia problem took place around the second semester of year 2 but i passed alright, I had to write the classification test for one subject, other than that i managed to tie the ends together. I'm now in year 3 and it will stay that way. I have to stay the year because there is no physical way i could make up all the things i missed, so the only, singular good group of classmates and probably the best main teacher (?) i was ever assigned - I'm letting go of. How fun. Even better is the fact that - you've probably caught on by now - there is no guarantee I will be just magically healthy next year. I have arranged for individual teaching with the youth's education centre (or however you call that) my school works under, the papers are waiting for me to come back to school, but all of that was a year ago and I can only hope they didn't throw them out, because I never actually took them home.  


  
Well, it is now 1 am for me, the desperation wore off a little after a dinner and a shower and this post is already massive, while I have not even gotten into the ""good stuff"". I should probably scrap this, but I can't quite commit, as usual, so I gave it some thought and decided I'm not gonna post this on a complete throwaway, just make a new account, and split this story of mine into parts. I also realised that if I truly want to vent, I will end up giving away enough information about myself for someone from my past to recognize me, if for some reason they end up stumbling upon this newly established series. If you read this, think you recognize me and for some reason decide you want to laugh at me, expose my information, or share this post with some other mutuals to have a good laugh at my expense - act like a fucking grown-up and just ignore me.   


Take care and talk to you soon,  
\- Tom"
How do I support my partner with depression,2,mlj9up,0,"My partner and I have recently split up after several months of him struggling with depression and refusing to acknowledge or talk about it, while also neglecting me. I want nothing more than for him to get better so that we can get back together, but right now, he doesn't want to have anything to do with me. He doesn't want help. I'm scared he's in a dark place but I don't want to keep pushing. How do I support him in a way that he will be receptive right now? Should I give him some space and wait for him to reach out? Should I reach out to him and let him know I am here? I keep going back and forth on what to do, because I'm scared that anything I do or say will upset him at this point."
It's a special loneliness,2,mlj9d0,0,"I feel so lonely. 

I live with my boyfriend, and I am so fortunate to have him. 

He gives me all the attention possible. 

Yet I feel a special type of loneliness. 

A feeling that no one will ever truly understand what is going on within me. 

A reminder that I will always be stuck with myself, I will always only be me. 

I feel so lonely."
Something that gets me is the absolute degradation of trust I have in friends and people.,2,mlj71v,0,"No one had proven to be someone I can truly trust in. I see thru my family and all their faulty advice they give me. A friend of mine says I can look to him for advice, like an older brother, but I am too aware of his biases, his differing / opposing motives that make me realize he is not truly for me.

 I've got no role models, save for distant famous individuals who are just concealed enough for you to project idealistic beliefs onto. My role models have been shit since birth and now I'm paying for it. 

But it's just the nature of life to be neither black or white, but excessively grey. There seems to be nothing I can really trust. Is it supposed to feel this lonely? How am I expected to cope with existence? Is it every person for themselves, and if so, why am I supposed to care for this being that I never asked for? "
Depression Journal-Day #1,1,mlnzgn,0,"No need to read this post friend, only for those who are bored beyond measure :)  
I'm trying something new. This is my depression journal. I had some energy today and I felt like writing my progression. I'll write both positive and negative things that happen to me on that day. Maybe I get better maybe I won't. Also some of these things might be trivial to you  if you are reading it like just getting out of bed but it's not trivial to me  
Day 1:  
Got out of bed  
Brushed my teeth 2x  
Cleaned my room  
Didn't skip online class  
Paid attention to some parts of the lecture actually  
Studied a small amount.  
Exercised a very small amount.  
Ate proper healthy meals 3x  
Tried doing something new(drawing as long as I could as I normally don't do that)  
Felt bad not doing more, I don't know why I am not satisfied...fuck  


I'm still far behind in life but I tried and at the back of my mind I keep telling myself I should have done more, that it is not enough. Hopefully one day It will be enough. For now I will take baby steps."
Pretty Blue,2,mlixjh,0,"Today isn't the greatest day of all time, to be honest in the past 2-3 Weeks i've gone back to feeling pretty low/depressed. I can't find enjoyment in anything to be honest, anyone up for a talk?"
Is it weird that it feels like the emotion stopping me from looking up suicide methods and stopping me from researching antidepressants are the same?,1,mlnjyy,0,It kinda feels like they are.
First time taking zoloft,2,mlihb0,2,"So, my doctor prescribed me 50mg of zoloft for my anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I haven't started it until now because I was on the fence about it, but my therapist encouraged it so I eventually warmed up to the idea. I'm not sure when to start taking my doses, because on the label it says to not drive or do anything until I know how it affects me, but would it be okay to start them on a day I have to drive to work? Or should I start them on a day I have off?"
Why are there so many of us?,2,mli72u,6,"Really? What is happening in our world to cause so many of us to feel this way? It just doesn't make sense...I mean if it is chemical,  emotional,  whatever. I'm genuinely concerned by the amount of depressed and suicidal people in this country,  including myself. How the hell do we stop this train?"
depressed AF,4,mlcpdv,5,"alright, so i'm almost 18 and i'm in the modeling industry but the past two years i really disconnected from all my friends and work has been extremely low. I've been abused literally for my whole life with my sibling and my mother but my dad and me are extremely close to moving far away. I also have an eating disorder and have been struggling and they keep triggering my ED with the bullshit they say. I don't know how long I can handle this because i'm so close to freedom yet it feels so far away. Really i literally have nothing to do every single day except working out. I have a couple of online friends I talk to but I just don't know how much longer i can wait to get out of this retarded house."
He blocked me,1,mlmpkn,6,The guy I liked blocked me because I called him out for being on dating apps and using those apps while we were hanging out. Every time I express my feelings he blocks me and I have to make 5+ fake accounts just to bother him so he can respond but this time I know it’s done. He really broke my heart 💔😕 I think I was in love with him
Wits end,2,mlmktr,2,"In hospital have been for a week with serious physical health. 

Messaged partner saying I’m having a bad time, sobbing, really feeling not ok head wise.

Get told 

‘You can have 10 mins if I come down I’m not being out past 10’ 

Would you. Give someone you love and adore. A ten minute window when their world is falling apart? Who even knows what the world is anymore"
"TW: Depression, SH",2,mlhbe1,0," I was a high functioning mentally ill person for all my teenage years until this year. I'm 21 years old and I've never been this low in my entire life, I feel like blinking is a chore and I find myself to stop breathing frequently. I get plenty of sleep, but always tired. I overeat like an ogre, or starve. Last week I fell on the ground and could not get up because  I had absolutely no energy, not even to chew food. 

I have school 35h/week, and it's only memory shit. My memory is absolute shit. All my energy goes into studying and I can't stand straight anymore. I can't finish sentences, I can't recognize myself, I can't feel anything but agonizing anxiety and pain. 

I've been wanting to stap myself for a while, to feel something, but it would be messy. I would get drunk and SF, saying over and over again how much I want to die. 

I'm on a waiting list for a psychologist and have no plans to kms, but I also don't know bc there's a possibility I might snap, who knows. 

I want peace of mind, I'm tired."
I’m tired. Life is so hard.,1,mlm6sk,0,"I don’t have the energy to write, but i’m just tired of my life, i’ve been repeating for yeaaars that tomorrow will be better, but it never happened."
I have hyper-realistic morbid dreams every night and they completely detach me from reality.,2,mlm6b1,1,"I already have a bad enough problem with disassociation and detachment from reality, but the last four nights in a row have made it so much worse.

I don’t know how my brain even creates these horrible nightmares, with family members dying over and over again, and some with my friends telling me they hate me. I don’t feel like I know what is real anymore.

Waking up and getting out of bed is difficult enough, but waking up from these dreams makes life so much harder.

I don’t even want to live in real life, now my dreams are just another place I suffer."
Do you cry when stressed or anxious?,2,mlh7d9,2,If your not super sad/depressed in the moment just stressed & anxious do you find you can cry or do other things work better for you? I'm asking this cuz usually I cry a lot for depression feelings & its proven to help lower stress but I feel like it would be forced if I try to cry right now
I am to the point of just ending my life. I have no hope and no reason to keep going.,2,mllylc,4,"I have no hope left. I am 40 yrs old 500 lbs and on disability unable to work. I got a hell of a list of mental issues and I get 800 a month off disability. 400 of it going to bills. no extra income. no family, all are dead or I have nothing to do with the ones that are alive. I have not one friend, and not just saying oh I have no friends, but yet talk to about 3 people per week etc.

I literally have no one. it has been 4 years since I have voice chatted with anyone outside the room mates I live with. it has been over 12 years since I have actually watched movies etc with anyone. I am very high risk for covid, if I catch it, I will not survive it. I will literally die from it. my town doesn't have the vaccination and the nearest town is 30 miles away no way to get there.

all my town has is 20 plus fast food chains. a walmart and a brookshires. tons of dr's and a few churches. I am far from religious and been banned from all the churches for questioning the pastors/preachers and for calling them out on their bs for not doing what they preach but demanded others do what they preach. all my hobbies require money. and I need a vehicle to even do all of my hobbies. only hobbies that don't is gaming and watching movies and tv shows. since I torrent everything. but still, it absolutely sucks.

I owe the housing authority for low income housing 9 thousand dollars, and its not my fault but yet I owe them 9k. I have no car, bought one a few years ago and got scammed out of 3k. I have a crown that is broken and need to get fixed but can't afford the 1200 to fix it nor can I afford the 400 to have it pulled. it is also my only molar that I have left on my left side, if it gets pulled I won't be able to chew any hard foods. the nearest dental college is 30 miles away and again no way to get there and with this covid, I wouldn't trust going until I got my shots.

I been single my entire life, never had a real girlfriend. only about 6 women who pretended to want me and love me then faked their death on me or stalked me for over 5 years. never lasted more than a month with either of them. I have no children. always wanted kids in my early 20's never happened. now I am 40 and just don't want kids of my own anymore.

Spent the past 10 years trying to date and find someone to settle down with and the past 10 years, I have been laughed at, mocked at, made fun of, told to kill myself, told I don't deserve love. had a woman I met on reddit tell me I was a complete piece of shit because she read my post of how I survived 10 yrs being homeless and said anyone who steals is a piece of shit and needs to go to prison. didn't matter why they stole. yet she had 4 kids by 4 diff men no income and living with her parents and judged me for stealing food/socks to survive.

I have lived a hard life and because of it, I have cptsd and severe chronic depression along with paranoia and other issues. making it very hard at times to get over my past and I have cptsd nightmares sometimes of things I been through. meds help sometimes but not all the time. therapy does nothing. tried grounding and other things.

I just got out of 2k debt with 4 credit cards thanks to the stimulus check. I put that 1400 plus the other 600 I had saved towards all 4 credit cards. that 600, took me 4 months to save. I just have no hope left anymore. last time I been hugged, was back in 2012, before that, it was 2007, before that it was 1996. last time anyone told me they loved me and actually meant it, was back in 1996. last woman I been with or tried to be with was back in 2016. before that it was 2012, before that it was 2007. and a couple others between 2007 and 2016 but it was nothing but bs and me basically being catfished.

I just don't have it in me anymore to keep living life. I have no more reason to keep going.

I have done many many things in my life all cash under the table, some were actual paid jobs but didn't last but a few months or a couple weeks before I had to quit.

I have worked on Farms/Ranches and have done many things. I have done things from cleaning horse stalls, pig pens, shoveling manure and laying down fresh hay to washing and brushing horses. I have also done lots of land construction. Building pathways, concrete or cement slabs to build sheds on, all types of fencing even having to move fencing. digging trenches to lay down piping or wires. My day to day jobs varied on what the bosses wanted done on the Ranch/Farm.

I did boxing for six months but was forced to quit due to health issues.

I have taken jobs putting up walls, sheet rock, putting in floors of tile, carpet, laminate, even putting in outlets. I have done home repairs from plumbing, holes in the walls to rotten floors or counters. I have even built tons of different driveways built out of all types of things. Dirt, Rocks, Pavement, Cement, Concrete, Asphalt. I have even built several porches or decks for peoples houses and wheelchair ramps for their homes. I even got into painting ceilings and walls for peoples homes indoors and even installing light fixtures and ceiling fans.

I have owned a landscape company called Big. E. Landscape, which consisted of mowing, edging, trimming, planting trees, plants, bushes, trimming bushes and shrubs.

I went to California and got my Class A - CDL to drive eighteen wheelers and had a job for a bit doing that for almost 5 months but was forced to quit because of my anxiety attacks from driving them. My job was to operate the truck, hook and unhook the trailer, make sure the trailer was safe for transport and was loaded properly and strapped down properly and to plan out the route via a map and make sure I had the route down and all of the fuel stops and rest stops down along the route.

I worked in the rodeo scene preparing horses and bulls for the show and then putting them back in the pins after the show and giving the horses a bath and brushing them after the show.

I worked with this local heavy metal band. Which consisted of setting up their guitar, bass, drums and mic's during shows and tuning them. Then I had to break everything down after the show and put it up.

I got into Archery and even got into fletching arrows and selling the arrows I made. which turned into a small local business of my own.

I owned a small auto business doing tune ups mostly consisting of changing their oil, radiator fluid, spark plugs, belts, alternators, radiators, fans, batteries, tires. bulbs. fuses.

I used to fix computers and do computer repair from home and fixing cars doing tune ups like oil changes flat tire fixes belt changes light bulb changes spark plug changes brake changes alternator changes radiator exchange changing batteries simple minor things like that and ran the business myself and getting customers via online websites or word of mouth.

and here I am, 40 yrs old, no friends, no family. mental issues out the ass, in a small dead end town. no way to get anywhere. no where to go. trapped. every time I tried to leave this town things came up, either needed eye surgery, or had to use what money I saved. I can't do it anymore. regardless how much I try it always blows up in my face or I end up failing and making things worse for myself. I am at this point, just waiting to die."
I broke down because of a phone call.,7,ml84hr,4,"
I don't post much about my issues, since I don't see much of a reason to do so but I guess, i need to vent. 

For background, I have a few friends, most of them long distance, I also have a few people who are interested in me romantically and/or sexually too. I don't pay much attention to them but, I recently met a specific person who is really wanting a connection with me.

My depression has been super severe lately so I don't typically respond because I don't have the mental energy to do so. This person wanted to call me but I haven't exactly called anyone in the spur of the moment in years now. I tried my best to push myself to accept but I eventually broke down and started crying.

I vented to them that I felt worthless, that I suffered so much trauma in my life and that I was so sorry for bothering them.

I decided to distance myself from the situation just so I could get myself together. They eventually went to sleep and I just feel so alone and useless right now. I'm not sure what to do anymore.

Everything sucks."
I wish I killed myself earlier,170,mkpo20,20,"this is very much related to school and grades, just a heads up

before you think I'm being selfish, it's the opposite really. all I ever do is cause pain and trouble. literally just wasting my parent's money which they made clear several times.
I attempted suicide in 7th grade, my biggest regret is that it didn't work, I regret not killing myself before going to therapy and fixing my relationship with my family, it would've been so much easier for everyone by now. my friends would've been over me already and moving on with their lives, my parents have my older sister to keep them happy and care for them when they get older, she's well on her way to get a stable job so I don't have to worry about her
I know it would be tough on my friends, especially my best friend, but she'll understand. she'll forgive me because she knows I'm too weak to survive any longer. she won't blame me, at least nor for a long time.

things are terrible now, I'm a senior in high school and I failed my primarily exams, in a few months I take the main ""big"" exams which determine if I go to a good college or not

I've been feeling like a failure for a long time now and no one takes the effort to make me think otherwise, my failing grades are always a great proof too. 

I used to blame my depression, but I really don't have the right to do that, I've always been lazy and bad at school, mental illness only made them worse.. it didn't make me a failure, it just proved it further.

I live in a big house, I'm healthy and my parents are financially just ok.i have the luxury of going to therapy once every few months and taking antidepressants. I know people who have a 100x worse living situation than me yet they do amazing in school, my cousin have abusive parents, live in a shitty small house in a bad area, is most likely depressed and can never go to a therapist, yet she's excelling academically. and that's just one example.

I know I probably sound overdramatic, selfish, lazy.

I know I am.
I'm also weak, too weak to live anymore. 

for the first time in a long time, I got the urge to starve myself and inflict self harm on myself, but I'm trying my best not to follow them.

I feel like it's too late to kill myself now, it will hurt my friends and I love them too much to do that.. but I feel like I deserve to do something for myself, just for once.

I probably won't do it soon because I'm scared of failing,if my parents found out it would be a big scandal and a shame to them..

I'm not sure if anyone would bother to read and respond to this, i sure wouldn't. but I needed to write this out.."
Am I depressed?,2,mllukx,2,Very cheerful person almost all the time. Then suddenly out of no where feel like it’s the end of the world and can’t seem to put a smile on my face. Any thoughts
Finally took the plunge and spoke to the doctor properly,3,mldtxw,0,"I have battled depression on and off for 2 years now, however I have always been able to control it until the last 6 months or so, it caused the breakdown of my marriage, and just over a month ago I tried to end my life, but thankfully called emergency services after a feeling of regret, fast forward a month and I spoke to the doctor today, she came up with a treatment plan which will include councilling and also 50mg of Sertaline daily.

&#x200B;

I really hope this is the start of finally getting myself back, after having this mental illness ruin so many peoples lives in my life, I finally want to feel better, it's going to be a long road from here and I know there's going to be many more downs on the way, but I just hope this is the start of my way out.

&#x200B;

No real point to this post, just wanted to write down this massive step I have taken today, it's haunted me for weeks since I tried to end my life, and I kept putting it off, but finally plucked up the courage this morning.

&#x200B;

Hope anyone else in my situation seeks help."
Why am I still alive?,3,mldshj,3,I feel like my presence is bugging everyone. They may not say it to be nice but I could feel it nonetheless. I have plans to commit suicide at a certain age anyway so I know I won’t be missed.
Sad,1,mlll94,0,I feel like my life is at its end and idk why. I feel exhausted and sad because it feels like I’m almost at the finish line. I’m not suicidal and honestly im scared that I will randomly die. I just don’t feel like I’m gonna be here for a long time for some reason.
Come to such a depressing realization.,2,mlglnz,1,"I am fully aware now that the problem is not me. I always thought there was something wrong with me and couldn't understand why people were so harsh and disinterested in others, always relating everything back to them and maintained this superficial crap, now I realize that is how humanity and society operates. I could never play the game of running around being super productive and being this super interesting person, that society and humanity seems to expect of people. 

I realize nobody gives a f*ck, everyone is so focused on their own car payments, insurance, job, family, health, on and on that nobody could give a rats ass about you, sure their are the exceptional few who will help you if your down and many will do the whole I'm sorry and maybe even feel it, but we live in our own isolated bubbles and our goal 99.9% of the time is to maintain that bubble. For example someone, who has a stable life going for themselves isn't going to want to interrupt that and bring someone who isn't doing financially well or who isn't mentally stable into that.

 But that is the problem to me is people constantly wanting to maintain their crap. For example, I tried to be friendly and make friends with this class I was in, I was very open and I wasn't pushy but a down to earth kind person, I am anyway but I did it extra, someone you couldn't help but want to be friends with, sure call me manipulative but it was a test to see how open people are to someone who is no threat at all. Well nobody wanted to be my friend. They all were polite and respectful and treated me well but not one person wanted to connect as friends and that said it all to me really, people are so obsessed with their stuff that they would lose out on being friends with a very kind person.

 Now you could say that is also the way classes operate, you go there act all nice for the months your there and then pretty much forget about each other, to me that shows how shallow people are, they only connect and show goodness when it's convenient for them. Its all about what a person wants, this is our selfish human race, everyone is out for themselves and when someone has the opportunity to make friends with a caring kind person they don't even care to take it. I'm no longer feeling the sting and pain of rejection of feeling so misunderstood, I'm not feeling sorry for how sad and pathetic it is. They wanted their cert for the course and then to bounce, and while their doing it they will entertain you but after they get it, its lets move on to the next thing and then be all fake nice again, it's such b*llshit."
Thearapy,1,mlljnv,1,I dont want to sound like a douche but i really dont understand thearapy. Ive tried it but its just a random person that could never understand how someone else feels. I understand ut has worked for many and im happy for them but I dont understand it. Anyone here with positive experience?
What is the fucking point....,1,mllgyl,3,"Christmas in 2020 was shit. me and my brother went to my dads after he phone us telling us that he had something to tell us. We went up thinking that his cancer might be back again which he got in 2018. But after we got in the house and sat down it was really clear that wasn’t it. He told us that he was arrested for indecent photos of children.... at first I wanted to beat the shit out of him. I was built up with soo much rage and anger but I am not normally a angry person. He then told us that tried to kill him self three times in the space of two weeks and telling us that he was sorry and shit. Me and my dad haven’t ever really had the best relationship and he didn’t have any clue about me ever. That night I went home told my mum what happened then went to bed and all these scenarios went through my head. What happens when his name gets put out on newspaper or something and I have to change my first name and second name. Which leads to me then having to tell my friends and other people who might know ask me why i change it and stuff. And then they might think that I might be like him or something. Once I did discussion thing in school and it was about Paedophiles and crime n shit why I think they should get the death penalty for doing the crime. Then I thought would I want my own dad to get it and now I am in this situation...... few other things played through my head that night. Didn’t get any sleep as well. Ever since then I felt like shit and everybody that I know or has ever seen me has been talking about me behind my back and saying shit about me or my family. My friends in last couple of months have been distance away from me and every now and then I see photos of them out and shit and never get invited or anything and now I am thinking some of that stuff I was thinking on that very same night just might be true. And now stuck in this situation we’re my friends might not like me evermore and everyone in town knows what my dad is and what they think about me.... it’s crazy to think that something that was completely out my hands or any sort of control has ruined my life and now stuck in this depression day in and day out and been hiding it. Been trying to find myself a apprenticeship for like nearly month now and starting to think I might turn into him. And now I don’t know what to do and starting to go deeper and deeper into a hole everyday. Anyways I hope  everyone has better life than me. love you all👍

Sorry If I wasn’t aloud to swear and stuff it’s kinda bad habit and also sorry for my spelling and stuff."
Doing work while dealing with depression,1,mlldi8,0,"So I’m not really sure what to say but I have a question and I’ll give some background that might help. 

How do you deal with depression and getting school work done? 

I’m in college living away from home, and I’ve had an unconventional route through college due to health complications. I am currently seeing a therapist and taking medication but I wanted advice from other people who deal with depression. 

Depression is something I’ve struggled with for a while and usually I go through periods where it’s difficult for me to get work done, but it usually passes and I’m able to catch back up. 

But this past semester my depression has been pretty bad. As I’ve said I’m working through issues that contribute to this and am actively trying to get better. But my school work has been severely impacted and I am behind. I am still getting some of my work done but often I find it really difficult to do anything productive and instead do things that distract my mind - tv and video games. 

I was just wondering if anyone had advice on how to get myself to do work or motivate myself during this period?"
"My life sucks, and lockdown made it worse",1,mlldeu,0,"I have developed major insecurities and depressive, suicidal thoughts over the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. I had a lot of time in my hands, and most of it were spent thinking about my situation where I had slapped myself with harsh realizations. I have regarded myself as poor and somewhat handicapped due to my situation. To get in straight to the point, I feel insecure and jealous of the people around me living in subdivisions. Literally every single one of the  people I know lives in one, while I live in the middle of the city. They live their lives with fresh air in the mornings and cold breeze at the night, while 24/7 I go out and all my nose gets is polluted air and dust. They live with peaceful bird chirping sounds while there's not 10 seconds of silence in here due to the endless traffic noises and annoying honkings. 

I love playing sports (basketball and badminton) and I have become a varsity player at school beginning at my sophomore year. I realized that I only get to practice when I get my ass off to an arena which will take a couple of minutes (and travel, entrance fees, gets expensive overtime) to get into, while my friends just casually go out their houses and play in basketball and badminton courts in their village. The insecurity in me is that I could've become this, could've become that.. if only I had the means to do it. Yes, no excuses quotes exists, but damn it's painful to see everyone excel at a very rapid rate than me. I also like to record songs but traffic noises piss me everytime and throws my mood away.. while my friends just flex on me their peaceful sounding subdivisions and record their music with minimal takes.

What made everything worse is that, the lockdown literally gated me from doing EVERYTHING... while them... they CAN STILL do the usuals. Damn, it pains me when I see their stories about playing basketball, taking walks in their village, practicing driving, morning jogs, leisure activities, cycling, while all I feel is that I'm rotting inside my house. All I have is my computer, and all I do all day is play a bunch of games. I resorted into gaming getting my dopamine to somewhat ease the pain, but everytime before I sleep everything just hits me again. It sucks that I try to be happy everytime my friends and my girlfriend say something about their activities in their subdivision, deep inside I feel so jealous and insecure... 

I do not envy anyone though. In fact, it is good that they have such privileges. It is one's fault that this is my situation. It is just undeniable that I feel like trash and depressed every single day. I wish I could take fresh air in.. wish I can walk at mornings, afternoons, evenings.. wish I can go out of my house without wearing masks. I feel like I am wasting my teenage years where I have the most potential.. inside my house in total isolation with nothing to do but online classes and gaming. It just sucks that my relationships are being affected too (I have been a lot irritable and my family thinks I hate them. I have also lost so much emotional and mental strength, affecting my relationship with my girlfriend), since I am losing motivation to be better at anything... I stopped my workout, my regular practice of coding... chores and hygiene.. I feel like everything is so unfair for me and there's no more reason to continue.

I wish I lived in a subdivision. If only my family was rich enough (my sibling also feels the same way as me, although we haven't talked about it, but I hear her having emotional breakdowns about this certain matter), but that's another conversation, and a whole another insecurity as well."
Do you personify your depression? Have you given it a name?,1,mll9i8,1,"In Dexter, he calls his murderous impulse his dark passenger.  I hope none of y'all have a real ""dark passenger,"" but have you named your depression?   Am I the only one who speaks to it? 

 I generally just say, ""Fuck you, brain!"" ;-)"
I have completely lost any will to function and survive,3,mlbbg3,1,I dont even know how to tell you people what I am feeling...
Advice,2,mlg87q,1,"My friend yesterday told me they attempted suicide. I wasn’t aware they were that bad in terms of mental health, they drink more often and take more of their medication than they should. They said not to tell our mutual friend of their attempt. Should I tell them? I’ve been in a similar place before and don’t want many people to know so they don’t overbear me.

What should I do?"
I need some motivation,6,ml8z24,3,"I need to unclog my shower drain, water the plants my parents gave me, and buy paracetamol. I want to go back to bed."
I think I’ve finally been broken,1,mll5rt,0,"After struggling with sad and really dark thoughts for almost 2years I’ve finally gotten to my breaking point. Usually I’d cry, be sad, think about bad stuff but for the past two days I’ve been just numb. I don’t feel anything anymore. I don’t feel hate, sadness or joy. I just exist. After getting in a big emotional fight I’ve lost. That’s it. I don’t feel anything..congrats life, you’ve broken me to the point i just see black and nothing else."
I've become so numb,2,mlg4zx,3,"Since the pandemic started, I've lost my motivation for living. I'm alived but I don't live. No one knows it because I look like an active person. I cook, I do gardening and work as a freelancer but I don't see anything in future. I've lost my interest in friends so many of my friends have left me but I'm completely numb😓 I don't like to be in relationship anymore and It seems that my libidio has gone. I miss my hardworking side and sometimes wanna kill myself when I see others trying hard."
Why,2,mlg2vr,0,Every time I think things are getting better they just revert back and get worse. Started some anti depressants that started making me feel better but it’s just one problem after another. I have extremely controlling Indian parents who don’t want me to move out and if I do they don’t want me to live with someone I met (I’m 22 and will be paying for the house myself). My mental health while I’m here suffers a lot because of them too (constant arguments with everyone and guilt trips). The anti depressants started bringing me up but every time I have to deal with them my mood goes down and I just feel like I can’t bear it at all and there’s no way out
I feel like a husk of my former self,3,mld2z3,3,"What happened to me?, I used to be so much happier. I was an optimist, I was popular, people talked to me, I had friends, my grades were some of the best in the class, I used to have energy to run around for hours, my dental health was great, hearing was great, I was fiscally fit, I was creative and was motivated to write down my ideas, I used to be confident, I was so energized.

But now I'm just, tired all the time, I've had a creative block for months now, I'm a pessimist, I'm physically unfit, I constantly hear a ringing, my eyesight is getting blurry, I have cavities all over my teeth, I have no friends, nor anyone that I can talk too, my grades have dropped to mediocre.

I'm always so bitter, angry, resentful, too everyone because they have friends and good relationships.

I'm a hermit that barely talks or exits his room, my family refuses to accept that I'm the issue, constantly attempting to change my environment or take away privilege's.

I'm so alone in life, no friends, no significant other.

I have a father, a mother, and a  younger sister. I hate spending time with them as it is always an unpleasant experience. My mother holds my to an unbelievably high standard; anything other than a 94% is failure, my father constantly insults me, makes fun of me and refuses to even try to change and  my sister loves to get under my skin, on multiple occasions I've broken down because of her, she always has to be in the right and even when she does something wrong my parents lump me into it. I complain about it and I'm called selfish, and ignored.

My face in the mirror is so dead, and tired, to the point where sometimes I cant remember what it use don't look like.

Every relationship in my life has been ruined by me. My first ever friend?, cant remember their name, elementary friends?, dumped them to hang out with the popular kids, the popular kids?, when they went away from the school I just stopped communicating, My old elementary friends?, also recently went away to another school and I cant bring myself to talk to them.

In a span of a 3 year I've lost my friends twice, had 2 of my dogs die, tried to kill myself 3 times, I've destroyed my family relationship, ruined my school life, and I am slowly rotting away.

I just feel so alone, and nothing in my life bring me pleasure anymore, its just the same repeating boring cycle everyday.

I  wish I could just go back, to times before.

I'm sorry to anyone reading this, I just wanted to vent a little and I'm not the best at writing comprehensibly ."

Help.,2,mlfwys,1,A part of me does not want help for my mental illness because I feel it is a part of me and one of my only personality traits.

"Unbereable anxiety and depression, addicted to benzos, suicidal and see no way out",2,mlftx6,2,"Hello everyone,

I apologize in advance for the long post but this is something I really need to get off my chest and I believe people here will understand my predicament. They may also hate me as I believe I genuinely suck as a human being.

&#x200B;

I am a 24 year old male living in Slovakia (central/eastern europe), I am currently not employed nor am I in education, I have failed university three times now, going to try again next year. About a month and a half ago my GF of 4 years broke up with me suddenly and I later discovered she was cheating on me for about a month prior, so that was another nail in the coffin (I was drinking heavily in the months prior to the breakup so I don't think it's fair to put all the blame on her). Also, I am severely addicted to benzodiazepines, I have convinced my father (god bless his heart he's the best and kindest father I could have wished for, despite him suffering a stroke and being 61 years old he still goes to work to support my unemployed ass and plans to keep working through retirement, though I want to cry every time I see how much he's struggling just to help me) to get perscription medication for ""himself"" but he gives it to me as he doesn't need it, he's a much stronger and kinder person than I could ever be. I also have a psychiatrist but I don't really tell him the truth, I just want to get the monthly perscription so I don't go into withdrawals. Currently I am using Tianeptine, Xanax, Stilnox (I believe it's called Ambien in the US, the active compound is zolpidem). 

Despite all the drugs I'm taking everything is just getting worse, I am incapable of functioning day to day, can't sleep at night I only sleep during the day which makes me feel even worse, I usually sleep from 10 AM to 4 PM and wake up with my stomach clenched from anxiety, vomit, spend an hour thinking about what a shitty decision it was to start using benzos in the first place and how my life was so happy before I had anxiety (started at about 17 years of age).

I started at a low dosage and after a year or so I got cut off because my then-psychiatrist thought I had been taking too much (she was right) though I managed to get clean after suffering the withdrawals, which weren't that bad at the time. I got clean. Then I started working at a call center for AT&T (I guess they outsource customer service to low income countries to cut the costs) and the stress made my anxiety come rushing straight back. The pay was pretty good (for eastern europe anyway) so I started to buy benzos off the street to cope with the stress, got fired anyway after about 4 months but I never stopped taking them after that.

I now feel my life is at a dead end and I can see no ""light at the end of the tunnel"". I consider suicide daily and feel like there is no future for me. I have been stuck in place for years now, I have not moved forward at all. Lost most of my friends, and the corona and the lockdown just made everything much worse.

Reading this, I can't help but think what a shitty and weak person I am, I am hurting my father (my mother cut me off from her life years ago in her eyes I'm just a junkie, she's also probably right), the only person that has stood beside me this whole time, while I should be the one supporting him by now. I have nothing but regrets, self-hatred and no self esteem to speak of.

I have done nothing with my life. I feel time passing me by, it seems like every year it goes faster and I'm scared of the future. I still care, I don't want to die, I just want the suffering to end.

I realize this was basically just a big stupid rant but I would be very grateful for any words of advice, support, encouragement. Anything. I am desperate, please help me, help me help myself.

TL;DR - The title of this post"
Functioning depression,1,mlksyc,1,"I’ve been doing a little reading about functioning depression.   The idea you can have depression but to the outside world it appears that your fine.   The experts seem to disagree that this is a real thing however I think it is part of a solution for me.   I’ve realized lately that if I keep it inside practicing mindfulness of my behavior and just not really express what I’m feeling or tell the truth when people ask me questions, the world around me is happier and they leave me alone.   The trick seems to be never to break ranks.   I made a slip up last night when I was telling my wife why I didn’t want to go out with some friends that invited us.  I should have just made up something like early meeting or tired or whatever.    If I can keep from doing that, life should be better for those around me.   It’s hell for me but what does that really matter."
I don't know what to do.,1,mlksre,0,I'm lost. I can't even get out of the house. It's just so hard to get up. I'm a mess. A fucking disaster. I just disappoint everyone. It's just so hard to keep go forward.
"Thought I was an introvert, actually a depressed extrovert (help)",2,mlfrhx,0,"I've had depression and anxiety for 10+ years. Over the past year or so I've worked on taking control of the anxiety and I've recently pulled myself out of the depression. It's a lot to go into and it's all behind me now. I feel like myself again, but it's been too long since I've been myself and I'm struggling to find my place. I need people, but I have two friends. One of them is completely unavailable because she's dealing with her own crisis and the other isn't the going out type at all. I feel like I have no connection to the world and I don't know where to start. I'm ADHD so I'm always bored as it is and the pandemic isn't helping. I've had that ADHD brick-on-the-gas-pedal feeling for months but I'm not moving and I feel like I'm going to burn out. I just need one friend who knows their way around a bit so I can get my bearings and start meeting people on my own. Where do I start?"
Lexapro?,2,mlfqx2,6,"Lexapro isn’t working. Have you found something else that helps?

Thank you"
Why do people always tell me do this or do that,1,mlkrho,0,"Basically after being depressed for years I told my parents and its made everything worse they treat it like it's one thing bothering me that I can just fix and also found out I was born with extreme anxiety, neurotic and pessimistic behavior, and I'm a perfectionist so literally nothing makes me happy and now I'm failing in school and all can think about is suicide fucking yay."
Does an antidepressant without diarrhea or tinnitus exist as side effects exists?,1,mlkqkx,1,"I stopped taking zoloft a few months ago (after being on it for five years), and it made my life worse than ever before, but I couldn’t stand the diarrhea. I am now in contact with a doctor again, hoping to get some therapy, but I know I need some kind of medication and I would like to have something on my feet before I go to the doctor and he just tries to throw random medication on me.

I have heard good things about buprorion but I am scared of the tinnitus side effect. I already have mild tinnitus and I don’t think I can stand it getting worse. After being on zoloft and having stomach issues, resulting in an almost fear of going to the toilet, I can’t stand that either.

I know it can be different from person to person, but generally speaking, what could be a medication that meets these criterias?"
It's 5:48AM but at-least I don't live in the Northern Territory.,1,mlkq9v,1,I feel like my anxiety and depression reinforce each-other. I feel overwhelmed. I NEED DRUGS.
I need help,1,mlkq3k,1,I currently left my job.. on terms I don't agree with and I've been piss off drunk for 4 days
Getting over ex,1,mlkoo5,6,"Hey guys.  I'm feeling discouraged.  I want to be closer to my ex, but she doesn't reply when I try.  How do you keep faith in a better future, if you have serious doubt?  I actually feel hopeless sometimes."
"Warning, long read.",1,mlkn6s,1,"It doesn't matter what the fuck I do, I will never find long-term satisfaction with my life or myself. Everything I do to change things is just a temporary band-aid that helps me feel better for a little while and then I just go back to my default mood of hopelessly depressed. I've been so dissatisfied with my life and myself for so long now that I think I've forgotten what it feels like to be somewhat ok with things. 

Being unemployed in a town that I never really adjusted to moving to was a major source of my depression for quite a while, so I thought finally finding a job and moving back to my hometown would finally help me to feel better.  And it did, for a couple weeks. But now i'm really struggling to hold back negative thoughts again. That's pretty much the story of everything I've tried to help me. 

And I feel like I really have tried everything. Tried drinking water, getting more sleep. Tried setting up a routine, helped for a little bit, not long though. Tried getting regular exercise. I just feel like shit again as soon as the endorphins wear off. Tried changing my attitude and outlook on things. 

I feel lonely on a level so profound that I cannot fully describe it with words. Surrounded by people, yet unable to connect with, relate to, or have any sort of meaningful shared experience with anyone. I feel totally disconnected from people. No matter how hard I try to make friends, I feel uncared for, like I'm a burden, like my friends would ditch me at the first chance, etc. And i don't know at this point how much is reality and how much is just the voices in my head. 

Dear God, the fucking voices. Not literal voices that I actually hear, but it's the best way I can describe these uncontrollable intrusive thoughts I have. It's like I have this second person within myself, or somebody always whispering in my ear. Things like ""you're worthless"" ""this is all your own damn fault"" ""they probably talk about you behind your back"" ""just shut the fuck up, nobody cares"" ""you're being an overly sensitive sack of shit"". 

I was dealt a bad hand in life, and I made everything worse with my own poor decisions. Born into an impoverished broken home, parents got divorced when I was very young. Had a very unstable family life with an emotionally and verbally abusive step-dad for a few years. Even when things calmed down I had to deal with living in two different places with two different friend groups, two different everything. Which I feel impeded my ability to cement myself into a friend group I could feel like I really belonged in. 

I fell into a depression when I started high school due to a variety of complex factors that would require their own post, and instead of pushing through I allowed myself to neglect school and I got mostly Fs the first two years of high school. Sophomore year if I recall correctly I got straight Fs the whole year except for a couple Cs. Turned it around junior year, but at that point it was too late. You don't really recover from that. So then I had the option of either taking a full 5th year of high school to graduate normally or taking an exam to graduate early. (Not the GED, a state thing) Early in my senior year I opted for the latter and earned the equivalent of a high school diploma, but with a 1.43 High school GPA. I should have just swallowed my pride and taken the 5th year to improve my GPA, because now if I want to go to college I have to go to community college first and then transfer. I don't know if I'll ever forgive myself for my mistakes in High school. 

I'm now a year and a half out of highschool with a big resume gap due to being unemployed for a while due to the pandemic and a part-time job that I don't hate but I also am not thrilled about. I don't know how I'm going to get into the career I want (IT) with such bad Highschool grades and just a professional certificate or something. I definitely might go to college but i'm afraid I'd fail that too. I couldn't even succeed in High school, why should I think I can succeed in college? 

I just feel worthless and stuck. And the hardest part is I know a lot of it is my fault. Mental illness is a contributing factor but I didn't have to allow it to completely stop me from doing what I needed to do. I pushed all my friends away last year because I felt like none of them gave a shit about me. I'm so angry and ashamed with myself. I feel like I deserve this. 

This is getting long, so i'll just shut up now. I already feel like I'm over sharing. I need to get it off my chest though. My feelings are too difficult to describe with words, I feel like this post doesn't do it justice. I tried though. Thanks to anyone who listens..."
i just dont know anymore,2,mlfl98,3,"i was the happiest I've ever been during my freshman year and the first half of my sophomore year but now im just miserable. every night i go to bed hoping i dont wake up and i have thought several times about how i want to die, i have nobody to talk to about this and thats part of what caused this. i just dont know how i can continue like this, i have been unable to be happy for the last month or so and i just feel either numb or miserable or pissed off at the world. i dont have anybody to talk to and i feel like nobody would care if i did. i just want to stop feeling this way and i dont know if I'll make it through the year."
Seeing people who have friends and are happy pisses me off,29,ml0zhs,4,"I know I should be happy for people who are happy, and who have friends. But it just reminds me that I don’t. I see my cousin post on Instagram pictures of her friends, she seems like she’s happy, and it makes me feel even lonelier. Why can’t I have friends, why can’t I just be happy? It makes me so sad seeing it. My life is a fucking joke"
Sometimes I Just Want to Scream.,9,ml6t5b,0,"I've been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, and add for about 6-8 years now and nothing seems to ever get better. Within about 20 years of being alive I've experienced what feels like so much pressure and stress and it feels like it's never going to stop.

My family has completely blocked out my section of the family due to my dad being an illegal immigrant. He works so hard every day and it feels like everything just goes awful for everything in our lives. His brother was the one to turn him in to ICE and report him along with the entire restaurant he worked in. My mother is constantly sick with frequent returning ulcers and almost died about two years ago; we had to go for emergency surgery and fly to Mexico because American doctors refused to schedule an appointment for her since she had no insurance and we aren't extremely wealthy.

Growing up I had to take care of her while she was sick and even before then when she was constantly getting high off of prescription pills (muscle relaxers) and my older brother left me alone to deal with her and would constantly take out his anger on me while genuinely admitting that he hated me.

Then we lost my grandmother. She was the only person I trusted and could talk to about anything- the only friend I really had anywhere and the only safe place I really had. That was also about 2 or 3 years ago. She gave up living after my grandfather was practically murdered by the nursing home he was in since he had dementia (he, while being on 24 hour watch due to his lack of capacity to care for himself somehow managed to break his hip, get back on his bed and lie in his own waste for 12 hours without anybody noticing. totally normal, right?).

I'm supposed to just be okay after nothing but shit happening for my entire life, and I'm in college now. Everyday I feel terrified that this will be the last time I get to experience things in the States. If my dad is deported, my mother and brothers will follow and I can't handle being alone in this country when there's nothing here for me anymore. Everyday I feel reminded of every heavy thing in my life and I feel like I'm suffocating some days.

Most days I feel so empty and like I'm not even the one in control of my body, and some days I feel so frustrated that I just want to cry and scream. Hearing some people on campus just complain about mundane things makes me feel so irrationally irritated some days and I just want to scream and cry out my frustration, but I don't know how to let myself be angry and irritated so it just piles up until it's late at night and I relive all of it.

Last semester I was sexually assaulted by a shitty guy that I ignored every red flag while trying to date. This semester one of my friends threatened to kill themselves and I was so scared I called the police because I can't drive and they live 2 hours away.

I feel so alone. I feel so helpless to all my problems. It feels like everything is stacked against me and I don't know what to do anymore I just want to give up on everything.

My memory has been getting so bad from stress lately from all of my past feelings bubbling up and I can't tell who I am some days. I can't tell what I like or enjoy or what makes me happy. Everything tastes terrible, everything looks awful to me. I feel like everything I've done has been a mistake since nothing has gotten better. Sometimes I feel like I'm being dramatic when I try to vent to someone or think about it, and always back out of opening up to anybody on campus or in my personal lives, but when I'm awake late at night it just feels so awful to remember all of the awful things I've had to see and go through.

I feel pretentious or whatever the right word it is for even admitting some of these feelings. Maybe I'm just a shitty person and all of these things are bad karma or something I can't tell anymore. It just feels like every time I take steps forward I get hit 3 steps back and it makes me sick to think about a lot of these things.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if anybody reads this I just need to get it somewhere and out of my head to get some sense of relief or reality it just feels so overwhelming sometimes. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so tired of feeling all of these overwhelming feelings it's to the point it makes me physically ill, and it hurts because none of my ""friends"" on campus can understand any of this and there's nothing anybody can do to help."
I've been making the mistake of assuming that feeling okay is normal and misery is the deviation from normal that I have to work to get out of. Wrong. Misery is normal. Feeling okay is the deviation.,2,mlfj2p,1,"Stupid of me to hope that anything would be okay or work out for me or be easy.

I can't even get medicated because my healthcare system doesn't give a damn about mental health issues.

Stupid of me to assume a health care system would help me with my health.

There is no help out there. In fact, most things are a direct ""fuck you"". Time to stop expecting different. I'll be disappointed less often."
I need some advice,2,mlfhxx,4,So I have a friend that seems depressed his family don't care about him and he says that it feels like hes just a tool for them he dose not feel human i want to help him i want to try to get him out of there or a at least get cps involved but I need some advice on helping him idk what to do
I had a good day yesterday and I still feel good today,2,mlfhes,0,"Yesterday I had a good day. I got an appointment to get my vaccine (Johnson&Johnson), so I'll be full vaccinated by the end of the month. I got a lot of work done, and worked on a project that I've been procrastinating on for quite a while. Then in the evening I cooked dinner for the first time in months. Normally it's freezer pizza or sandwiches or eggs and a few beers, last night I made pasta with pesto, sausage, and a huge pile of vegetables. Didn't drink, didn't even want to. I feel great. 


Thanks for being rad, even when things suck."
Feeling so tired...,1,mlkhmi,1,"I don't know how to make this short without making dry, but let me try. Since I know myself, I have been working towards something, always prioritised school, work, being ""proper"", being a ""people pleaser"". But now, I am burnt out - flat out burnt out. I don't want to lift my arm, get out of bed, or live anymore. What's the point? I used to be able to motivate myself somehow to work on myself with the aim of a more ""meaningful"" life, when I am faced with an existential dread. But I can't do that anymore, nothing changes, and this will never end. I am extremely tired.

I have no one to be intimate romantically or sexually in my life. I am alone, and will die alone. I have not worked on developing those skills in the past 34 years, never dated, never had proper relationships, as I *worked* instead. To be open, I am a 34-years-old virgin, still trying to pass thinking sex as a taboo. Online dating sort of disgusts me - it makes me feel very weird swiping on people like I am shopping a commodity. I am still trying, but I never managed to keep an app in my phone over a week. So, I don't know where and how to find someone to share my life. The most meaningful thing these days has been, I had this crush for someone that I shouldn't (she is already in committed relationship for \~8-10 years) for the past \~1-1.5 years and developed this nice friendship. I feel very close to her and I can only wish to be with her in a parallel universe; but even in that case I am not sure if we are compatible, we think alike, I like talking to her very much, miss her, but never had much chances to spend time in the real life (we are online friends) and there are significant differences in how we have experienced life so far (I have been this child of a super conservative family who didn't roam free much, she has been this bubbly, free spirit character).

 I have been working in my current job for the past 5+ years. I am reasonably successful in my job, but it is very high stress environment. I managed to cope well, worked really hard, and made a name of myself in the company. Now, I have no interest in pursuing anything in this company. But I am unable to change jobs as well, since I have no interest in any of the other jobs and not sure what I can actually do. I can't also simply leave my job, as I am on a visa. If I resign, I need to go back to my home country, which will make my life considerably harder. I don't have energy for any of these, and I can't stop thinking about the corner I pushed myself to. 

In short, this became a bit too much in the past a few days and I haven't managed to leave my bed in the past couple of days. I have no intentions to leave it tomorrow as well, and my sleep is not in its best state. I have been in cycles of feeling absolute rubbish for years now, but I think I may be close to being done. Saying myself ""things will get better"" have no effect anymore and I am not sure how long I can try coping with all this further.  I don't think I am suicidal (too religious upbringing) but I don't know what to do anymore.

I just wanted to tell you my story in brief words, I don't know what I am expecting by writing all this. I am just tired and feeling extremely exhausted. Can someone end this?"
16-hour naps,6,ml8ejm,1,"I just woke up and I feel like shit. I don't mean to sleep for so long but it's just so nice taking a break from my life. Though the dreams that come with my sleeping habits are not my favorite, just passing through time without any awareness makes me so happy. I know it sounds cheesy, but if I could do this with my lover I think I'd never wake up. I just get so tired of being on the edge and being alone and having my flashbacks that sleeping just seems like the best way out of it. However, the consequences when I wake up are terrible (Empty tummy, raging headache, worried lover, and worried parents). Despite that, I still enjoy my 16-hour naps."
I'm tired of crying my eyeballs out every night and just hope to be dead the next morning,9,ml65pg,6,"I had so much potential, so many dreams, and I'm still so young, why I need to suffer like this? 

It's currently 4am here and one more night I can't sleep. 

I just wanted a hug. I don't have friends anymore cause I feel too worthless and annoying so I've pushed them away. My family won't help me either, as they are the main reason I'm like this.

Now I don't have any purpose to stay here, and that breaks my heart cause I don't want to die. I never wanted to die, I just wish I vanished like thin air, a weird memory, slowing going away in the mind of anyone who remembers my existence.

It hurts and I'm tired of the pain. 

I wished I believed in a higher force that gave me strength and hope but I don't. 

I have nothing left. I wish I could at least get some sleep right now."

Impossible situation with girlfriend who wants to die,1,mlk8hl,0,"Hi, I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for 2+ years now. She is severely depressed and very anxious. For a while now our relationship has not been great, but she knows I support her with all of her MH problems and have made myself available through a lot. She ended up in the hospital after taking a bunch of pills a few months ago, but it wasn't close to being toxic and so they discharged her. The other night, over a small event, she freaked out and sent me a bunch of goodbye texts. I went looking for her (we don't live together) at 1am and had the police out very quickly, we found her at the train station sobbing.. she had missed the last train. That night haunts me for many reasons, but genuinely believing she had ended it meant I was traumatically (I don't have another word for it) crying down every street in the pitch black, scared of what I may find. I was so worried I would see her body across the floor or hung up on a tree. I didn't know what to find but I went to all of our favourite places in the village and I feel so scarred by the night as a whole, it was like I had lost the entire world. I am feeling a multitude of things right now, but mostly I feel traumatised and trapped. That night did something to me (it was a few days ago) and now I just can't shake those feelings, I keep randomly crying remembering those feelings (I kept thinking how she was all alone when she did it and how scared she must be and it broke my heart). I feel so guilty in so many ways because I can't take the pain away. I feel lost as to how to help... On the flip side, I feel frustrated and trapped. Honestly, our relationship shouldn't have lasted (we aren't right together) this long, and we both know that. But our love and care for one another IS forcing us to stay together through her problems. I am okay with the idea of staying together long term if things work out, but I currently feel like I am in the relationship because I have to be rather than I want to be. Because, We both know that if this ended, she would go through with it. I am not here to be told to end the relationship, because I still love her and I am not going to let her be alone through this. I guess I kinda need to vent because I don't want the pain for her, but I am also aware the impact this is having on me and my life. I can't find a way out and the doctors are now saying I need medication to deal with my own anxiety. I can't talk to family / friends about this because I know they would try to make me break up with her, and that isn't an option for my conscience. I want to help her, I want to find a way to make us both happy but I feel so trapped and lost right now. Would appreciate any perspectives or advice. Thanks."
I want to die but I'm scared and I don't want to upset people I care about,3,mlc8hn,0,"I'm pretty mentally ill and can be crazy. I'm trying to do everything I can. On meds, trying to get therapy, quit drinking and drugs and doing exercise. I still have breakdowns and when I do I break things and go crazy. I have no control over it and I hate it. It hurts the people I care most about and they're getting worse. I really want to die cos I can't think of any other way of stopping hurting my friends and family but I know that'll upset them too. I really don't know what to do"
How long can social withdrawal last?,1,mlk6ef,0,My friend has been socially withdrawing for 2 months. Rarely replies or seem to enjoy conversations
"I need to vent, I only live for hope but I don’t think things will get better",1,mlk5d0,1,"I’m mostly writing this for myself just because I need to get my thoughts onto something right now. I think I have pretty bad depression, I’ve taken many tests online even if they are probably not legit they all say I have anywhere from moderate to severe depression. I don’t want to tell any close to me because I don’t want to bring them down with me but I need change soon because I don’t know how long I will last. Whenever I hear someone I know or look up to has depression I feel very sad for them and I don’t want people to feel the same for me. The pressure is just too much, I’m 15 and I have no idea what I want to with my life and I’m failing hard in school because I can’t focus online and got bad luck with my classes. I feel like I’m stuck in a downward spiral and it’s just gonna get worse until it explodes one day. I feel like I don’t have anything to live for except for hope. I met a girl a few months ago and she is really great, I’ve had many crushes before but there is something about her that feels different. It feels like my entire life I’ve been a walking corpse with googles on, but when I’m with her I feel true happiness for the first time and was at peace with myself. She has a great personality and we get along well. She obviously is very hot and she turns me on a lot but the best part about her appearance is her smile. I remember seeing her smile for the first time a few months ago and it honestly changed something in me, it was like an explosion happened in my heart. I over heard her say that she has depression and I cried for hours that night feeling so bad for her. I think I might Also have a sex problem because it’s all I think about if I’m not thinking about suicide and it’s really distracting. Anyway, hope is all I live for now but if I’m being honest with myself it probably won’t get better. Also, I’ve been having really weird dreams recently, most of them about her but some are about me jumping off a building. I really hope you guys have a good day"
im so exhausted and I dont even know how to begin to feel better,2,mlf03v,0,"shit changed a lot recently, breakups are hard but this one happens to come with extra confusing fuckin baggage. Im so tired from thinking and being anxious and I end up too tired to get out of bed by just driving myself insane with trains of thought that lead no where. someone put me in a fucking coma already."
I just don’t know anymore...,3,mlc2j2,3,"Hi, this is my first time posting anything on Reddit and I’m sorry but I just don’t know who to talk to or what to do anymore... I’m trying my best but slowly I feel myself slipping away. It sucks because I shouldn’t feel like dying when I’m right next to my daughter. My girl tells me she loves me but I don’t feel the love.. I’m trying my best by talking to my family about what’s going on but they act like it’s nothing or I’m just talking crazy until I lose my temper.. I hate that, they mean the world to me but yet I feel like they don’t care about me til I give something... prison opened up my eyes on who would really be there or who would pick up the phone.. I was locked up not for too long, but that whole time I didn’t receive one letter and the only one that picked up was my best friend. It hurts cause what if I was dead, how quick would it be for them to forget me.. it hurts because even when they were in the hospital, like my grandmother for example, I was the first one there. While everyone else didn’t even bother coming up.... depression runs on my mom side of the family and my dad has anxiety, so I know what to do when I have either one but it’s been getting to me lately and I’m scared.. I don’t wanna do anything that’ll make me lose my family.... I just wanna be okay again... and again I’m sorry for this post but I don’t know what to do anymore... 

thank you if you read this...."
"This year has been tough, thinking about moving back home",1,mlk0bv,2,"I moved for a job about 2 years ago. I like it in my new city but I have no doubt that I miss home. My family, my friends, the familiarity of it. The pandemic has made it harder but I can’t shake the feeling that even without it I’d still feel the same (perhaps not to the same degree, but still). I moved out here to experience something new and I have. There are parts that are incredible. But I miss the people back home and feel like my relationships with those people are suffering because of how far away we are from each other. 

I also feel like if I move home I’m giving up on growing and experiencing something different. Its definitely a more difficult life here and I think moving back will be admitting failure that I’m not cut out for it. At the same time I keep thinking I’m missing out on years of my life that should be spent with the people that I love the most (my family mostly)."
What is it about depression that is so comforting?,1,mljxea,0,"Everything that should make me feel better like working out or seeing friends or being productive is just soooo fucking hard for me. Like seriously, I feel so much resistance. I would rather go skydiving right now than finish this school task I have in front of me. What is it about being stagnant and suffering that's so comforting and seducing"
Is there ever a way out,1,mljvez,0,Typing this crying I just want to end it all there is no way out everyone's let me down In life all my friends my family and especially the mental health care system my therapist is manipulating and grooming me and my CPS worker fails to even try to help me
One little thing can ruin my entire day,3,mla1bm,3,"Today I accidentally cut in front of an older man at the bookstore. He was a good ways to the right, out of line, looking through a pile of books on the table and, after much debate, I assumed he was just browsing. But when my turn came, he waddled over and said otherwise. I apologized and let him retake his position, but he just yelled at me to pay attention in a cold, authoritative voice that‘s still ringing in my ears hours later. It took all my might to not wilt to the floor right then and there, and now I’m in my room unable to read or write or do anything I wanted to do today. I feel like a miserable waste and a pathetic, stupid person. I already know I’m going to stay this way for a while.
      
         
I hate myself. I hate that I get this way and I hate how much little moments like this hurt me. I wish I could stop the impact it has on me, but I can’t no matter how hard I try. I’m 22 years old and here I am just wanting to cry. Why do I have to get like this? Does anyone else felt the same way?

Also I apologize for the grammar and structure of this post. I’m a mess right now and this was done on my phone."

I finally understand the thoughts behind a suicidal person.,1,mljqe0,3,"I never thought this would happen to me. I really didn’t think it would happen during what should be a very happy time in my life— moving off to a new state, starting graduate school in something I love, getting started with my life. But now I finally get it. I thought I’d feel better once spring hit, but here I am only 10 feet deeper than I was before. I don’t know what’s going on with me. I can’t even cry about it to let any part of me feel real any more. I’m tired."
I think I'm having a nervous breakdown - too scared to leave my bed,1,mljiw4,1,"A few days ago I completely tapered off my SSRIS. This past week has been very tough for me. Alot of things went wrong, I fell sick, and my cat is dying due to an unidentified illness the vets can't figure out (viral gastritis that's just getting worse and worse). I'm trying my best with her, but those panic attacks and the terrified visits to the vet back and forth whilst I was sick myself really triggered a PTSD episode. I watched my mom die when I was 13, then my grandmother at 20 (who brought me up in my teenage years). I've had my cat for a year, and now watching her waste away (there's still hope. She may not die. But the vets have said her prognosis is guarded) has triggered my really badly. I'm also currently in a really bad family situation (which I can't escape for another couple of months.)
So all in all, I can't eat. I'm nauseous all day. Constant GIT issues. I can't get out of bed. I cry on and off all day. The idea of facing the world is terrifying me. I feel like I can't cope any longer. I don't know what to do or how to get past this. I don't wanna start meds again. But i need to know how to not be terrified of the world rn. My partner is stuck in another city due to quarantine (which is why I'm stuck with family, who are just toxic.) It feels like the world is crashing on me rn."
Ever feel guilty about being depressed?,1,mljhrp,0,"If I look around my life there are so many things to be grateful for. The world is full of cool things, and I want to see them but I feel so empty. I was raised in a very constricted environment and feel like my life has been built and set for me and I don't know if I actually like any of it. I feel too indebted to my parents to choose a different path and I don't even know how I would start. I've recently started therapy and meds for anxiety and lowkey depression, and I've struggled with being suicidal, bulimic, and anxious for pretty much my whole life. Every time I think things are about to actually get to the point where I am happy to be alive I get kicked down. Corona made me feel so lonely and put me back in my home environment, which wasn't exactly healthy. I was trying to get my life back together. I was sexually assaulted a week ago, so now I'm just so entirely over this whole existing thing. I want to love my life and be happy and see the world but I feel trapped and like the things that would get me out of this hole are unattainable."

I constantly feel like I’m drowning in my own pain,10,ml606x,1,"I’ve struggled with depression since 2009. I’ve never had anyone to really help me or talk to me about any of it. I’ve even contemplated suicide and almost tried it during my high school years. Never told anyone about it except for one person.. we haven’t talked in several years and they probably don’t even remember me anymore. Fast forward to now, I try to enjoy the little things in life. I have a few hobbies but no one to really discuss them with. So it’s just me. I (M) found someone (F) that I’ve enjoyed talking to. I told her everything there is to know about me and vice versa. I thought we were two peas in a pod. But my feelings for her made me end up losing her as she only saw me as a friend and now she won’t even talk to me anymore because I shared my feelings with her. She was truly the only person that understood me and made me feel safe. I’ve known her for several years but really only got back in contact with each other a few years ago. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I also suffer from bad body image issues. I abuse PEDs in order to make me feel somewhat better about myself but it just doesn’t matter.. no matter what I do, I’m still a loser. Can’t get the one girl I truly believed was “the one” to even care. My parents think I’m a loser. Everyone thinks I’m a loser. I have no one but the pain inside of me telling me that this is it for me and I will never find true happiness.

I sit here every single night questioning myself if my time will finally come to where I will become truly happy. It’s been 12 years. It hasn’t. I just don’t want to be alone anymore. I don’t want to be a waste of oxygen anymore. I want to be loved, successful, happy.

Are these changes permanent?,1,mliwgq,2,"So i got super depressed over quarantine. I had dealt with little bits in the past, but never anything that required actual medical help or interfered with work. but now it's very much at that point.

thing is, i feel like i've already seen behind the curtain, you know? i acknowledged how shitty a lot of things are, and even on the days the pills work, none of that shittiness goes away. It's just medication that i guess helps you forget about it? but it's still there in the back of my mind and then it feels like the effect of he medication is just... i don't know, arbitrary? like it's not fixing any problems, just helping you ignore it.

Anyways as i get closer to deciding to quit my job, i keep struggling with the idea that this is temporary, and maybe someday in a few months i'll magically revert back to how i was before then i'll have all the passion for work back. 

but idk if that will actually happen. have people made similar  decisions and ended up regretting it? or do you find usually your gut is right in these situations?"
I’m going numb,2,mldrvc,4,I’m starting to just not care anymore. I don’t want to be around. I’m all alone and no one understands me.

It doesn't even matter how intelligent I am. I will always feel this way, the pain doesn't stop. I was groomed to hate myself. To either always be sad or angry. I suppose I should commend the people in my life that led to this conditioning, it was a total success for them. Thanks. So much. I'm on a downward spiral, thinking things that nobody should ever have to. Like fantasizing that someone will end me, like fantasizing having a good day and then a freak accident ends me. I never asked to be born. I cannot beg people enough to really give a fuck and do their research before they decide to breed, but it doesn't matter what I say anyway. I'm so tired. I hurt in ways you don't see. Laugh at the fatass idiot you groomed into ED. Laugh at who you gave body dysmorphia to. Who you traumatized. Who you assaulted. I don't want to feel.

I can't even imagine being with another person betraying her (the imaginary person lmao)

im depressed af and i dont think i'll overcome it, im almost 20 btw, i know im young but heck

Life is shitty doesnt it, what a lame life i own, tf did i do in my past live to end like this

In November, my uncle died from complications of covid, and within a week I got it. It took nearly four months for me to start feeling okay again and I missed a lot of work in that time period and used up all of my paid leave. That meant that I was digging a hole financially. 

Since then my mental health has been in a downwards spiral to hell and I’m barely functioning at all, let alone at work. I miss so much work, and I don’t have the paid leave to back it up. My boss has been really patient with me, but I know he’s at his wits end and I keep having dreams that I lose my job.

I really don’t know what to do. I know the obvious answer is to suck it up and make it to work, but I can barely get myself to eat or move or shower. I know medication, therapy, just getting out of it, those are all answers, but they all take time and I don’t know how much I have until I’m out of a job."

I feel like people don't take me seriously just because I am a teen.,4,ml7yp9,1,it's like people see teens as a prep for adulthood rather than something real that has problems and someone needs to address them. my parents think that have complete control over me and I make sure that they will be crushed every time they start acting like it(basically they abuse me in multiple ways and I abuse back). my mom takes me not going to school more seriously than me ditching my therapist session. everyone acts like I don't know shit about anything and when you cross 18 you suddenly know everything. it's fucking annoying and limiting. I have attempted suicide is that not enough for them? 
How do you deal with things you do that uncharacteristic of you ?,1,mliavf,0,"So my depression and anxiety journey started last fall and things have been all over the place. 

My mood has improved but my memory is really shot and that causes me great anxiety spiralling down into fear and hopelessness. Before this, when i was severely depressed I did not really care about my memory was just waiting to die. So I took my memory for granted all these years and dont really have tools to handle this steep decline. I read and reread sentences to grasp them, better at comprehending text than conversations. When I talk to people they expect the former me. 

How do you deal with this ? Any coping mechanisms I could use at work ? 

Learning new things is also more difficult. It feels like I have to read many many articles  about a topic when I can say I can say I fully understand. So my comprehension time has increased 10 fold. 

What coping mechanisms for this ?

Lastly, when I am feeling better and optimistic, I tend to make some rash decisions which my be harmful to me financially. This one is the real scary one. How do I stop myself from ruining our finances and stop taking reckless financial risks ? 

I would greatly appreciate any advice you may have."
Inform work without them legally hamstrung,2,mld7es,5,"I have severe depression and lockdown has made it worse. At the moment I have 'migranes' when I'm actually having a debilitatingly bad day. 

The last place I worked at, my depression would regularly take me out. The HR team knew and were very supportive. Actually to a fault. You see, for a long period my work was sub par. Sometimes I couldn't come in for work and missed important meetings. It got to a point that no one wanted me on their projects because I was so incapable of being useful. If it were anyone else, they would probably have fired me. But I fear they couldn't fire me because they knew of my condition and they didn't want to open themselves up legally. It felt terrible.

My work now are getting the feeling something is wrong with me because my 'migranes' are causing me to lose enthusiasm and miss meetings. They even said that I showed massive improvement...the real me...when I put in a few weeks of normal work. I had just adjusted my medication but they didn't know that. They don't know I have severe depression.

I want them to be able to fire me if I am no longer useful, so I don't want to tell them the truth. But is there a way I can tell them and sign something that says it's ok to fire me, I won't pull unfair dismissal on them?"

I can’t focus on anything,2,mlcyre,2,"I don’t know if this is the right subreddit, I don’t even know if I have depression, but the point is that I constantly have thoughts about self harm or suicide and I can’t fucking concentrate on anything. I have so much homework for this week and I haven’t done shit because I feel terrible and everything is too difficult and drains too much energy, so I’d rather spend all my time scrolling mindlessly on social medias.

I am an engineering intern and I am for the most part a productive worker. I am a successful honor student (will graduate with Magna cum Laude honors) and I have a very loving and supportive girlfriend. The bad things that could be the cause of these symptoms are the following: 1.) Last March one of my cousins got murdered by her husband. 2.) My older sister found out that our younger bro (19 at the time) was molesting her second oldest son (our nephew); he is currently in jail on his way to prison I presume. 3.) My family are always at odds with each other and with the exception of my cousins funeral last year, I like never visit them, interact with them or do much of anything with them. 4.) This pandemic has restricted my ability to socialize with my colleagues like we normally would and I been working from home since last March and I am like ALWAYS in the house.

I had this 'moments' i guess once every two months? i can say with certain that i had a  similar feeling mid 2020, it was horrible, i hadn't any courage to do the simpler of things nor i had any joy in doing everyday stuff. Apart from now and as mentioned mid 2020 when i had it just was some intrusive thought or another, i have Maladaptive Daydreaming so perhaps there is a correlation to that now i'm feeling with doubt about happiness, something in my head keep saying that i'm not happy since long ago."

I was the one that got snippy, I was the one that closed myself, that let my insecurities control my actions, I was the one that was always fucking up everything.

And you know what the best part is? The part that got me laughing today? I can't fucking change this, I always fuck up somehow, I am one poor excuse of a human being and I will always be, some people just deserve to be alone, to be locked away and forgotten, and I am one of those people."
Feelings of guilt around depressed partner,2,mlc6yb,0,"Hi all,

My girlfriend has been depressed for about 6 months, a mixture of living alone, covid, and not feeling fulfilled in her job has left her feeling isolated and depressed. We are also in a 2000+ mile long distance relationship and see eachother about every 6 weeks for a few days at a time.

I've recently been struggling with feeling interested in the relationship and I feel so guilty for that. Almost every phone call feels exhausting and draining for me as I try to make conversation and receive very short answers, it's like she's totally checked out. She is trying to find help but struggling to do so for insurance reasons etc. She often describes feeling incredibly anxious and sad. I really do try my best to be there for her, and I'm worried because I can feel myself losing interest. She isn't the girl I fell in love with anymore.

I want to be there and continue to support her through this, but at times it feels very hard and like I'm forcing myself to.

I don't want to bring this up and add to her emotional state, I know she is already aware of this at some level and feels bad enough.

Has anyone else been on either side of a similar situation?

Thanks for reading, have a great day!"

Just need to get it out because I have no one to talk to,1,mlh3w2,1,"I am having a really bad time right now and my self-esteem is hitting rock bottom. On the surface, I'm a high functioning person - I'm a graduate student in a good school with a resume that people would dream of. But in reality, a lot of my accomplishments and overachieving arose from attempting to garner love and praise from any teacher or peer willing to provide. I grew up in a house of poverty and emotional abuse and academic success was all I had.

I've sacrificed everything and busted my ass to get where I am. But at the end of the day, isolated in my room as I work my job for 5 hours, attend online classes at a university I've never visited in person and have no real friends in, and do assignments everyday until 2/3 am, I feel like life isn't worth living. 

Before, I pushed everyone away to prioritize my education and career. Now in the pandemic, I've pushed everyone away because I think I inherently don't deserve love. I think once they find out how much I hate myself , my tumultuous emotions, and the depth of my depression, I will be rejected. And why subject others to someone like me, someone so undeserving who would just waste their time and efforts only to be disappointed when they can't save me. It's easier this way. 

I'm still stuck in the house with my controlling family. This was the year I was supposed to move away and finally go to school on the other side of the country. I would finally be free and be happy and bare the fruits of my labour. Now, things have changed. Instead, I feel like I'm trapped into eternal high expectations and perpetual grinding effort for minimal personal reward. I'm so sad to wake up every day to high pressure work and constant feelings of inadequacy. I spend days alone in my room working away and when I'm with my boyfriend, I'm always working and stressed. I've gained weight. I've become bitter and ugly. I've become someone I never wanted to be."
College sucks,6,ml6fb2,0,"Ive never felt so damn lonely in my life. I hate my major. I am terrified to pursue my interests. I judge myself before I even give anything a try. I live vicariously through the apps on my phone. Nothing feels real. Everything is just worrying about the next due date and me procrastinating until said date because there’s so much more to life than getting A’s. I am tired. I am mentally drained. I am sad.

But even after acknowledging all this Im still just going to go back to doing the same things over and over again. Continue to be a mindless zombie that can memorize information and regurgitate it the second I don’t need it.

How can I end this agonizing flow of life and finally do something different."

I am sick and the doctors are just calling me fat,1,mlgx67,2,"I'm feeling unwell since last year, this is not the depression, I know it cause I've been depressed for over 12 years, this is something else entirely, I'm always aching like I have the flu but I have no fever or anything else, my bones hurt, I'm always fatigued as if I had run a marathon, but I clearly didn't , it's come to a pint were it is messing with my life, and when I go to the doctor they just say I'm fat and try to imply I must eat too much or too badly, the truth is I rarely eat out, i most eat home cooked meals and yes, I've been overweight for a while as at the worst of my depression tent to overeat, but I know my body, and this feels unlike anything I've felt before. I'm not here looking for answers, as I know this is not remotely the place for that, but I just feel so depressed now because of the constant dismiss of my symptoms by my doctors, it is like they are not listening to what comes out of my mouth... I'm in pain constantly and I don't know what to do, and like always my brains first reaction is to think about ending my life cause right now I cannot figure out another course of action. I'm currently taking my meds as prescribed and I've been emotionally estable for a while now... But this situation right now is beyond me, and I'm so tired of keeping my head straight and dealing with the doctor's making me feel like shit when I already feel like the biggest shit in the planet....

Looking for any help with some career advice?,1,mlgwrf,0,"Curious how other people have handled this sort of situation.

I feel like i've run out of things to try, but i'm pretty worried since dropping out is a one-way street in most cases."
I'm so unwanted,5,ml74h9,2,"No one is ever gonna want me or love be (besides my parents). I hate my life, even though I'd be deemed so lucky to have what I have. I hate being me.

But yeah, most of all rn, I just want to be wanted by someone. I don't want to be someone's last choice, or only choice... but that's what I am. No one would choose me if they could have someone else.

I'm so tired of this. If my parents weren't alive, I would kms. I'll never have a good life, I'll always be alone and I'll have to see everyone around me be happy with their SO's, and move forward in life.

Life in this World=Depression & Death,1,mlgrmd,0,"We've all had dreams, goals, ideals for the future, and yet almost no one ever reaches them. This is because the world is not made for dreams. It is made to put you into a system that breaks you down to a slave; who will do anything to support the people in power's dreams, while you can only try to stave off starvation and loneliness. No one cares about anyone, everyone is a disgusting, self-centered, envious, narcissistic, self-absorbed piece of scum sucking trash. No one cares about how you want to live your life, they only want people to be as miserable and dissatisfied with their wasted lives as they are, and nothing will ever change that. I've wanted to do one thing in life, and yet at every turn I am barred from it, and forced along a path of supplication and servitude. If I cannot live the life I truly desire with every fibre of my being, than I should just kill myself; after all what is the point in living life, if it is not a life you wish to live?"

But anyway, I’m 25 and feel like I haven’t lived. I haven’t traveled the world, I haven’t had sex yet, I haven’t done anything. I’m trying not to be so angry and frustrated with life but I am. I really am. All I know is trauma and pain. I’m just now seeing a psychiatrist about things that happened years ago that affect me to this day. I feel like my entire life has passed me by and that I’ll never be happy. I feel like I’ll never have stories to tell or experiences to share. I don’t have friends. I won’t sit here and say it’s other people. It’s me. All I’ve ever wanted was a friend but everyone always leaves, so anyone that comes into my life, I immediately cling to them. I swear I try not to, it’s just that I’m so desperate for a friend that I become overly dependent to the point where it most likely suffocates them :(

I thought I was finally okay... I was wrong.,1,mlgj2i,5,"Before writing this I was doing absolutely great. After years upon years of endless self-hatred I finally thought the battle was over. The past few days I haven't been doing well at all, even worse then my past battle. I don't want to die, but I sure as hell don't want to live with the pain anymore, I just want to be happy again. That past month was the best days I can remember, going out, having fun, being back to myself... But now? I've just been thrown back down even further. Most people have friends that if they had seen them standing at the top of a building getting ready to jump, would do everything in their power to stop them and that is beautiful to see but if the tables were turned, it only causes an immense amount of pain knowing that no one would even try to stop me. I can't take it, everytime I walk out of my room, someone has to comment on ""how terrible I look"" I know I look like absolute shit. I don't need someone to remind me. I'm sick of having mental breakdowns, I'm sick of dealing with being super sad everyday. I'm sick of people calling me ""lazy"" because I don't get my work done. I'm sick of feeling like I ""fake"" depression for attention. I don't fake it but it feels like it everytime I try to get shit off my chest. Talking doesn't clear my mind, it only fills it more. I'm just done with everything. I'm done trying to be nice to everyone, I'm done talking to people. No one noticed the tears, no one noticed the pain, no one noticed that I'm not actually me anymore, but they all notice every single mistake I've made and never drop it. I'm sorry for being who I am, I'm working everyday to try and change it as I hate myself just as much as everyone else hates me. I just want to be someone else so atleast one person will care about my well being, even if they are faking it. I just want one person who I can call my friend to share memories with is that too much to ask? I guess so..."

If I'm depressed, then that is a normal and valid reaction to being such a shit awful human being. I'm just a talentless, joyless, awful person and that is what creates so many problems for myself and other people. My life would be fine if I was literally anybody else but no, I had the bad luck to exist as the shitty subhuman that I am. I wish I could feel better, I honestly do, but I'm keenly aware that that would require being a completely different person which unfortunately can't happen. I'm pretty much stuck like this, so I'm not quite sure what I can even do at this point. The part of my life where I could achieve relationships or success is basically over so I have nowhere to go from here."
At what dose did Amitriptyline start working for you?,1,mlggpj,2,"I take Amitriptyline for 3 months now and had no effects or relief in depression, pain or anxiety at all. I’m also in a behavioral therapy. My doc just increased my dose from 100 to 125mg 5 days ago and told me that we can increase to 150-200mg max if it still doesn’t give me any effects and relief/improvements of my symptoms. I hope that now on 125mg it will have some effect.

At what dose did Amitriptyline start working for you regarding depression and anxiety or mood, motivation/energy, sociability and such? Is it possible that 125/150/200mg will help me if 100mg didn‘t work for me?

What do the effects of Amitriptyline feel like for you? What changes did you notice regarding mood, energy/motivation, sociability, talkativeness and anxiety?"

I try to think things are going well and will turn out fine and it all blows up in my face. It all goes wrong. I keep letting myself try to think positively but every time I get knocked down again. Every kick in the teeth hurts more than the last.

I can keep trying to delude myself that I mean anything to them, that I mean anything to anyone. Keep trying to convince myself and believe that I am deserving of love, that they might change their mind and love me again, that anyone could ever love me.

I didn't even deserve them before and I am even less deserving now. They always shined in comparison to me but now they are the sun compared to my dying flashlight glow. A glow that dims more every day. Paling as I disappear while you only grow brighter, eventually my light will go all the way out and I will be gone. 

Until then I will just keep going through the motions, living inside my delusional mind, revisiting the times when everything didn't feel like this, even just for a moment. Fighting against the shadows inside my own head that threaten to extinguish the light faster still than it was already fading."
Should I just quit my current job,5,ml6u5l,0,"27. Been working since I'm 18. I get fired 50% of the time. Through the years I got diagnosed, there's a clear pattern of illness getting worse over time.

I'm having a rough moment in life. I've just been taking my med and forcing myself to sleep since last weekend (anti-depressant that makes you sleep, not recreational drugs). Lots of dreaming so it's not like I'm resting while sleeping. I've basically been bedridden since last friday and only recently I'm coming out of bed and my back hurts but that's another story.

I can't work like this, I haven't worked at all for the last two weeks. I just pretend I'm working. Job is definitely taking me to the edge, superiors have started making demands and scolding me because of my fault.

This has been my fault, I've stopped seeing my doctor for a while, now he doesn't want me as a patient. I've tried to force myself to be employed through this hell and I only keep a job for some weeks only to get fired. I actually wish I was in the psych ward right now. Last week I was going to start crying and my mother just told me to fuck off and cry somewhere else. I'm back to living with parents and I can't expect support from them, they're doctors, they shouldn't have to put up with this, I recognize that.

Right now I just wish I had nothing to worry about. I don't even care about financial ruin.

I don't even know how to quit, I have lots of pending very important reports."

Then, I discovered that there's an entire group talking shit about me; hell people I held close and trusted which I don't even do but like a dumbass, I had done that shit again. people were saying I cheated on exams, they were saying that it was impossible for me to get the grades I did get before, and every time. Academics are the only thing I have always been good at and it was so hurtful hearing people talk about me like that. They didn't know my grades, they didn't know my standards, because they have never even spoken to me. It shouldn't affect me but it does, it does so bad, because where do I put in my trust now, with what belief now, they were talking shit about every single thing I do, how do I cope with it, idk, but now I wish I could slice my chest."

Losing your best friend,1,mlfwno,1,"Hey everyone, 

My ex girlfriend was the first person I ever truly fell in love with. We met when I was 21, and dated for 2 years. Since then we’ve become best friends and she means the absolute world to me. I admire this person a lot, and there is no one with whom I have so many laughs so effortlessly. We hangout multiple times per week! 

She is moving away, and I’m pretty devastated. I’m already struggling with depression and anxiety, and the thought of my best friend being gone is horrifying. I feel so sad yet so empty. 

Has anyone lost a friend in this way? I know we are still friends, but not getting so see one another anymore is so tough for me. She’s my rock. How do you handle the sadness and pain associated with this kind of change in life? I’m lucky enough to say I haven’t dealt with this kind of experience until now."

I’m so hopeful that it’ll help but at the same time, I’m fearful I’ll go through more therapy and once again not experience progress.

I've had depression or maybe it's more of some existential dread (I believe that's the right term) for a long time now not because of covid or anything it's just my brain and how it works I also have adhd which i'm sure probably doesn't help but over the years i've noticed I was heading in a downward spiral in my life it's like i've just lost my meaning of life or like my will to live I also have noticed how shaky my hands are like I can't just SIT or stay still and keep my hands steady it's controllable but it's just something i've noticed about myself along with my immense indecisiveness. I just don't feel happy, sad, or, sympathy/empathy like i'm meh(ing) through my life like in a limbo hell of my own making I used to do all of my work and i'm not dumb i've just lost like my work ethic and I feel like i'm always behind and always having to catch up because I can't keep my work pace with people and I say I don't need help because I don't want to burden anyone and I know if I ask they'll just tell me that I need to actually do the work and In the end I just don't end up doing it out of laziness and the feeling that it doesn't matter. Honestly I don't know anymore and I don't know why I just can't fill this void or hole in my heart like a part of me is missing and I can't get it back. I've talked to therapist before but they haven't helped so instead I thought of seeking help from maybe like minded people"

Why didn't I talk to you sooner. Why did I wait before it was to late. Why can't I change everything and have made everything right. I should have I could have I would have. But I didn't. I can't talk about you to my other friends. It hurts to much. They don't understand. They won't understand. The pain of losing someone doesn't go away. The guilt slowly kills you in side. All I feel is heart break. I don't deserve to live. It's not okay. I wasn't a friend when you needed me to. I let you down. I'm sorry. I let you down. I let my self down.."
I just want to end this vicious cycle,3,ml8h5j,1,"

I’ve been trying to fix my shit for five years.
I’ve been to numerous psychiatrists who never understood. I never got a proper diagnosis. 

2 weeks ago I decided to give it another shot and get diagnosed, I was prescribed a medication and when I took it, it was the worst night in my life. I literally couldn’t breathe, my blood pressure dropped and I was unable to move and I felt so cold. I wished to die for the pain to end. I contacted my psychiatrist and told him but he just told me to lower the dose...
Bitch I was literally dying, I shouldn’t even take 1/2 a pill again. 

I don’t feel like I want to try again. I just want to be done. This is too much shame, guilt and pain and I really want some peace just for a month

I never had a full month without being shamed, without depression or any problem with my dickhead father who threatens to kill me..


I just want to die. I really do. I’m just so squeamish and timid to do anything.."
Keep scrolling,13,ml1ac8,2,"Im feeling down. I cant stop thinking about how no one will fall for me. If so ill probably just ruin it. Im uninteresting and have no worthwhile skills. I get sudden bursts to turn my life around, then i fail. Im sitting here contemplating everything and why i have friends. They have other friends. So why do they need me. I hate myself and all the teasons for me to keep living are gone. So why cant i just do it. this world is horrible, so why stay. I needed to say this. No need to interact or anything. This is just a rant."
I Lost All of my Motivation. Missing The Pain,3,ml8gw7,0,"I realize now that I never really had much motivation to do anything in my life. Maybe it’s because I was spoiled as a kid but in 11th grade I asked my grandma to give me pills so that I could force myself to focus in 12th grade since I knew it would be extremely busy and in 11th grade I barely had any homework but some days was still stressed. 

There’s always been something wrong with me. I think I’ve realized that since as early as 3rd grade. I’m different... maybe I’d hide it behind me being a nerdy kid but no... something was off. And my moms side of the family has a mental illness that comes through the family. But she’s adopted and I’ve roughly noticed every member of my moms side of the family is off to some degree... most at least. 

Going into 12th grade I was even more busier than I originally thought I’d be. But I managed everything AMAZINGLY the first 3 months. I did everything I was supposed to do and if I had kept going would’ve probably gotten into a top tier school and gotten amazing grades. 

But at this point in my life I downloaded an app. This app was a social network. I made many friends on it was apart of many groups and it controlled my day to day life. I would talk in class outside of class all day every day I was addicted. I remember being able to last hours just communicating to people. 

However, things ended HORRIBLY. Idk if it was my illness that made me mess things up or if it’s all in my head and they were the reason. But I’ve realized that if I get a shit ton of friends and all end horribly that to some degree it’s probably my fault. Idk if this was the trigger to losing all my motivation but I remember one day studying for my SAT and then just getting a huge trigger not an anxiety attack but just pains in my head and Body. 

After this event I was done for. I think a huge part of this is the psychological effects that app and those people had on me whether it was my fault or not. To this day I feel I’m hiding myself to some degree to fully realizing what happened and blocking myself from the pain. But ever since then I’ve had no motivation. 

I work 3 days a week 10 hours maximum this job similarly to the school thing is starting to impact my mind in negative ways. I feel that same pain in my head and stomach and it scares me because if I have a similar event to what happened in school I’m afraid I’ll make myself even worse than before.

I wanted to quit but my family said Dont because 1 it will be hard to find another job after quitting and 2 I can’t stay there without a job. There’s so much going on why can’t I just take a few months to refresh my brain?? At the point I’m going I’m going to crash. 

I read an article and apparently they say it’s not being unmotivated or lazy but it’s fear. And I’ve realized that’s the exact feeling I feel. I can’t dedicate long periods of time doing specific things because it scares me as if I’ll somehow miss out on something or like I have something to do very very soon that’s impacting that event. Because of this it’s effected even some hobbies like video games. I can’t dedicate long periods to one game or ill get bored or anxious. 

But after reading this I feel better knowing it’s just fear. I do think at times it is pure boredom. I feel I’ll enjoy myself doing something else than what I’m doing but other times it’s definitely fear. The impact of these events are rooted deeply inside of me. These events started in 2017 and ended in 2019. And they are still effecting me and there... I just refuse to think about it and claim I’ve moved on when infact I’m just hiding it. Sometimes I remember old things and part of me longs for that pain again.... 

I want to return to those days they sucked but I felt alive... sometimes I think about going back to the app and trying to find all the old people but i realize it’s been soo long they’ve probably forgotten about me or don’t have the app anymore. Or stuff will happen again that will trigger me even more and fuck me up. 

I think about the fact that this is probably holding me back and I need to accept what happened except for denying it and move on but when I think about doing that my brain hurts. I feel these events were so important yet they weren’t. They took place online entirely and were just random people but my brain is convinced it is EVERYTHING and the more time passes the worse it gets because I realize how much I fucked up and miss those days so much."
Feeling toxic,4,ml68kb,0,"do you ever catch yourself being incredibly short tempered, rude, and sarcastic when having a depressive episode?

I am struggling to cope. I don't see much of a way out anymore.,2,mlag9q,0,"I'm tired of fighting. I feel very stuck due to my mental health and don't see much of a way out anymore. I don't want to tell any friends/family because I am ashamed and don't want them worrying anymore.

I am 26. I was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder at around 14 after a trauma, and have constantly struggled with it ever since. I also have ASD. That's half my life of the same bs. No matter what I do, nothing gets any better for long, despite supportive people and so many great steps that I have made. I am tired of fighting.

I've seen two psychologists since I was a teenager who helped me manage and become not only very emotionally intelligent but also functional in day-to-day life, through CBT, counselling, hypnotherapy, etc. I even had a period about 2.5 years ago of around 6 months of actual happiness and bliss in my life. But my mental health rollercoaster never stays in one position for long.

I've tried so many different medications and dosages (my GP is great and supportive). Some work a little bit for a time. Others don't. Most give me dreadful side effects. I have functional, healthy relationships, two parttime jobs I enjoy, friends, a decent diet, etc. There is no clear reason why I should be feeling how I do.

Yet over the last 9 months I have slipped again and it's gotten to the point where I am feeling exhausted with it all. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm on repeat, enjoying nothing, only getting up because I have to. I drive to work and dissociate, fantasising about accelerating into a powerpole. I don't want to tell my family/friends anymore because I just feel like a broken record on repeat. 

I can't afford to see my psychologist or a psychiatrist (even with the referrals that I do have) because I don't work long hours due to my mental health (I get very fatigued very fast). My medication is expensive too. I now struggle getting up each day, being bothered to shower, or even eat. 

This time is different. I've had heaps of absolute worst low moments, where I'm emotionally distraught for months on end. This time I'm just hopeless and exhausted. I don't see a fix. I don't want to ask for financial help because I feel ashamed to. I feel like asking for help is implying that I think my money is more important than my family's money. I feel stuck and needed somewhere to vent because I'm not aure what more I can do, so thanks for reading and letting me get all this out."
How do you live for yourself?,6,ml59tv,2,"Get ready for some real glass-half-empty shit...

People always say “you have to live for yourself” or “happiness comes from within”, but how does that even make sense? Everything you do is for someone else, even if it’s for someone you don’t know yet. Your wealth, money, and overall success — isn’t it all just for the purpose of creating a life worth sharing, and a legacy worth passing on?

Where is the part of my life that I’m supposed to live for me? I’ve repeatedly come back to suicidal thoughts, so much so that the only thing stopping me from ending it all at this point is the fact that I don’t want to hurt the people I care about in the process. At this point, I feel like a puppet on strings.

So for those of you out there who *have* found happiness from within, where did you find it? And how did you finally reach it?"

Problem with my parents and depression,1,mlf1kl,0,"Hey guys,

So I've always felt it. You know. Nothing was fun anymore, could never go to sleep because of those voices in your head, the works. Even as a child I faked the smiles so much I can even fool myself.

Here's some backstory: My parents adopted me from MI at about 10 days old. They were around 52-53 at the time and I was only 10d old (My birth mom was avid drug user of multiple drugs and I was experiencing side effects\[shaking, etc.\]). These people who adopted me are one of the families from the Detroit numbers running books in 1958. They set things up that I have told them multiple times I was not comfortable with, including trying to hook me up with someone without my knowledge or consent and burying my grandmother WITHOUT CLOTHES ON IN A CARDBOARD COFFIN. They did not notify me of her death or her burial. They also own a unlicensed gun (.42 shotgun) with several boxes of bullets.

Now, the depression has always been there. I have recently discovered my adoption records (the originals and the copies) in their possession as well as a copy of the birth record and doctors notes. It was written and underlined. Genetic 82/100 depression. I finally found out why I felt this way.

I brought up my depression with them and they did not even want to hear it, nor would they explain why they never took me to therapy so that I could feel better. They even went so far as to flat out deny I had had it and the past few years they have done nothing but mentally abuse me. My mom went so far as to be my supervisor's supervisor at my job to make sure I don't tell anyone else AND connected our bank accounts. Anytime I want to bring anything up now they cut me off. I almost didn't finish high school and I left college after a semester because it just overloaded me. I have problems concentrating and I can blank out for hours without realizing it. I have done things and made promises that I do not remember making. I am not sure if this is after effect of the above or if something else is wrong with me.

I'm so tired of it all. There was a scalpel that I hid somewhere in my room so that I won't get tempted. I never self harmed. I don't plan to. But those of you like me know when that quietness gets to loud how different you become. I want to use this kind of platform as a safe haven. If my friends so happen to be on the internet, so be it. Sometimes I might not post/reply for a while, though.

I don't want to be alone. but even right now as I'm typing this, my mind tells me that pushing others away is somehow saving them (?) Don't know what that means quite yet. But it feels a little better getting this stuff sorted out. Maybe somehow I can get right with my parents. Thanks for listening."
Family issues,1,mleuzv,0,"My father died of ALS last December, and it’s taken about every last toll on my mind leading up to it, anticipating the moment that I wouldn’t have a father anymore. Going through COVID, having to live on my own far away from him, not being able to talk to him... and not wanting to talk to him anyway. There was anger, guilt, sadness, all eating away at me and my life was already Hell as is, he was never there for me or my sister when we needed him most. And the news of him dying only made me feel more disconnected. He tried to re-enter our lives the year before in a last bid attempt to make up for lost time, but we were adults in our 20s by then. And then all this happened. Now we’re considered cursed by his family because we couldn’t drop our responsibilities and drive all the way up to New York to take care of him when it just simply wasn’t possible, how was I gonna take care of him when I didn’t even have the heart the talk to him.. My shitbag of an uncle also coerced him into re-writing most his will into his name and taking me and my sister out, out of spite for us since we weren’t there for him, even though he was, and still didn’t show up to take care of my father, he just wanted the money, the valuables. Makes me believe he never once gave a shit about him. Maybe I am an awful son for the way it ended, I think about my own life and who I am every day for it. But I don’t need to be told that by a vulture. I hope if my Dads somewhere that he can forgive me. Life has just not been easy, and sometimes I think of taking my life because of how awful it feels, and it doesn’t go away.

Rant Incoming

Ever since in Middle School, I feel like I've put my parent's happiness ahead of my happiness. I've first encountered depression and Suicidal thoughts. I told my counselor and she contacted my Step-Dad (1st year for him of being a step-dad) and he came to my school. My dad called my mom, but she said she was too busy with her work to come and support me. After school, I told her my feelings about suicide and she basically reacted with ""lol"". Ever since then I've hated my mom and my life. In high school I was forced to do sports that I didn't want, and failed one of my classes (im a dumb cookie). We moved and I decided to get my shit together academically wise, not emotionally and mentally right. Granted I still saw my counselors, but that was no help tbh. I was getting good grades for the first time in my life. However, this was not enough for my mom's approval. She was asking: Why aren't you taking AP classes? Your friend or her friend's daughter or son got into a UC and you can only muster to get into CSUF? All my life and still am living for my family. I took 2 years of medical studies in HS because my mom and my family wanted me to take it, still did sports that I didn't want. On top of that constant verbal abuse from my mom like complaining how I wasn't good enough academically, how I was the reason for the divorce, and how I was the reason that we came to America. Constantly belittling me and my life. Now in CSUF, I major in CS which was 50/50 on major deciding. I'm a first year and I can tell you that I loath this major, but my mom and my grandparents are telling me to stay in it. This morning I decided I'm done fighting for myself and my happiness. I'm just going to live for my family, and in the future live for my wife.

Tbh, I'm just tired. Every night I'm restless because I'm stressed about my school (currently taking 16 creds, took 17 last sem) and my work that I work 20 to 21 hours a week, that I feel like suicide is the only way out and the only to tell my family that I'm was not happy. That for once in my terrible life they will listen. When I stab myself on the chest or my heart, I can die in peace and with a smile on my face. Finally being able to take something in my control in my life. I apologize for this graphic, but this is how I feel. However, I can't kms because even though I hate my fam, I can't do that to them. Even when I want to kms, I don't save myself because I love myself, but I don't do it for them.

I want to apologize for the long read and for wasting your guy's time if guys didnt want to read it. I just needed to get this out of my chest. This was my first post btw so its not that good 😅😅.

edit:I know its very selfish of me to rant about these small inconveniences, and I should be thankful for going to CSUF. Sometimes I am a gen-z snowflake,"
I am so alone:),5,ml6ixx,2,"I have zero friends irl or online; I finally started going to school about a month ago with the hopes that i’d meet new friends, but no one reciprocates interest in being friends with me no matter how hard I try with them:) it’s honestly pathetic on my part! 
I have my mom, but she’s out of town a lot. Also just got out of a 5 year relationship and i’m feeling like i’ll be alone and without true love for the rest of my life. 
No one loves me or has loved me the way I love them. 
There’s honestly not one single part of me that wants to be alive! Feels like things never actually truly get better:) I am constantly so overwhelmed and upset and my brain is so tired. I want to give up."
Should i end it because of vision loss?,1,mle3k3,11,"I dont think living blind is worth it, especially if you already have other disabilities.

Incredibly down.,2,ml9kdr,0,"
From a high paying, high alert job to struggling in the 1 year lockdown. Thinking of giving up my 8 dogs whom Ive cared for so much in 6 - 2 years. Recently quit a job due to toxic boss as i am the manager of the team, teammates felt were being attacked unnecessarily. In January, fixed my dad’s problems and he ended up leaving my rented apartment due to sadness at home. 350 + job applications passing interviews but only three great job offers that did not push thru. Was offered a best position by a controversial politician but my morals dont align. Now, i suffer. Too much pride? Must be my line of work and the values it taught me. Must be over caring for people and not leaving something for myself. Must be too much idealism. I got depressed, went to therapy the whole lockdown. Sought only close family member I have but I think hed like for me to figure things out on my own. Planned to use my savings in my masters studies but ended up in the pandemic cage. Worst time to be alive. Sometimes i think of just resetting life and leaving this world. Writing here seems to be the only safe space. To everyone reading, thank you in advance for any thoughts. Let’s all take care."
I just wasn't made for these times..,1,mle1eh,3,Anyone else ever feel like that?
New job blues,1,mle04g,2,"So some of you might remember my post about me kicking a hole in the wall the other day. I did lose the job. I was put on another post though. I’m in a weird mix of depression from hating it and trying to accept the consequences of my own actions. The new post I’m at is a huge commute and was less posh then I was at. I told my parents we lost the account, which we very well might, and I got put at a new place. They didn’t understand why I was so upset. Idk what to do. This is the best job I’ve ever had. Which is not a high bar. And I don’t think I’ll get one as good.

But one of the main reasons for posting this is that I feel like I need to stay here. To punish myself for messing up so bad and causing so much trouble for my company"
Freaking out,1,mldy0s,3,"It's currently 1:04am on a Wednesday and I just got back inside after talking to my mother. My mother can be stubborn and idiotic and her actions affect everyone, including me.

I asked my mother if she wanted to go out and get something to eat and she agreed. This was around 9-10pm, a few hours ago. I texted her and she didn't respond. I get worried very easily so I kind of just spammed here. I usually think irrationally and I can't really control it(?). Anyways, I figured that she must've been asleep after an hour and tried to get some sleep. Then she texted me.

She came over an hour after the text and I went downstairs. I realised that she was exhausted. She asked me if I wanted to drive (I don't even have my learner's licence) and I immediately refused. We got into the car and she kept falling asleep next to me.

I started freaking out and telling mum that I didn't wanna go and that she should just go home and sleep, that she was falling asleep at the wheel and it wasn't safe. She ignored me. She told me she wasn't even tired and like- I'm not an idiot.

After some arguing I told her I'm going back inside and she got upset, saying she wanted me to come and help her. She wanted me to tell her to slow down when she got too fast and keep her focused. I refused, and I feel like an idiot about it. I told her to go home before she ends up killing herself and walked inside.

I'm scared that's the last conversation I'm going to have with my mother. The last 'i love you'd I'll hear from here. Should I have gone with her and helped her? I feel awful for saying no.

I'm stressing out. I feel like crying. This isn't the first time this has happened either and I hate it."
Finally Confronted My Abuser And My Heart Is Shattered,9,ml1kac,2,"I couldn’t take it anymore after 20 years of being abused I finally broke and confronted my “parent”and I’ll  probably be hurt for the rest of my life by what he said to me.

My father who was my main abuser denied EVER physically abusing me(the abuse ranged from beatings all the way to smothering and threats) and said That I was lying and that the only thing he said was that I have an ugly attitude and hurt his feelings by not saying I love you back. He also said that everything he did was to make me stronger and during the confrontation was acting Like he was going to hit me but was stopped by my mom

Im so hurt and feel so stupid! I wasted 20 years of my life practicing filial piety, hoping that people would love and trust me one day, and trying to live up to the things that are expected from me as my parents child in my culture for nothing! For my abuser to look me in the face and swear to god that he has never and would never abuse me. I have to live with all of these memories for the rest of my life and for what! What did I do to deserve this!?! I just wanted to be loved and I tried so hard for nothing. I’m so hurt my heart isn’t broken it’s literally shattered."
I feel hopeless and I need some help.,2,ml9d9p,0,"i live a pretty average life—better than most actually. but honestly? i’m so tired of everything and especially myself. i live life through escapism as it’s the only thing that really makes me feel anything. i’ll watch anime or read, and maybe i’ll laugh, i’ll smile, and feel good, but without it i feel almost empty. everyday feels so hopeless—everything feels like a struggle. i get anxious over the future often and fret about what i have and haven’t done. i often feel as if i’m failing or am a failure despite the fact that i haven’t really failed. i sometimes have this physical weight on my chest because of how useless i think i am.

despite my circumstances i feel as if i can’t turn to anyone. my father and i have a terrible relationship, and i don’t want to burden my already struggling mother. i don’t feel like any of my friends would care to understand, nor would they know what to say. i don’t feel like i have any relationships meaningful enough for this. 

often times i’ll even invalidate my own feelings and will convince myself i’m doing this for attention. despite the fact that no one really knows. and this feeling of irrational guilt makes me feel worse. i’ll even have a difficult time falling asleep.

i’m only 17 but i feel as if i’m crumbling. i don’t want to die, but i don’t want to be burdened with existence. i know that i should be lucky, i’m alive and well. that i’m privileged enough to make a post on here. but i’m truly so tired. please help me i don’t understand"
can you *really* overcome depression?,36,mktvgi,18,"I really don't have the energy to talk about what i'm feeling or used to feel but i think after getting help for a year and having some great months right after i'm on the edge to be depressed again about same issues i had before. So i wonder, do we really ever overcome depression"
Who were you before the labels?,1,mldr37,3,"Who were you before people started to define you with labels?

Meds,1,mldp6n,2,"I was on antidepressants for 5 years. It has now been 6 months without meds and I made it through a tough withdrawal phase. I decided to get off them to avoid relying on a substance which is changing the structure of my brain. Long-term, it’s not something that I want in my body. 

Naturally, my motivation is down and my depressive symptoms are back up. What are your experiences with how long it takes to return to a “baseline”? Or is this it...? Thanks."
Struggling with my wife understanding,1,mldmf5,0,"About 3.5 years ago we moved back to my hometown from Seattle which I really loved. Since moving back my depression has gotten much, much worse and I don't know how long I can keep living here.  I really just hate everything about here, but I digress.  

I had a memory on my Facebook page in Seattle where I looked happy and told my wife ""Look how happy I was"" and her response was ""well you thought about killing yourself in Seattle so you weren't that happy there anyways.""

I've struggled with depression since some traumatic stuff happened when I was a teen and have always had some type of occasional suicidal thoughts in the back of my mind that I work on blocking out and therapy to help. So yes, I did have those thoughts, but they were very infrequent and honestly I was the happiest I ever was. I still struggled with my darker thoughts and several months in a row where I would be really struggle with depression, but they were more infrequent and I was able to get back to a normal state quicker and was able to feel happy or at least content the other 8 months a year.

But being here has really put me in a spot where I'm struggling to even have one ""good"" day here where I don't feel like a mess and the infrequent bad thoughts I had are a way more common occurrence since moving here and it's been a struggle.  And it feels like she doesn't want or care to ask how I feel here because she likes it here. I'm just frustrated that if I ever bring up happy thoughts or times in Seattle she just talks about the times I wasn't and tries to get me to focus on that instead."
TW: Has a family member/some one close to you told you your depression makes them walk on egg shells around you?,2,ml988z,2,"TRIGGER WARNING AHEAD:

Ijust got into a huge fight with my sister over something small and she revealed that he finally had enough of my depression and her walking on eggshells around me. I barely talk to her because she’s always stressed 

from work, and I never share my depression problems with her because she once blamed me for making our mom cry over attempted suicide (yes, she said that to me weeks after my recovery in the hospital) 

I honestly feel so hurt how my own sister could say those things about me, especially coming from my own blood.

I just need some sort of validation or comfort here I guess because my family seems to outcast me more that I’m living with depression and it’s honestly triggering me to hurt myself again because I feel more useless and burdensome to them."
Finally getting around to creating a living will and it's eating me,1,mldkuv,0,"I don't know if this is the right place for this, so my apologies if it isn't, but I've finally decided to sit down and address my living will and I've realized that there isn't a single person in my life I feel safe or happy leaving guardianship of my young daughter to, and it's very disheartening, but more so it's eyeopening and it's now sitting on me like a ten ton brick. 

With COVID, being fairly isolated working from home, not being in physical contact with people I used to see daily, the loss of a relationship last year that really had me scrambling to stay functioning, and the sad realization that maybe this is all life has to offer is really making me feel like I'm experiencing some sort of depression. Not really outwardly, but within myself for sure. I've done the family doc thing, done the lab work to see if there's something there, exercised my butt off, lots of fresh air and sunshine, no luck.

I'm pretty successful, career-wise. I own a house and a car and all the toys I could want. I don't worry about money. I have quite a few friends and a lot of family who also don't really need to worry about money. These are reasons I question whether or not my post is appropriate for this sub, as I realize there are so many people out there less fortunate than I.

But I don't have a single person I want to list as my daughter's guardian in the even of both her mom (my ex, but friends) and I were to pass away. I have lots of friends with children, none of whom have parenting styles or family situations I would want my daughter to be saddled with. My sisters are in the same boat. Awesome people, love their kids to death, but not what I want my child living in or being raised in. The single person I'm close enough to that would undertake this responsibility is my own dad, and I'm hoping the situation never arises where I predecease my own parents. I had a pretty bad health situation ten years ago, which I've fully recovered from (as far as I, or any of my doctors know) and outside of that I'm healthy as I've ever been.

This is like peeling an onion, I think. The more I examine this, the more I feel like maybe I'm not where I wanted to be. Shouldn't I be surrounded with family and friends that are more like me? I don't feel my expectations are too high, as I know plenty of people who parent like I do and would do nearly as good a job at raising my daughter, but I'm not ""close"" enough with those people. Why are the ones I'm closest to so far from what I expect here? Why am I suddenly overcome with this internal panic over my own mortality and what I'd be leaving behind? How many people would even attend my funeral, let alone step in for my child? 

How do the rest of you deal with this hypothetical but certainly possible scenario? Should I be trying to redesign my life so that there are more people like this in it? Am I being unfair and demanding or judgemental? Any heartfelt, constructive advice would be appreciated.

End of first world problems rant."
Hello,3,ml7b3h,1,"I know my problems aren’t half as tough as the ones that are posted in here, so i don’t want to look like an asshole talking about my “problems” so basically im asking to tell someone about it i stoped talking to my therapist cuz of my choice cuz it was too expensive, so if anyone here is available pls let me know"
How do I support a depressed friend without them feeling guilty or obligated to respond?,1,mlde4j,3,"So I strongly suspect one of my friends is depressed. We have kind of talked about it but he is never really that open about it. I love him to pieces and miss talking to him but don’t want him to feel guilty for not talking to me in return. 

I have anxiety and have also gone through some periods of depression in life. In response, I pushed away people. I wouldn’t respond and then I’d feel guilty for not responding to the point I never reinitiated conversation. I don’t want him to feel like I did but I want to give him support.

I heard that sometimes just having a reminder that you’re loved and have someone who will support you is important. I want to give that to him but don’t want him to feel obligated to respond, nor do I want him to feel guilty for not responding. I love him, that’s not going to change. 

How do I approach this?"

A week ago I spent a week staying up late mentaly supporting a friend online to stop gim from killing himself only to find out he was goating me. Meanwhile over the past year or so my foster brither has shown a huge lack of motivation to go to school, work, or reqly anything, my mom has been lieing to my dad about this to keep him from kicking him out the house. Keeping a bug strain on her maridge. I cant keep up doing this shit I need fucking help"
Hospitalized for reasons other than mental health,3,ml77kv,7,"But they won’t give me my mental health medications. Which is one reason why I’m awake at nearly 4am. I had a nightmare because I didn’t get my prazosin. 

Also when I asked for juice last night they took away my water and said I am NPO until the doctor decides if I need more tests.

I’m diabetic. My blood sugar was 89 after dinner. So the second reason I’m awake is I’m hungry, have a bad hunger headache and keep having hypoglycemic feels (idk what to call them but I get this weird sensation down all my limbs when I’m hypo). I said I felt hypo and she said I can’t have any food. 

They just think I’m a fatass who can’t control their food intake. But I manage my blood sugar well. I might be fat but I take care of my blood sugar and my a1c is 6.0. 

Every time I put my phone down I notice my head hurts and how hungry I am and I get depressed. I miss my son. I was supposed to do Easter with him today."
Got My Meds!,10,ml1pbk,1,"Good news! After a long, difficult time I have been able to convince my parents to buy me anti-depression meds! I am super excited, I realize that it is a small dose, but I am hope this will be the “kick in the butt” I need to start making some improvements. This combined with talk therapy will make a difference. I pick them up in a few days. I’ll update you guys in a couple of weeks about how it’s going, but until then thank you for all the kind words on this sub."
I just. Don't even feel real,4,ml5wpa,2,"That's it. I keep looking at myself in the mirror and thinking ""Who are you?""

I can't do it anymore because I am in this state constantly and it's all I can think about.

I can't do normal things, because ""Oh, you can't do that. You're not normal and you don't deserve too. You're not talented enough. You're not smart enough. You will never get to experience life. Or you will, but it will be hard, and you'll deserve every second of it.""

Trying to make friends, ""Don't bother even trying. You're a monster inside and out, a terrible person who wants nothing more than to hurt these people. They deserve better.""

I try to push myself to do things, and I've done a lot already, but still this feeling persists. Does it ever go away? Will I just keep pushing myself until I die? Only time will tell, I guess.

But I'm realizing too, every activity I do, it's not because I WANT to do it, it's because I'm trying to distract myself from my head. 

Playing a video game? I'm just trying to silence the negativity in my head and focus on something else.

GOing for a walk? Trying to escape these feelings of loneliness, isolation, and paranoia. 

Watching a movie? Trying to escape my life.

I have no dreams anymore. It's like they've been crushed by reality. I have no interests, everything is just me trying to stop feeling this way. "
The sad thing about being depressed.,3,ml75ae,0,"You’re just told to suck it up, move on and continue.

Nobody cares that you’re in such a volatile state. Nobody cares that you haven’t eaten in a week. Nobody cares that you’re unable to get up out of bed.

Often told to reach out to people, friends, family or even a therapist but why bother when they’re not concerned? You head into work and everybody there doesn’t care at the slightest whether you’re suffering mentally. You head to school, college, university and everybody assumes you’re egotistical and big headed for not socialising. You surround yourself with a crowd of people, but you still feel so lonely. Your personal desires, interests, hobbies and passions aren’t motivating. You lose touch with who you truly are but others claim that you’re being somebody you’re not - trying to force a fake perception of yourself.

Oblivious of your state until the scars appear on your body. 

Mental health is real. Just because you can’t see it, doesn’t mean that it doesn’t exist."
How do you feel from this feeling?,6,ml4uhl,0,"Dear Community,

First off, thank you all for providing a space to talk. I’ve found during this pandemic Reddit has been a huge help in feeling more connected.

I’m seeking advice into how to move beyond my current situation which makes me feel like I’ve really hurt myself and those around me.

I was studying last year in the Netherlands and things went sideways with my studies for a plethora of reasons. I was forced to move back home to Canada with my parents as I got myself into another school in London, UK.

Most of my friends have moved away by now, but I still have a few friends I see. I spend most of my time studying alone preparing myself not to fuck up my school situation again when I begin in Sept 2021. I've constantly been feeling I'm such a failure, and that I've wasted so much time and haven't progressed it sufficiently.

When I see my friends and family, I feel like I'm always hiding that I feel so defeated even though my next school is excellent and it should be a great new chapter ahead. I've always felt my family doesn't support my goals so I don't open up to them.

I just want to feel better. I want to feel like I've healed my depression. I want to feel like my past fuck ups will lead to something worth while. I want to feel that I am a good friend. I want to restore my faith in myself. I feel it's dwindling.

Does someone have some ideas as to how I can confidently restore my inner strength?

Feeling so lost."
I don't feel like myself.,3,ml72r7,1,Every day I feel like just something existing. I feel like my presence is not necessary. I don't know who I am anymore. I do stuff but find no satisfaction. I look at my hands and question my existence. I just want to go back in time and feel normal again. I am afraid of the future. I believe that there is no future for me anyways. I don't want to live the future. I just stopped caring.
I've built such an empty life,3,ml721a,1,"I could literally get hit by a car or something tomorrow and I'm so seperated from people and friends that if they go months without hearing from me, they'll probably just think i'm in a self isolating mood. It's such a gross mood."
I probably have depression,6,ml2wyi,1,"So incase this wasnt obvious by my username being a bunch of letters this is a throwaway account, i don't want anyone knowing this is me. So basically yeah I might and probably do have depression, I'm not exactly sure where to start and theres a good chance i delete this. I guess I'll start with last night when I was having trouble sleeping, so I take naps pretty much every day and that causes me to have a hard time sleeping when night actually comes, so I was looking into that and I saw that that's a symptom of depression, something that's probably not good is when I was reading the bad effects of a poor sleep schedule I misread one of the effects as death and actually got excited for a second, so yeah I take 2 depression tests and both say I have very severe depression, to be honest I contemplate self oof (idk if theres a filter for the word but I dont want to check) multiple times a day, I will never really do it because I dont want to make my friends and family sad or anything, I dont know why I'm even writing this tbh, just wanted to get it off my chest, I dont want to tell my family cuz they'll probably get mad at me or freak out, theres more to this story but I'm not sure if I really want to share it all"
Is there a support group that holds regular discussion or something?,1,mlcvjn,1,"This pandemic has taken a serious toll on my mental health. I find myself dealing with difficult feelings every waking hour. I don't have a single friend in real life to talk to.  I have no one to look up to. While I do have online friends, my interaction with them is very rare.

I was wondering if there was some kind of a serious support group (free of cost of course) that holds regular ""round table"" sessions where people talk about and listen to how/what each other feels. I have seen something like this only in movies and tv shows. Maybe there is one in real life that is online and open for anyone in the world?

It's been about a week...,3,ml6y26,3,"I haven't thought about her in about a week. I haven't had an episode in about a week. I haven't broken down in about a damn week.

Everything we had, everything we built. Just gone. She's happy being with someone else and I'm laying here alone and crying. She threw me to the curb almost literally. She treated me like shit. Why the fuck do I miss her so much if she was so fucking mean to me... it shouldn't hurt this bad. I should be happy. But I'm not. Even though she wounded me, it hurts more to not be with her. I got so used to having her that I feel so lost and empty without her. I feel so alone. And angry. Angry that someone I loved so fucking much would replace me so fucking easily. Literally the day after I left her new boyfriend moved in... sleeping with her in the same bed we slept in... it should be me but I let everything fall apart... I tried to hold on... but I failed. And now she's happy as she can be with the one she belongs to. And I'm crying myself to sleep for the first time in a week...."

This is more about the doctors I've been telling them for 5 years about my period problems and it's like they never took me seriously I've never had a consistent period. 
I told my mother and friends its going to be pcos and everyone was acting like im being horrible and it wouldn't like huh.
Ofcourse today the doctor came and confirmed that i have polycystic ovary syndrome

"My (25 M) gf (26 F) wants to die, I don't know what to do.",3,ml5mim,0,"Hi fellow redditors,  


There is a lot going on, but I will try to be as objective as I can while giving context. I'll try to ask as many questions as I can to clarify things if necessary as I will likely forget something, but me and mostly my gf need help. TL:DR at the bottom. (hopefully will be ""tldr sized"")

My (25 M) GF (26) is dealing with depression since she was a teenager but got drastically worse when she lost someone really close in her family. Since then she's been in a number of therapists and psychiatrists without success, and is losing hope. Before knowing her I really didn't know anything about depression and I am really ashamed of myself for still not understanding it. We've been together for 3 years now and things were okay I guess, with ups and downs until last year. She has been fighting against a combination of depression, occasional anxiety and panic episodes, binge eating, fibromyalgia and issues with her body image (which I contributed to that). I've been living with her and her family for about 6 months now and it's being rough, to say the least.

About the last issue, last year right before pandemic hit, she had a pretty heavy (for me) surgery involving a liposculpture and breast implant saying (her words) it would be helpful against her depresison. I was against that since she was not physically okay to begin with (coughin heavily) and she was beautiful the way she was, but she insisted. Things went downhill since then, she almost died from anemia days after surgery, still coughing her lungs out, started complaining about burning on her back, and when the pandemic hit, all post-op was halted. With the scars and swelling her self-steem lowered and every movement caused some sort of pain (doctors said to just have rest), which worsen things even more.

With the pandemic, she cound't go to the surgeon/doctor and she started to really dislike the outcome of her procedures, and despite her coughing ceased, her general pain worsened, she didn't move much or doing exercises and naturally gained weight, which may have caused her breast implant to go weird (idk what her mother told me or how plastic surgery works). She was under so many medications that she hit a point of hallucinating and living another life in her head. In the meantime she also tried to overdose herself with a bunch of pills, but hopefully I could warn her mother in time to get her to a hospital. 

Lately though, she was apparently better (than she was after all above) then suddenly started to break down, bringing up everything that made and makes her sad, from her childhood traumas to me now and everyday is just pain for her, saying frequently that she doesn't want to live anymore. I can't even imagine how much pain she is enduring since last year and I am at a loss. She loves me and I absolutely love her, it is soul crushing to see her in the current state and I feel like shit for I could have been the person who helped her instead of making things worse. I am so much grateful for having her in my life, I don't want to give up on her. I have a feeling that she will give up if I do so, but it is not what is making me being with her.

Today she didn't want to take any prescribed medication but some Stilnox and muscular relaxant. Been half asleep all day, barely speaking or mumbling when waking up from nightmares, only wanting to eat cereal and milk (which she never did since we were together) complaining like a spoiled child, rarely eating healthy things. She barely gets up from the bed.  
I read about BII or Breast Implant Illness recently, and many of the related physical symptoms match with hers, but idk what to do since there is no hospital available in case of happening any sort of complication after removing the implants, like happened before when she put them on. And also her surgeon said it can't be officially ""diagnosed"", so it might or might not be it. It's just too much of a coincidence for me.

About my contribution to her depression, I was struggling with porn and masturbation addiction before even knowing her, and since she has issues with herself about how she looks, I never told her about it. Even when she found some material, which was more than once, I couldn't tell her and from then on she doesn't trust me and her self-image issues became even worse. For her, it was like I cheated on her and I don't disagree, I should never had done that in the first place. I'm ""clean"" for almost a year now, but she obviously doesn't believe it.

I'm really frustrated about my uselessness and everything. No health professional seems to care, pingpong-ing her to another speciality, I can't ""express"" my frustration in any form or else it could make things worse than they are now, and can't even think about college anymore (yea, I'm still at it) or even hug her because of her pain. I just want things to get better, I know I am still far from being the best person for her, but I'm willing to do anything, anything to help her.  
I'm sorry for this messy wall of text, it's just how I am now. Any words I'm sure will be helpful. Thanks in advance.  


TL:DR; GF has severe depression and I made things worse. She had plastic surgery last year and since then is only pain, had one suicide atempt and now doesn't want to live anymore due to the physical pain and bad post-op (mostly due to covid). Now she barely gets outside bed, tired of enduring her pain, not wanting to go to therapy, taking medicine or even live anymore. Maybe her implants are making her ill (BII), but there is no way to diagnose and every hospital is full of covid in case there is any issue after removal. How can I help her?"

How to remission?,2,ml8bet,0," TLDR at the end

I'm depressed, have been for a long time. I was verbally abused as a child, and forced to work since i was very young. My family used me to vent their frustrations. I wasn't allowed to go out as a teenager, and on the rare occasion i had to call my parents every hour. 

I was kicked out at 18 but it was okay. My friend taught me how to get a job, a bank account, a cellphone, how to enrol to college. Without her i wouldn't be here. 

I realized something was wrong with me early on, but i didn't know what. It wasn't until my panic attacks became daily that i decided to get medical and psychological help. (thank u healthcare) 

I have been on treatment for around 4 months. 
Its hard. I have opened pandora's box and i cant close it, everything just keeps pouring out. 
Before medication the problem was the anxiety, the low self esteem, the inability to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 
During treatment, now i have to deal with the pressure of ""working on it"", of pushing forward to get better. But if i was able to push forward, then i wouldn't have depression, right? 

Medications don't work... prozac makes me so anxious and violent... i started cutting. 
New medication makes me tired and numb.. i still want to cut.... i cant sleep without pills... i have nightmares either way. I can't eat because im worried i'll gain weight... my head hurts. I have moods wings and i'm isolating from everyone. 

My psychologist told me to concentrate on doing things that make me proud of myself, so i'm trying. Today i went outside for the first time in two weeks. I tried to cycle but my legs are so weak from being in bed all day that i was wheezing after 15 minutes. 
Im still proud though. 

How did i manage to go out? 
i'll tell you in hopes it helps you too.

I was there lying in bed. The blinds were closed and the room was dark. It was 4:30 pm. I had been scrolling social media for a long time and i was getting bored of it. I feel like a waste of time. Then it started hitting me as always: ""you have to do *something* "". Im afraid of doing things, of responsibilities. 

I tried to coax myself into it: ""do something to make you happy and proud"". But it's so hard to get out of bed. I wiggled my legs: limbs still working: check. I wiggled my arms too then my head. I did the worm in bed and using that wormy energy, i sat up. WOW! next step: dont think. keep your mind as blank as possible, like when you meditate. then.. GET UP!! 

if you cant blank the mind (happens to me often) then i just think.. ""I FEEL LIKE ABSOLUTE SHIT. I FEEL LIKE A FUCKING HOT GARBAGE LIQUID AND IM LAYING IN BED LIKE A BEACHED WHALE. SO I MIGHT AS WELL FEEL LIKE THIS STANDING UP CAUSE IM TIRED OF BEING SO FUCKING USELESS FUCK YOU FOR MAKING ME SO USELESS SHIT DEPRESSION. 
And i use that anger to get up. Afterwards i do things that give me a self esteem boost: Dressing in something cool, listening to my favorite playlist... and i keep with the motions until im outside. 

((thank also the meds i take that give my legs a very tingly feeling that doesn't go away unless i move)) 

And thats it thats how i took a shower... and did 15 minutes of cycling... and ate a sandwich. 

(((note tho that it was on the easier side since i like dressing up and being outside, its just hard to actually do it. This is not something ive been able to apply to... washing dishes :((( 

Today i did something that made me proud and happy. I might be depressed but i try to get better.  But i don't know if ill manage tomorrow.. im getting tired of these long days of doing mundane things like im in the olympics...

TLDR: To get out of bed and start your day do the worm until you feel stupid enough to get up.
Try to do things that make you happy as a daily routine before you try to do things that worry you. 
Meditate (basically to empty your mind and see the negative/positive thoughts pass by and just be like ""huh ok"" but give them no importance."
I miss caring about my appearance and materialistic things,1,mlc5dt,2,"I miss caring about skincare and clothes, I just don’t care anymore but still hate feeling ‘ugly’. Kind of accepted it now though"
Everything makes me desperately hysterical,2,ml88rp,0,"TW;
I have battled with depression since I was about 15. I’m 21 now and it’s the worst I’ve ever been. I have been on and off medication with small bouts of low mood being my biggest concern, but over the past 12 months it has escalated. 

During the COVID lockdown (past tense as I live in Australia) I increased my sertraline dose to 100mg, but after finding it was making me extremely erratic and (whilst not having consistent low mood) I was finding myself fighting with my partner and having these explosive violent meltdowns all the time. I decided to start decreasing my dose and I sit on 50mg now. It’s horrible. I find myself constantly in harrowing sobs over simple things and having suicidal ideation. (I don’t wish to die but I wish to severely harm myself to have an excuse to be fast tracked into care and have all my responsibilities be taken away.)

I have an irrational fear (?) of lonely people. Not myself necessarily but the thought that other people, even randoms can be lonely and I guess, loser-ish? Anyway I’ve been sensitive about that since I can remember but now it’s debilitating. I can’t go 5 minutes without welling up in tears about the thought of someone eating alone or a child playing by themselves. I am also finding myself melting down over the innocence of cute objects. I have anxiety about the stuffed animal (yes I have a few stuffed animals still) falling on the floor or god forbid an object that has the resemblance of a face, or something really childlike and naive about its appearance, about it being one on its own. Again I’m finding this anxiety debilitating. 

I feel so angry all the time and it’s like I have randomly decided to resent and hate my older brother. He has severe bipolar, ocd, adhd, and ptsd (we are both child sex abuse survivors, which probably explains a lot to do with this whole innocence upset thing). I have never hated my brother I have always loved him like my best friend but recently I just resent him so much. I don’t have any reason to though. 

I can’t figure out how to make these irrational weird feelings of desperate sadness over stupid things go away. I have booked myself into a dbt clinic and tried finding a new psychiatrist but the wait time for those things is about 3 months and I need help NOW. What do I do."
"Working with depression, the never ending sickness.",4,ml3yq2,3,"Having to go to work everyday while depressed is like having to work while “feeling under the weather” but everyday. The feeling of not physically being able to give it your all. You think to yourself “I’ll just call out for today and I’ll be at 100% tomorrow” but you know that there is no point because tomorrow will just be more of the same. And it only gets worse the more you think about it because there is nothing you can really do to make it go away, it’s not physical, it’s not rational, it’s your own thoughts against you. That fact alone just continues to make it worse. Knowing that your helpless to it."
Swept under the rug..,32,mks3y3,3,"I like how people say they are concerned about your, but make no effort to contact you or even take the time to see you in person. This is what I have to deal with right now. I am in my forties and have been depressed and suicidal for most my life. So I think that people that say they are concerned, are just saying that to make themselves feel better, without making any kind of effort whatsoever to actually be helpful. I have so called friends that seem to have forgotten my phone number or where I live. Neither has changed in years. As most of you that read this sub, are aware of how hard it is to function as a normal human being, dealing with depression, anxiety, etc. No one really understands what we deal with."

I'm currently on Celexa, Wellbutrin, and Mirtazapine, and have been on 6 other meds.I'vw been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder, plus some phobias. 

I've had anxiety behaviors since I was two. I cringe to think about how I acted as a kid because I was so... Well, I just had too much energy in proportion to the situation. I always said the first things that came to my head. 

And in middle school and the first year of high school, I made all this... Drama. Like, I just had ALL this energy to put towards stuff... But I put too much energy towards specific things. 

I don't know where it went. 

I've always been paranoid, always had OCD characteristics (such as excessive hand washing). I feel like on some degree I manipulate people to get what I want. I don't think things through. My mind is ALWAYS racing. It's always going so fast and it's fucking exhausting. I have these ups and downs but they're over the course of a day, not a month. I might wake up absolutely giddy and excited and end the day a sobbing mess, or worse, completely numb. 

I just feel like I'm not going to get better. I'm doing the work. I'm trying my fucking best and giving all that I can and I don't have anything left to give. I feel like something is fundamentally wrong with me for all this shit to STILL not be working. Or maybe a diagnosis is missing. I don't know. I'm so tired..."

Brain fog on SSRI?,2,ml7mej,3,"Hey all,

I've just started taking Fluoxetine (Prozac?) 20mg for the last two weeks - this is my first time taking someone to help with my anxiety and low moods so I don't have much experience in this.. 

I've noticed the last few days I've had severe brain fog where I'm struggling to communicate or feeling disconnected / disassociated from situations - I'm having trouble recollecting things or engaging in a conversation. Although they do seem to be helping to improve my mood. 

I know Fluoxetine takes around 6 weeks to truly kick in, but I'm not sure if this is just a temporary side effect whilst I adjust or if this is a sign that this isn't working for me as it should? 

Does anyone have any experience with this that could shed some light?

This is because shes been struggling recently, both in college and life in general, and these daily tasks and schoolwork don't seem worth it as she's not enjoying life. She also said how she know she's not doing her best at life but also doesn't want to try harder.

What happens when you hardly physically socialize with people for more than year?,1,mlabxj,0,"Hello guys. I don't mean to pester anyone. But I really wanted to know what happens to you physically and mentally if you hardly socialize for more than a year.

Back story: I have been fucked mentally for more than year now. I got diagnosed with dysthemia and bipolar. In between it got a little better last year but then lately for the past few months, it's been very hard to deal with the depression. It's literally putting me on the edge and I feel suicidal almost everyday. Although I know I will never act on the suicidal fantasies. It has made me more reserved and asocial. I have hardly socialised for around a year and few months. I know I should, but I just find it in me. I just wanted to be sure that it won't be having any long-term health effects."
I wish I could be a functional adult.,6,ml1g3q,2,"Title is kinda self explanatory.

My apartment is filthy and I want it to be clean so desperately, but when I sit down to get started I'm just disgusted by myself. Everyone else around me seems so much more put together, even though I know everyone has their own struggles-- it just feels like I'm the grossest person in the room at any given moment. I muster up enough energy to take good care of my cat, since I don't want her to be unhappy because of me, but every time I want to turn that sort of care towards myself I just can't. It almost feels childish, and I'm ashamed that I can't be a functional adult; that I'm just wasting my life doing what feels like nothing.

I think about when I was a little girl and I was so excited to be an adult, and it fills me with even more shame. That little girl would be so grossed out by the person I am now. Now that I'm older and ""supposed"" to be functional, I'm almost embarrassed thinking about the high hopes I used to have. At this point in my life, I feel like I'll never develop the skills to be a clean, organized, and functional person. 

It just bums me out. Anyone else feel the same?"
Can one day be completely ruined by depression?,4,ml2huu,0,"The answer is yes. Yes it can.
I don't want tomorrow to suck.
But it will...I can feel it.
I want to escape tomorrow. I don't want tomorrow to come. I don't even want to even believe in anything anymore.

....just for one birthday...just for once this entire year...I'd like to feel joy...."
Friend is depressed- How to get them to seek professional help?,3,ml535f,0,"Throwaway for privacy and used gender neutral for added level of my friend's privacy.

I have a an old friend, the type that has 1 or 2 hour calls every few months.    We live hours away via flights and are not real close but still friends (per my friend I am one of their only friends)

This friend called me today and I started talking about the Baylor win tonight knowing full well my friend could care less about sports, because I joke about stuff.     

My friend then got all weird about asking me for financial advice or something but then said it was a bad time to ask something.    I told them to ask me whatever and they fell down a rabbit hole after some prodding about losing friends and that their marriage is very bad.      The friend instead of asking financial question they just kind of mumbled non questions.

Now, I have spoken to multiple friends going through marriage issues including imminent divorce before and I am not good at advice but can be a good sounding board for problems.

    I have also had a friend kill himself 10 years ago. I was one of the 4 last people to see him alive having Saturday drinks and invited him to the bar but he decided to go home and isolate and kill himself 3 days later.  It stuck with me bigtime that I missed ALL the signs that I get worried easily about similar issues in others.

Back to my friend now, they feel alone and depressed.   I asked them in as roundabout way but getting to the point if they were imminently suicidal.   They were clear they are not tonight but they are not sure about the long term(meaning yes some suicidal thoughts).    They are clearly in a bad place.    I recommended a therapist and my friend stated they have gone through 10 in the last few years.

    My personality is one of fight through whatever problems you are having including getting help if needed for that fight.   I am not well equipped for depression conversation of someone that is defeated and suicidal, it is not my strong suit.  

I was clear via call and via text after call that people love my friend as my friend stated that no one cares about them (typical suicidal language from what I understand). 

We will have a call later this week.   My friend needs help but I can't do much.    We have no friend crossover that I could reach out to.

What would you recommend is a good help for depression when therapists are not working.    In other words how do I convey successfully my friend should talk to some type of professional... and what kind and how to find that kind?   

TLDR: Depressed likely suicidal friend, therapists not working.   
How to steer friend to professional on next call?"
I’m tired of questioning if I’m lovable despite my mental illness.,7,mkzhgj,1,"I want to KNOW that I’m loveable. I want to experience what it feels like to know that you’re loved. But I’m still alone. Never dated, and don’t feel safe with most friends - and I’m afraid that it will always be this way."
I hate my life. I just want someone to be there for me.,3,ml515g,0,"I’m only 16 but I feel as if my life is basically over.  I seriously do not see myself living pasted 20 years of age if things continue the way they have been.  I’m severely depressed and anxious all the time.  So days it’s hard to function, and others I am able to just get through the day but with emptiness feeling.  I also but on a fake personality to the world so that nobody sees the real me.  I am too sky and scared to talk to a girl and even ask a girl out.  I’m too scared to tell my friends about my depression and suicidal thoughts.  I’ve given up hope on myself.  I don’t want to lose my friends because they would find that seeing the real me puts to much negative energy on them.  My friends are the only reason I haven’t taken my life already.  Without my friends, I seriously don’t know what I would do.  Traumas from my young childhood scar me to this day and I can’t stop my brain form making me relive my worst moment of my childhood over and over again.  It’s as if my brain creates a movie and I’m forced to watch it, every single fucking night.  And I can’t change a thing.  It’s hurts, watching these old memories, traumas, losing my best friend since preschool.  Also, my parents don’t know how to help me.  They just hire a therapist (I’ve had 3 already and they don’t help at all) and they have even sent me to the hospital before which traumatized me and is the reason I now have trust issues.  My mom always compares me to an asshole and she always guilt trips me into doing her bidding.  She thinks that just because I am her child she can treat me like her slave.  I have no say in decisions.  I just want to be away from her.  I just want someone to be there for me.  I need a hug. I need someone to be there to check in on me.  I need a partner.  Fuck I really need a partner.  I feel so lonely all the time.  Everyday I just try to play video games to just ease my pain but they don’t do the trick anymore.  I can’t sleep anymore.  I’m always looking at my phone constantly to see if I get a notification from a. Friend or just someone so that I can distract myself.  So many times I dream that my parents would just randomly wake up at night, hear me crying myself to sleep, come in, and ask me the words that I’ve always want to hear “Are you ok?”  Man, that all I want to here.  I also constantly check my phone hoping that someone would do the same.  Being lonely is killing me, and although I don’t want my life to be this way, I am to shy and anxious to talk to or even ask out a girl out of fear of rejection.  I’m sorry if this post makes no sense I just had to rant.  I’m sorry for even sharing this.  My problems shouldn’t have to become some else’s ya know.  But if you did read the whole thing, thanks for caring enough to see what’s with me.  Your appreciated :)."
Do i have to wait another 20 years?,3,ml50xx,3,Im a 20 year old male and im pretty ugly. Do i have to wait till i get to my 35-40's to enjoy life like others? I love social life but cant get into becouse i can only think that other people are looking to me or even glancing and thinking about how ugly i am. And i feel like people wont do that to any old people. I really wanna get old just to feel comfortable in public. I have a huge coat that covers most of my body as well. People can only see my legs and my face. And i cant even walk around without it. I dont know how to fix that. I always felt that way. Once i even tried really hard to get fit. I was 75kg but after that i saw nothing changed i stopped working out ass well and now im 115kg. I dont know what to do. I dont even know what to think. I spent the last whole week in my room bcs im shy about myself even in front of my parents...

Do I tell my friends I’m depressed?,1,ml9woi,5,I just feel like I can’t tell them I’m depressed because it just feels taboo ish to talk about. Idk how to explain it. I feel like they kinda  already know based on me talking about myself and my past but i just feel like actually saying it makes it more weird.
Everyday feels the same,2,ml6q1c,1,Everyday feels the same and I cant stand it anymore
My depression is not justified,18,mkt8xz,3,"I'm 18 years old, living alone with my mother since i was 1yo. 
I was supposed to be a ""save your marriage free"" baby, but it didn't work out too well. 

I felt like absolute shit for the past 5 years or so, but i never once told anything to my mom or to any of my family members.
In the past everytime i told something to my mom i ended up regretting it sooner rather than later, thats why i swore to never tell her anything ever again, and im a man of my word. Not like she cares too much anyway.
i was always scared that people whould think that i only do it for attention or to have an excuse for why i'm i such a faliure, thats why i always tried to hide my depression and social anxiety as best as i could 

Now im a complete shut in.
I barley leave my room or talk to anyone.
I spend all of my time sleeping, playing videogames, just laying on my bed staring at the wall or studying sometimes.
I dropped out of high school and went back to a different one, so im not going to have any sort of degree for a few more years.
I was trying to get a job of any sort for a year now, but everywhere i go there is at least a dozen
overqualified people lining up for even the shittiest job possible. 

These last few months where too much.
I couldn't pretend to be OK anymore.
And the first time in my life my mom acknowledged that something is wrong with me.
And after that she reacted the way i expected she whould. 

For the past couple of weeks she's been yelling at me almost every day:
shes so fucking done with me, im a lazy piece of shit all i do is sleep all day, my room is a complete mess.
I can play the ""depressed"" she could be so much more depressed than me but she dosen't have the time to, i just pity myself
and things like that.

And i totally get it. 

Working just so you can feed your son, and when you come home all you see is that he is a  fucking mess.
I feel really bad because of that.
And she maybe can't see it but im grateful for all the things she's done for me.
But she talks like i don't have the privilege to feel sad.
She acts like my feelings are invalid because her life is harder.
She makes my feel like a fucking asshole for being deppressed, like somehow it's an insult towards her 

Today she was talking to my grandma on the phone, and i heard her say that i ""act depressed"" 
i could hear my grandma suggest that ""maybe we should get him a terapist""
After that my mom laughed and told her that i don't need one and went on to talk for an hour about how much of a piece of shit i was.
That hurt pretty bad. I probaply was never going to ask for help from her, but now i know even if i did i wasn't going to get it. 

I think this was the final push over the edge
Im so done with this shit"
Idk I’m just ranting it’s kinda dumb but idk 😐,3,ml4rr5,0,"I feel so useless and depressed, but my life is completely fine. Nothing bad has happened in years. I should be over my stupid trauma by now so why am I still scared of the man that hurt me? Like my depression is so fucking useless now cos my life is amazing now but I still spend every hour of the day hiding in my room??whyy just whhyyyy am I like this ?"
if my problems are all from my living arrangement.....,1,ml9rxu,0,I have to leave right? If staying makes me want to kill myself I have to just go right?
My brain is falling apart,1,ml9rfw,0,I used to be cold headed and could logically think and get an answer which was most of the time correct. I am actually becoming more stupid and hot headed. I cannot think straight for more than a moment. And with each mistake I make I fall apart for the rest of the day. I am depressed for a while now but I didn't feel this way. Now that I am in collage I am literally falling apart under the burden of thought that I am not smart enough anymore.
Just a vent,1,ml9mix,1,"I don’t know what to do with my life. We just went back to physical school and I hate it so much, I have barely 3 friends and I’m not even really close with them. I feel like they are with me just because they have no one else to be with between classes. And I do the same. I’m really socially anxious and I can’t speak confidently even with my friends.
I get anxious in classes and uncomfortable and I can’t concentrate and understand simple tasks, I really feel like my brain isn’t working the same as before.

Besides school, I feel like no one actually cares about me. I used to have a really deep connection with my best friend and I don’t feel that anymore with her, I feel like I burden her and ruin her mood every time I try to vent to her (she said that as well) but I don’t know what to do other than that cause I don’t have anyone else I can talk to. I used to feel like she was always there for me and she always said the right thing and made me feel better. But now it’s not the same and I tried to talk to her about it but not much has changed. 

My mom triggers me all the time by saying things about suicide and depression as if it’s nothing serious, and she knows I’m depressed. 

Also summer is coming and people in my school already wear short sleeves and I’m so terrified of the thought of having to show my scars. Makeup wouldn’t hide all of them and neither bracelets cause the scars are all over my arm and some of them are raised. I don’t know what to do I can’t just wear long sleeves all summer. I live in a very hot country. The weirdest part about it is that I don’t even regret having those scars.

I just feel like I’ve had enough. Even if I’m going to have some good experiences in my future, I don’t believe it will ever be worth it. I really don’t want to keep going to school and study so hard just to be able to have a boring job eventually. I hate everything about how this world works and I’m only here because I don’t want to make anyone sad. I wish I never existed in the first place."
Have you ever felt so sad that you throw up?,2,ml6hka,0,hey at least I'm loosing weight
Someone Being “spiteful” of your depression,2,ml6g7v,2,"Maybe this is just something I’ve seen, but if anyone else feels like please chime in. Some people it seems will be attracted to depressed people so they can feel better about themselves, and then go off and laugh and be happy, almost in spite of that person’s depression.

It’s happened to me a couple times where I’ve talked to someone who almost felt like they were laughing internally at me and then would purposefully act like they were in a good mood after talking to me. Wtf? Maybe I’m too soft hearted but I can’t even fathom doing that to someone who is hurting."
What do you do on the days it's impossible to enjoy anything,1,ml9jqr,3,I feel terrible at least a little all the time but some days or weeks or months it's just impossible to enjoy anything or be happy or even just feel neutral. The worst part is I can always feel it coming before it happens but there's nothing I can do to stop it and I've tried everything I can think of. The normal advice is just do things you enjoy or talk to people and I try that but I just end up feeling worse somehow. I want to enjoy something even a little or just be distracted from this feeling but nothing works and I feel trapped. Do I really just have to wait it out every time? The time I get between these moments is getting thinner and thinner and the time this despair lasts is getting longer and I don't know how much more I can take. I've been successfully distracting myself for years and I'm sure I could a few more but I don't even know what the point is anymore.
Something feels really wrong,1,ml9jah,1,"For the past couple nights I’ve been hysterically crying over the mess I’ve created with my life. I mean my life’s always been a mess but lately it feels so much more intense and is making me so emotional. 

I keep praying but I really don’t know if anyone is listening anymore so that feels really unsettling as someone who refuses to doubt there’s a higher power who can hear me. 

BUT besides that, for two nights in a row I’ve been trying to vent and open up to my best friend and both instances I get ignored. The first time it was an hour. Then tonight it was all night and still no response. I get it, people aren’t always available but it’s really really really strange to me because she’s ALWAYS up at night. At first I think she is mad at me for something but in my text last night I quit literally begged her and told her I really need someone to talk to. I had running thoughts all night and couldn’t sleep because I wondered why she wouldn’t answer. The same thoughts repeated over and over and over. I turned my notifications off so I could try to sleep and not care if she replied because I realized she probably wouldn’t. But it’s really unusual that she didn’t. 

I’ve messaged various people and get no reply. It’s just WEIRD. 

Not a single person is listening. And I’m trying to prepare for work today and then get my school work done after (I’m in college) but I think it’s going to be a mess. I keep being on the verge of tears and I won’t stop thinking about how abandoned I feel. 

To try to sleep last night I really tried to think of things that are positive but all those turned so negative. And it was really hot in my room. It’s just a mess and I’m trying really hard to find a reason for why I feel so wrong."
Can anyone help,2,ml6ds6,1,"I just dont know what to do, I feel trapped and all alone like no one loves me or ever will. My 13th birthday is something that messed with me a lot I'm still 13. So first off my mom and brother got locked up my dad slept the whole time coming down off meth, my aunt overdosed trying to kill her self but ended up shooting her self. No one even got me a card. No one played attention to me either. Also I havent had friends for over a year and at this point I'm just giving up."
Going downhill,4,ml2xuy,1,"I don’t really know where to start with this. It might be a really long read, because I have a tendency to bottle it up and so now everything is just kind of exploding out.

So my life is really good by almost all standards. I have a warm house, parents that love me, and almost everything else. But the stuff you can’t measure is all shit. I can’t socialize well at school and I end up being that quiet kid, and I give off a weird vibe apparently. My romantic life seems to be going down the drain too, and I can’t do a single thing to stop it. I also have a really strong ability to put up a facade, so I seem perfectly normal and happy around everyone else. But on my own, I feel so gray. Nothing seems to make me feel worth the air I breathe, and I’m scared that the next time something bad happens it might be the last straw. I just won’t be able to see any point in holding on longer. 

But that’s just my thoughts on everything. Hopefully nobody else is feeling the same way, and if you are I hope you can find some point in life. Sorry again for the long read"
I'm so unhappy.,2,ml6bty,0,"I hate my life. Im not important to anyone. I'm no ones best friend or girlfriend. I have a tinder which I barely get any action on. I'm still a virgin and have never even been kissed. I'm working a minimum wage job, studying at uni and I feel like im not even understanding or learning anything. I dont like how I look, I hate photos and hate getting dressed up. I feel like every other girl is 10x prettier than me. I don't have many friends and the ones I do have, I feel like it's just going to end anyways. 

I do the same shit everyday. Notbing makes me happy, or fulfills me anymore. Im constantly empty. I'm constantly fighting with myself. Im constantly bored. I feel so empty 24/7 and I'm so tired of it. My life sucks and I don't think it's ever going to change."
What should I do?,3,ml4c0v,1,"I 19F am severely depressed. I've had depression since I was 9 this was because the man who raised me randomly died. We believed the combination of him drinking and him having diabetes caused it. Right after he passed my mother's long time boyfriend who had just gotten out of jail started verbally and mentally abusing me. I'll admit I was chubby, weird, and lazy so I got bullied often on top of this even by him. Despite this I kept trying and eventually after a few years I got better but randomly it all came back one night. I tried taking my life. No one took it seriously and just thought it was a cry for attention. Then when I turned 16 I told my mom about some serious abuse I suffered from by one of her boyfriends when I was 4, she called me a liar. Well I kept pushing and eventually I slimmed down, made friends and even met a amazing man who is my fiance. Eventually it all came back when my mom left randomly to take care of my grandpa and move him back to her farm. She left and missed my 18th birthday and has barely even spent any time with me since then. That same year my brother started huffing air duster cans to the point he crashed a car. We tried constantly to get him to stop but his pregnant wife kept enabling his behavior when he would start to get better. Then the pandemic came and with it I lost almost all my friends well now I don't think they ever were friends. So I've been stuck in my house with my fiance who constantly makes me insecure and gaslights constantly. Things got much worse recently because last month on March 3rd my brother died. Me and my mom rushed when we heard he was unconscious to her farm but by the time we got there he had been dead for hours. He died in her tractor and no one found him until 4 hours after he passed. I've tried to stay strong this time but I just don't know if I can anymore. I want to stay strong for my mom and for everyone but I just feel so alone. No one has even taken a second to ask if I'm ok and I'm not ok. It's getting too much for me. I just want to go to school or just start working but I can't. I can't work until I get my surgery in June and I'm scared I'm going to go through that alone too. I can't start school untill I receive the scholarships I need. I'm just so scared and I just feel alone in this work, I just want to be happy. I don't know what to do anymore."
It's all coming back,1,ml9anm,1,I have to go to school tomorrow and my anxiety and depression are returning. I was in relative peace for 2 weeks but now my anxiety is back I guess
"Been depressed for so long, I don't think I can even recover from it",4,ml2pio,3,"Despite being 26 I see very little reason in wanting to continue to live. I still live with my parent, have a felony that I've had since I was 17, working at a dead end low paying job, no friends, and of course no girlfriend. After my last girlfriend left me in 2017, Ive been doing the same things on repeat; go to work, sleep, and watch tv, nothing matters and my life is a waste of space on this planet. I really believe that I have no place in this world and that I'm destined to fail at everything and that I will die alone. I want to go out and meet people so that maybe I can make some friends and meet a nice lady but lately I've been having intense social anxiety attacks lately and it's only getting worse with each passing day so even that seems like a pipe dream now. I don't think I can ever recover from my depression, and I don't think my life will get any better."
I was raised by a narcissistic parent. [VENTING],1,ml9542,3,"And the other day she came up to me and essentially was asking me why I'm so miserable all the time. And asked THAT question we all never wanna hear. ""why can't you just be happy"". But she doesn't want me to be happy for me. She wants me to be happy so I'll talk to her more. I just love how she makes my issues a problem because of what she wants for herself. I haven't even been able to treat my depression with meds even though I'm 23 bc I'm afraid she'll go into my room and take them and throw them out. And then her excuse would be ""well you're on my insurance so I can do whatever I want"".

Real talk. I was doing better until she came up to me that day. Feeling like a little down and slow and not talkative because works been hard lately. She got mad at me for not talking to her enough. But that's literally what I try to do. I try to avoid contact with her because I know everything she says to me is to try and control me and to get me to do stuff for her when all she is is rude and condescending to me. She tells me my depression isnt real. And that shit just fucking pisses me off. I've been dealing with depression for a long time. Like 10 years but on and off. And ik that seems like a long time but it's because I was on drugs. I'm clean now but it's hard to get better when the people who are supposed to be your support system just make you feel like shit and invalidate your feelings. Ik this post is a bit all over the place I just needed to vent all this stuff lol.

Also just remembered that literally 5 minutes after we had this big pissing match she came up again to show me a letter someone wrote to her at her job praising her. She knew I was upset. I can't ever hold back my tears im a baby lol. But just wanted to talk about herself of course. She has a ridiculously big ego. Which maybe for some is fine. But she's a narcissist.

Last thing I'll talk about which was the hardest thing of our fight. She makes me feel like I'm fucking up. And like I'm irresponsible when I'm not. There was an issue with my car payment and she saw a letter from the car company (WITH MY NAME ON IT) opened my mail and said the letter said there wasn't enough money to complete the transaction. Which was bs because there was. It turned out at be an issue with them having the wrong account shit. But whatever lol. She then went on to tell me how my sister never did shit like this. She always did everything right. Like. Dude.. I'm sober. Working a good job. Doing all the right things! I'm just trying to do stuff for myself rn. As in my mental health. And I feel like I can't with her in my life cause all she ever does is shove my successful sisters life in my face by comparing me to her. And making me constantly feel like my feelings are invalid. And making me feel like everything I'm doing isn't enough.

OK. I have finished my. Venting. If you read this thank you 🖤"
how am I supposed to live in a terrible world like ours?,4,ml45bl,3,"So much pain. So much suffering. So much loss, for so many varied, completely unnecessary reasons. How am I supposed to enjoy a cup of coffee? When I know the suffering “we” have endured. I can’t take myself seriously because I feel the pain, for what very very very little that is worth. How am I supposed to believe that I, me, tiny inconsequential me, is supposed to want to live amongst all of this pain and loss.

weight and appetite loss on sertraline,1,ml924m,1,"ive been on sertraline for about a month now, my dosage is 50mg and i feel like my depression is pretty much cured. however ive been losing tons of weight, i had decreased appetite during my worst depression phase and its still the same. so ive had continuous weight loss for a few months now, in total ive lost about 30lbs. since my doctor put me on sertraline ive lost around 8lbs. food just doesnt taste that good and im completely ok with not eating for an entire day, but i force myself to eat. i just have no desire for food, and i just wanna know if anyone else experienced this? and does it go away? if i stop taking sertraline are there withdrawal symptoms like weight gain?"
"depression and addiction, i feel trapped",2,ml5xvg,2,"hello, i’m a 21 year old female and i’ve recently decided to go into a sober living home which i’ve been in since january, i got a dui & crashed my car & got kicked out of where i was staying so, i kinda had too. i never thought i was and alcoholic/addict until i moved in here. i just always thought i was the crazy party friend, my depression and anxiety is something i’ve always dealt with but always chose to ignore and drink & do drugs instead. until i try too OD after a month long binge, then the dui & now here i am. ive been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and ptsd, i take meds for it all. i’ve been kicked out a few times for breaking sobriety but they just gave me my last chance last week. i have no where else to go, no one to call or fall back on, no family, so this is really my only chance. but it sucks so bad because i’m not ready to be sober, i’m depressed every single day, every day from the moment i wake up i just feel like shit & i just think of dying or running away, all i want to do is use & drink but i can’t because if i do i’ll end up homeless and it’ll just go downhill from there. i hate that i need substances to feel better & that it’s so easy to make me feel like i don’t deserve anything & that i’m worthless. my childhood traumas haunt me & i don’t feel like i have anyone to turn too cause i look dramatic or like i want a pity party cause they just can’t understand. i feel like i’m stuck in this cycle w myself. i know no one else can help me but me, no one else can make that change for me, no one can come & save me & fix me or help me, no one can heal my trauma but me, but i don’t know how too, i feel like i’m drowning & all i want to do is hide in substances & run away, too the point where i want to leave the program just to do it, even if it means being on the streets, i could careless about myself right now. i don’t know how to deal w this, i feel like i’m going to break any moment."

"Lost my (25F) close friends I connected w over quarantine, for being too depressed",2,ml5qve,1,"I don't even know where to write this, but I don't think the average person can relate, so I am posting here. I can't be bothered to make a burner account. Everyone is an adult in this situation, but most are 21~23. This will be only from my POV and condensed to just the parts relating to being depressed.

I recently, only a bit over a week ago, lost an entire close knit group of friends who had set up a virtual ""intervention"" over things I said on my private twitter that I have used for 7 years as a coping mechanism. They accused me of many things including misleading them on purpose to make them worry, and saved screenshots that they sent amongst each other to theorize what it may be about. They all sent in their examples of my venting(some which I deleted and had a timestamp of '4 minutes ago') and attached their thoughts to each one; even the friends who did not have access to this account. Also, I think this is important to add, but I warned each person that it was for my venting and warned them about how it was a lot. I never handed out the account personally, and only accepted a follow request after talking to them first. I tried to give any context and explain how that made me uncomfortable that they'd assume so, but was told I wasn't supposed to talk. I eventually left the conversation and after one girl tried to call me, I texted her saying I needed time to think and process. After I slept on it, most of them blocked me and told me I wasn't worth their time. I've been struggling a lot with thinking they are right.

Has anything similar happened to anyone else? I have no idea what to do at this point since I was already extremely lonely (they already had started leaving me out for around 2 months) and don't know if I should talk to anyone else, as any other friends I haven't talked to much since the pandemic, and ALL are connected in some way to at least one person in this ""friend group"". I feel like if I say anything, whoever I reach out to would share what I said to the group and my words would be twisted again.


I'm trying to hard to battle this while already being at a low point in my depression after experiencing two major deaths only about a month apart late 2020. I try to keep my mind distracted, but I'm often reminded of them, as a lot of my hobbies involved at least one of them in some way. I'm very numb at this point."
"Y'all ever want someone to check on you, but at the same time be left alone?",1745,mk1q38,83,"Idk what it is, but like I want someone to ask me how I'm doing, maybe let me at least vent for a while. I want to be honest and tell people how much I hate myself, feel like a failure, etc you know how it is. 


But at the same time, I don't want any pity. I don't want someone feeling sorry for me and offering empty encouragement because THEY don't like hearing what's really going on in my head. 


I want help, but at the same time I want everyone to shut up and let me be myself."
This is it,3,ml3ftu,1,I’m done with the world any ideas on how to leave it
"Even if it will not fix everything, the lack of girlfriend hurt",17,mksvrt,2,"The first time I was in love was at five, and even as a child being not loved back as killing me inside since that time. I mean even as a child it is not surprising to suffer from that, it is simple, you love her, she don't love you. Ow I know it'll not fix everything etc... But the lack of affection, of having someone you love and love you, of hugs and caresses you give and receive it's really hard on the long term. The only few times(two in fact) I had a gf, it was the best feeling in the world and was the first time I was feeling completely happy and on the long term. Otherwise even at really good moments, like going to holidays with friends, it's cool, but there is always that ""it would be so much be better with girlfriend"", and the times I was with one yes it was so much better. The only thing I am left with is hope from time to time, it is cool the first three weeks, then it's okay but start hurting for a few weeks/months, then I get rejected and bam. I was so hopeful recently with a girl, even with the lockdown I had a lot of hope, I was even suprised that with the lockdown, not doing a lot of things, not seeing a lot of people I was happy and confident as fuck, she rejected me recently and since then... Fuck

And it's the only thing that gave me a real sense to life, even to unrelated things, I am in college and it motivate me to do homeworks, to work, otherwise I wonder ""why that""...

My partner is suicidal and refuses to get professional help.,3,ml3ccd,0,"I don't know what I should do or say to him..
I want them to live..
His idea is that therapy professionals, sorry for the offense, are exploitative and expensive where he lives..
He lives in a very toxic environment and there's no way for him to feel better, I think, except by moving to another country where lgbtq+ are accepted.. 
He immerses himself in work and he's a top achiever in his company but that's only to get through suicidal thoughts without actually killing himself. He feels suicidal and hopeless. He feels miserable talking about his feelings.. 
I need to know how to make him feel better for the time being and if it's possible to convince him of visiting a therapist.."
Can depression cause memory loss?,8,mky3yc,4,My memory is so bad these days that I can't remember most of my childhood and my adolescence. Only fragments of it. I'll rarely get a flashback and it's usually a bad memory. Now I'm forgetting where I place things. I'm finding that I'm misplacing things more often than normal. Can depression destroy my memory or something?
hate myself,2,ml4xw8,1,i hate that i’m so sensitive and take everything so personally. i hate that i’m so insecure and that it’s probably super obvious. i convinced myself that my bf finds me super annoying and just idk. i just think such horrible things of myself and i never tell him about it- frankly anyone. so in turn i start to tell myself he must think the same. i’ve been depressed for years now and it’s just so hard. i’m so tired rn i just want to cry but i can’t. i feel so numb.
How do I be more supportive of my boyfriend?,6,mkwpnl,2,"So I don’t know if this is the right rubreddit to post on but my boyfriend has been diagnosed with depression before and he can be really moody and get really irritable over things and I know I’m not a therapist and there isn’t very much I can do and I can’t really physically see him very often, but if there are any other girlfriends that might know how to help or what to do when they’re feeling bad and need a little “pick me up” maybe but any kind of little things that could maybe help."
i feel like im running out of time,23,mkoxdb,4,"im turning 21 soon and im still living with my parents jobless and friendless in college. i thought that by now things would be better for me. it is so disappointing to see myself look and act this way because throughout my childhood, people have expected great things from me. i avoid my old friends because i feel so horrible about myself and i really dont think i can face them. i only use social media for important matters but it still fucking hurts to see my peers grow into themselves. im turning 21 without an identity, no longer interested in my old hobbies,  with a heart as hard as a rock. i wish i could get treatment because im tired of living this way."
I‘m getting scared of myself.,5,mkzlrl,10,"I seriously don't know what to do, don't know who to talk to. I just want to get this out somehow, sorry for throwing this on ya'll. I just feel lonely. let down. forgotten, replaceable. I just feel like it wouldn't matter to anyone if I'd be there or just simply leave.
I don't feel love, gotten completely unresponsive.. Forgot how to feel affection or how to respond if someone is showing some...
I've gotten completely numb. I feel like a sidecharacter in my own life. Like the person you'd see once and forget about just moments after he left the screen. A face without significance. A character you could just throw away if you feel like doing so, like if he never existed... Its just depressing... I feel like I'm missing out on life. Missing out on society, like if I'm not a part of it... I just feel like crying.
I don't have suicidal thoughts. yet. Haven't harmed myself. yet. But I'm seriously getting scared of myself. I just recently caught myself holding a knife and playing ""what if I'd do this"" mindgames with myself... I'm getting scared of myself, scared that I might lose control over myself and end up hurting myself or even others.
I often think about these things... Everytime I start to feel sick. my hands are starting to shake and I get cold and my legs get weak. sometimes even so weak that I couldn't stand proper anymore... I dont know what to do...."
I’ve been stagnant for 3 years and I don’t know what to do anymore,59,mkij4m,12,"I wake up every morning with dread and spend the day stuck in my head. I haven’t worked and when I do I barely manage to scrape by before leaving or let go. Everyone else has progressed since graduation and I can’t seem to get out of my head. I had expectations for the last years of my youth and they were all spent miserably, unfulfilled, eventless, and scared. I feel so alone and scared all the time. I think this is more anxiety than depression. Please send some words I just want to live again and I’m running out of time."
Does it ever get so hard that you resent anyone who doesn’t suffer from depression?,3,ml2ktz,1,I’m so envious of anyone who doesn’t have it. Anyone who seems like they don’t have to give 110% just to get out of bed.
Just a note.,5,mkzgcj,2,"Maybe writing this will help me. But it probably won't. I've always wanted to write a suicide note. 

I cry myself to sleep now. I want to every night. Because no matter how hard I try, I'm still me at the end of the day. I'm everything I hate. I'm selfish and ugly. I'm hateful, and depressing, and petty. I'm a trauma survivor, but I don't feel like I survived. I feel like my heart's been slowly shredded with a machete. Every possible friendship I could have I ruin, because I'm trash. Everyone was right to call me trash. Because that's what I am. 

I don't want to hurt anyone but I feel like I'm drowning in sorrow. I'm so lonely. God I'm so lonely. 

The only way I feel like I can be free is if I die. Nothing is fixing this. I hate getting up in the morning. I hate seeing myself in the mirror. I'm in agony. I'm so utterly alone on this planet. I feel like a monster. 

I'm sorry I even ever existed. I'm sorry for it all. I'm sorry."
The world doesn't need me anymore.,2,ml4nop,2,"Sometimes I do not know what's wrong with me... Whenever I join or start a conversation, no one is ever going to respond to me. Whenever I ask my friends questions or meanings about what they have said, it seems like they never allow me to join their chats. Whenever others go out and have fun, not only am I not invited, but nobody is willing to tell me where they are going. I always have been jealous of others' ability to join in any group of friends without encountering any repulsion.

I have always tried my best to answer and address other's issues whenever they have difficulties, usually about academics... I am very willing to help. However that doesn't pay off. I start realizing everyone is just making use of me without really treating me as a friend.

What should I do? I feel really upset everyday and I think the world is just leaving me alone."
"I dont know, I need help",1,ml7puc,0,"So for a really long time now I have been feeling... upset isnt quite the right word, maybe numb? I will preface this by saying in my mind I have lots of reasons to be happy, I can wear a smile like a pro, I dont really have hardships in my life but yet this numbness/sadness hangs onto me. I feel like I am just mental as I can not find any motivation to even fix my own problems, I am 27 and still live with my parents and that feels like I am a massive failure, I like my job but I feel like I am stuck, I applied for a teaching training course, paid for it and have only done one thing with it, I just stare at it and cant bring myself to head towards happiness. A thing that gets me down and I feel like I have no power over is my relationships, I have a couple close friends who I love dearly but I have only had 2 girlfriends, both lasted three years and I dunno, I guess I feel so much happier in a relationship but I dont wanna rush into something and I dont do well with expressing my emotions much either, even this is hard. I would love some advice, or even just someone to be able to spot something in me as I never thought I would be in this position, I wouldnt say that I have depression but god knows maybe that is what this is. I just want help and a way to stop this self destructive part to finally be able to feel happy again because honestly cowardice is the thing that is keeping me going these days"
Opening up irl,9,mkx731,1,"I’m thankful to have this subreddit to use as an outlet when I’m at my worst, however, I believe I should open up to friends and family as a step towards improvement. I think some of my close friends would be receptive to hearing my story and potentially provide help for me. I would like to open up to them first, as my family contributes to a lot of my emotional trauma and the situation might get ugly. The problem is that I’m emotionally dumb and I wouldn’t know how to begin such a conversation. My aim isn’t to make things too emotional or awkward, but they should be informed about how dark things have gotten in my past so I know I have people to turn to when I’m feeling down again. It’s difficult because I’ve never had an emotionally supportive friend, and while I’ve tried online therapy, I’d imagine it would be a more candid experience. If anyone has ever experienced anxiety about communicating your depression with others, I’d appreciate your advice."
I’m seeing a psychologist,3,ml2fp6,1,"I’ve finally tried getting help after a while of struggling and various um failed attempts, I was wondering if I should tell them everything? Like in regards to self harm too? I don’t want to be sent to a facility, but I do want help. I’m turning 17 so I feel like if I say I do self harm they’ll talk to my dad and it’ll be a complete mess, any thoughts?"
I feel like I can't really do things until I get meds.,2,ml4bsr,0,"I have a few months of college left. I find myself being really isolated every day and idk how healthy that is. I do my best to attend online class, do my tasks for work, I am in therapy. But I'm always avoiding and isolating since it is much too painful to see or be around others too long. 

My depression is also getting bad and I start to think I can't really 'do things' until I get meds. Sure I can do things, I just can't do them well, I can only get through them. I've been working out again and it's something I look forward to since it's something I can just do. Each rep, etc. 

I small talk when I can, but really there's a lot of emotional baggage with me. I think it might scare people if they see how alone I am. How I sit in isolation, sometimes just lost, anxious, scared. If I hear noise of people I would move somewhere to try to not be seen. The clothes I have are also kind of old, some from high school since I never got new stuff, but I have to buy things special for my size but then I don't want to spend the money since I'm scared if it's wrong then I pay for returns, etc. So when I choose things to not look like a piece of shit or keep wearing the same thing. 

Honestly I just need a lucky break. I can keep on 'doing things' but I can't produce real work. I can only get through, like each rep of a dumbbell. It's a problem since I need to do real work if I want to not fail out, and to keep being employed. To slowly stop the isolation that really was with me my whole life. To spend money on myself. To clarify at least some of my plan for the future. I'm still drifting, even things like planning a meal in are hard (including eating it) but I can get through things and to stop comparing with all the others whose lives are filled with people, and high achievement. To not be bitter about what could have been. To not feel like I'm missing chances."
If you need someone to talk to..,1,ml7fe0,2,"I am currently going through anxiety and depression I have never felt before last year. I feel the greatest support is through eachother. If you need to talk to someone, feel free."
What are you supposed to do if you're crippled by depression and need to lose weight?,6,ml06jn,6,I'm overweight and can't bring myself to even work out for even 5 minutes.
My mom plays the victim when I try to ask for help with my depression.,19,mkp5h3,6,"There’s not a lot to say. I’ve brought it up 2 times with her. Both times she has started calling herself such a bad mother for not noticing, but it never lead any further than us talking about it for a bit and then leaving it at that. The common thing about both talks was that she would start saying what a bad mother she is, how badly she’s raised her children and overall just sounding like the victim in the whole situation. I just want to get some help, but I don’t know how to ask her since it never leads to anything. I can’t pay for therapy myself so I need to ask her. Is there any way to convince her or are there any alternative ways I could get help.
Thank you in advance."
Loneliness,4,mkzx2r,2,"I don't post anything on reddit but I just want to hear what some people think so I'll keep it short. 

Is it bad to have been so lonely for so long that now it's at the point I don't even care anymore. It almost feels like I can't get any more lonely. I have a few friends and family but even when I'm around them it doesn't change it, I can make a happy face but I never really feel happy and the few times I do it dissapears quickly. I just want to know what you redditors think. Is being this lonely something I should go talk more about or something I should reach out for. I really don't want to talk to like doctors if possible. It's just not a good feeling. It's been a few years since it's started and I'm worried it could get worse since I don't care at this point. 

If you took the time to read this thank you. And I hope you have a good day."
I feel that my situation is gonna get me fired from my PhD program (sorry if it's too long text),3,ml1nyx,1,"Hi all, first post here.
I'm a grad student, closeted homosexual and biker/car guy. 
This past few months have been horrible for me, I haven't been able to sleep properly, although I spend most of my time in bed, so I'm constantly tired and feel super slow in everything. My tasks for the research have been piling up and I have not been able to do any step forward, and now everytime that I think about it I become sad and melancholic and end up crying. 
My professor already threatened me about getting me fired and although I don't love my field, I don't know what to do if that happens. Although I kind of want to quit my PhD to be honest.

I don't know how to reach out for help and I don't want to talk about it with my family. I tried to reach out to the university counseling and they said they are full and recommend me to a stupid website that should be cover by my health insurance but it is giving me issues with that. 
I feel that I have no friends and no one that I can open up, any suggestion will be welcome

Love,
Jay"
i’m helpless,2,ml3x4o,0,"i’m so fucking annoying and idk what to do. i suppressed my feelings and emotions for so long and i finally let everything out and think life is good for once but then no. all my friends get driven away, all the people i look up to, my family, everyone. who’s next? my bf? my only true friend? i feel like i’m in middle school again. i have no one. i have my cat and very few places to rant. but then again those ranting places aren’t even reliable because the people i think i can trust talk shit behind my back. but whatever. i think it would just be best if i was gone. i wouldn’t bother anyone ever again. my dad wouldn’t have to worry about me being trans ruining his life. my mom has one less burden to worry about. my friends don’t have to put up with my shit any more. my bf wouldn’t be burdened by my neediness and emotional dependence. everything would be so much better if i just fucking disappeared. i love everything so much but i don’t get that same mutual feeling back. if god is real why doesn’t he just kill me yet."
I feel broken,5,mkyfbo,2,"I'm a 23 male and I feel broken. I'm sad all the time. I don't want to talk to anyone when somebody talk to me I get really angry (but I don't show it). And I feel something inside me is broken. When I try to have fun it don't work I don't enjoy it. My brain or body say lay in bed I am tired. I don't know how to describe it. 

What my friends and family think is that I am happy and a good person and funny. But behind my face I am a broken man for almost 1 to 2 year. I can't sleep eat or enjoy things and it is killing me. I am now at the point what is life is it really worth it. 

And I think it has to do with my past and it is hunting me when I try to run away. Because I don't want to face it. I live in another world in my head to escape from reality.

I am really lost if someone can give advice I really appreciate."

Checked Out,2,ml3wsr,2,"I do not know why I am posting here. I do not know what I am reasonably looking for. I guess idc anymore and wanna express how I feel. If not to those I know for a few reasons then to others behind screens.

I am at the end of my rope, my mood swings are constant. This is largely due to years of emotional trauma and my recent attempts to help myself. Getting help I mean.

I know how I feel is irrational, I am not necessarly in a bad place in life all things considered. But the pain is horrible. The chance it may continue longer than it has  kinda makes me feel its not worth it. I am entering a new phase of my life And I am not in a place to take on things or have adversity, things normal in life. I do not have ""it"" mentally to take the next step.

I am not actively suicidal, but I think about it regularly. The idea of death I do not think is concerning to me. Like im not scared or worried about how it may affect others. My reasoning for that is that all relationships are either not bad, perhaps even positive. But not worth enduring for. The other camp is relationships that are negative, so while I am alive and here if things are bad. I do not care what they think otherwise.

Hope is what keeps me going, hope for change. Its why I keep engaged in mental health resources. But I do not know how long I can last. I am just living to breath day to day.

I apologize for the negativity and paragraphs. I may not even respond, but this is how I feel."
I just want someone to talk to for a while,3,ml1jqc,1,"I don't want to bother anyone, but my problem is that I feel lonely, my parents turned their back on me and I'm closed in my room with nothing else to do all day and I'm slowly losing my sanity (If I'm still sane, I don't know), I get anxious at random times and think of leaving things forever for once.

I asked for therapy but my parents keep telling me I'm okay and that they know everything will get fine, but no, I'm lonely, they don't understand I need to socialize, even if people are scary, I need to be around people, I want people to talk to and be myself and express my feelings in an open way.

Also, is there a way to keep my mind busy? I used to play videogames all day but everything is so boring now, I hate the toxicity nowadays. I've tried drawing again and doing art stuff but it doesn't feel the same way as it did when I was younger. I have no motivation to learn new stuff either. I don't know what to do."

Invalidated by one of my closest friends...,1,ml6qsv,0,"This happened a couple weeks ago but I’m still really upset about what happened. Keep in mind that he states that he’s depressed as well. I also did NOT tell him much about what I was going through so I don’t know why he was acting like I was constantly annoying him with my issues? I will just quote some of the things he said to me:

“You’re acting like the world’s over, like your life is at its end. Get over it, it’s not that deep. Everyone has problems, you’re always talking about ending your life. That’s problematic.”

“You’re attention seeking.”

“You’re always like “I hate life omg omg” then do something about it.”

“You’re blowing up my dms about being suicidal like ?”

“You told me you wanted to kill yourself, why tell me if you were going to do it.”

“You’re victimizing yourself by saying your parents being mean and strict is ruining your life and emotionally traumatizing you. I know what they’re doing is wrong, but you saying you want to kill yourself over it is extreme.”

“Nobody suicidal would tell people they’re gonna do it, which is why it looks like you’re attention seeking.”

(I told him that it’s fine now and that it doesn’t matter anymore.) “Then it was never severe enough to kill yourself over in the first place, if you’re fine now.”

“You know I’m right, don’t be sensitive.”"
What’s the point of life?,2,ml3cpx,0,"What did I do to deserve such a horrible life?

Throughout my entire life it’s truly a tragedy. I’ve lived such a horrible life. My parents are absolute sociopaths. I literally hate my father so fucking much. He’s not a nice guy. He’s never emotionally supportive towards me and he’s never there for me and he never takes responsibility for his actions and never sees what he did that was wrong. My mother is the same way she provokes me into fights all the time. Nobody in my family cares about me and the saddest tragedy of all is that I cut off all my friends because they always say how my family cares when they know nothing about that And they left me. A therapist I thought cared about me, left me on the street to dry. I have PTSD and borderline personality disorder and no support from everybody. I was bullied really badly for six years. The society we live it’s such a tragedy how people are so bad. I wish life wasn’t like this. I gave up trying to get help because I truly believe there’s no hope. And if you’re going to comment something saying there’s hope, please remove yourself from my post because you don’t know what I’ve been through it takes a person who is utterly insensitive to say that."

Ive tried talking to friends a little but they dont really seem to get it. I need to talk to someone who understands how it feels, or anyone with advice so im putting this on here.

I have things I enjoy but I just dont know what to do with my life, and I want to get started. I felt my motivation slip away a little today while doing a hobby I usually enjoy and im worried im heading towards a bad period again."

I've kept two journals throughout four years, without them I would've definitely lost my sanity along with my life. I was never happy with the way I saw myself, physically and mentally.

"My bruises are fading, perhaps not for long",2,ml2n8k,0,"My bruises on my right hand, for the most part, have healed. I don't see anymore discoloration and the spots where blood came from on my nuckles seem to be mostly sealed/almost done fading away away (I think). But all I want to do is slam my hand repeatedly again. 

The only thing stopping me at this moment is a girl I recently met who I think I like, but the more we don't talk the more anxiety and depressive thoughts seek there way in. My classes don't help either and may be the main reason I want to, honestly. I don't know how much the thought of her will hold it off, I've sat here for a while just thinking about bruising my hand again. 

I even held a blade (dull) to my arm a few times tonight but it's just leaving scratch marks and I don't know if blades are my thing for now being I can make better excuses for a bruised hand."
I hate myself,3,ml053g,3,"I feel as though I've been self sabotaging my degree. I'm only in my second year and I'm already fucking everything up. 
I can't concentrate for shit and nothing seems to stick anymore. Any practice I try to get with the material is always ineffective and I always end up feeling like shit and so so stupid whenever I try and learn. 
I booked a one to one session with my tutor tomorrow so I can get a little support but, how am I supposed to explain the reason I don't get anything is cause I'm just a lazy piece shit that can't get anything done even when I do try. 
What am I supposed to do if I fail? I have no idea what to do because my degree is integrated into my actual job. If I fail uni I might lose my job too and then I'll be a financial burden on my family, especially because I earn the most out of all of us right now so how am I supposed to deal with the fact that failing means fucking my family over financially for a while as well. I don't know how to keep up with it all."
I've Been At This For 10 Years And I Don't Want To Do It Anymore,2,ml2kqv,0,"When it first started I was in denial. It was going to be a short term thing. I thought. Just let the fog in my head leave. The dark cloud. The self doubt. The hating myself. The loneliness. The inability to focus on anything. Video games and movies were too hard. I just didn't feel great. The doctors just gave me pills and told me to go away. My primary doctor (old school) told me to go to a walk in clinic to get pills going forward. Pawn me off to someone else I guess? That's fine you're a doctor you know best right?

But it didn't get better. Doctors just kept giving me pills. I didn't know how I was supposed to feel. My depression grew and grew. I kept fighting it and thinking if I just get further. If I just hit my goals maybe the depression will go away.

But it didn't. It got worse. I hate living. Therapy. Medication. I've done it all. I cannot get better. Just let me go. My brain is broken. I am broken. 

What gives someone else the right to tell me to hold on? You vomit out hallmark card words and say words that have no fucking meaning. Empty, hallow. Because you don't have to live what I do. The pain is so much. And I can't show you. If I had a bullet in my chest or a broken leg maybe you could understand. But I have my own fucking brain saying no you were born to have depression. You weren't mean to be happy. Your ex ghosted for a reason. Medication doesn't work for a reason. Therapy doesn't work for a reason.

Because when it's all said and done. I have to be with me. I have this thing in my head making life painful. And if I could just go away. Let the depression win. Let it all go I'll be happy.

Please someone find a cure for depression. Something please help. I'm tired of this pain. I'm tired of thinking about the future. I'm tired of just everything."
"Depression has affected my personal and professional life deeply... I wish I had killed myself earlier, honestly.",3,mky7hq,0,"I had thought about suicide ever since I was a child. The earliest I can remember is back to when I was about 11 or 12 years old, then it got worse. 

The point is, I still have it and it’s helped me ruin every small chance I had of being someone in life. I went to a four year college during a period in my life when I thought I could get out and change everything. I was very naive and dumb back then. 

I had many opportunities to succeed economically. But somehow it kicked in. Once I had those opportunities knocking at my door I just didn’t feel like I deserved any of it. And so I would always end up quitting. I ended up homeless and suicidal more than once too. It happens al the time. Every time something good happens to me I push it away because I know that it’s not going to work out, that I don’t deserve it. 

And now, although I went to college, I have a dead end  general labor job that I got through an agency after working as a janitor for a few months for a low paying wage. They recently changed my job duties but I know that they just want to fuck me up with more labor. They know it and I know it. And if they don’t like how I do then they can easily get rid of me and replace me. Because that’s how life is. But at the same time, this job is all I have, it’s all I am now. I think my worst fear now is not having a job because then I’d end up homeless and even more suicidal than before... but at the same time, it represents something I didn’t want to turn into; just a modern slave a miserable servant for others. And this is just how I’m going to die. I’m too old to start again. And the energy I used to have is dead now. I’m just surviving and waiting to die (hopefully soon)."
I hate being relied on/ responsibilities.,7,mkubot,2,"I'm [22m] and I know it's gonna sound childish and dickish, but I felt like I've been asked for help way too for a while now and it's burning me out. I work second shift, so my mornings are always available which resulted in all the favors and chores I've been asked to help out with. I'd help watch my sister's kids, drive my Mom way early to work everyday and other  given stuff to do along the way. 

I felt like the last couple months was a  rollercoaster because a while back I would have simple mornings to chill and relax before work, but for a while now it's a constant on and off, mornings filled up and then go straight to work. It's been stressing me out so much now, especially since I have to go to bed as soon as I get home to drive Mom to work.  No free time at all. 
Even my free time off work is used due to being asked for favors. When I do have legit free time, I'm too tired to do anything and decide to sleep. 

I live with my Mom rent free and she has been so good to me , so I know I shouldn't be complaining, buts it's really been eating at my how much limited time I have to myself is going away. I just want time to be me, and all this stress is just causing my depression to go haywire at times. I try my best to hide it, buts it's just getting worse. 

I know in the end I'm just being a bitch, but I felt like I needed to rant to someone(being the internet lol), so forgive me for being selfish!"
I’m not really sure what to do.,2,ml2fiq,3,"I’m in grade ten and I’m not averaging very well in any of my subjects.

On top of that I have to watch all the people around me excel in there grades without even really trying. My work ethic has never been good. I just don’t posses the will to try, and I REALLY want to change that but I just don’t know how or even if I can. I contemplated suicide many times and even told my parents which they really just avoided the topic and told me to focus on school more. When this pandemic hit I haven’t been doing well mentally, physically, academically, or socially either. I feel like I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this, so I’m resorting to random strangers online."
I'm so dumb,9,mksdrr,2,"I went in specifically to use the coupon my sister won and I didn't even use it just bought gas.  I'm so fucking stupid.  How does someone do that???  I literally just didn't think about it.  I can't do SHIT right, I'm like genuinely retarded.  No one likes me because I'm so stupid and I fuck up every single day.

"I think my [22F] boyfriend [26M] is depressed and I don't know how to deal with it, he doesn't want to seek help or talk about his emotions. I'm getting a bit desperate. What should I do?",3,mkziha,3,"I have been in a beautiful loving relationship for the past 2 years with someone that constantly shows he loves me and demonstrates respect towards me and our relationship. As a person that has been diagnosed with depression, I can notice the symptoms quicker than most people. My boyfriend spends most of his days feeling beyond exhausted and unmotivated, sleeps during most of his free time and as soon as he leaves work (he has a nine to five full time job), he always feels like ""he's not that special"" and constantly diminishes how amazing of a human being he can be. Due to covid restrictions I have not been able to see him for months because we are simply not allowed to travel, and he just keeps getting worse since he has been isolated and isolating himself from the world. He barely has any motivation to do anything, and pretty much has not left his place in months, unless it is for 5 seconds to go take out the trash.

I try to talk to him every day but there are days where we do not even facetime because he is already asleep at 6pm, and I just keep getting more concerned. He only talks about his emotions when we have strong arguments after his feelings build up and even then, I feel like he has a lot of trouble expressing himself, and it makes conflict resolution way more complicated than what it could be. I try to respect his boundaries and not confront him with things that make him uncomfortable, but usually he simply brushes my questions off with an ""I'm just tired"", and never wants to talk about what is really going on.

I have been doing therapy for some time now and I believe it has helped me a lot when it comes to communicating my feelings and understanding what I am going through inside my head. I strongly believe it could help him too.

I am aware that this is something that cannot be forced. I have tried, more than once, and unsuccessfully, to talk to him about it and make him see that he should not be embarrassed about going to therapy and that it is important to talk to someone about how we feel – that this someone does not have to be me, and that it would be good if that someone was a person that knew what to say and how to help him.

He says he just does not think it is necessary, and that I need to stop mentioning it (his responses make me feel like me saying therapy could help him attacks his sense of “masculinity” a bit). Where I come from, there is a strong feeling against therapists and a culture of ignoring mental issues since it is seen as a weakness to “need” to see a therapist – I feel like this could be something stopping him too.

I know he has had a bad experience after few sessions with a terrible therapist growing up, and this helped him lose faith in this method of healing. Knowing that he does not talk to anyone about his feelings makes me worry a lot.

A few months ago we had a conversation with a friend in common, and my boyfriend admitted to us that he thought maybe he did need therapy after the things he went through in his life – I found him some therapist recommendations afterwards through my therapist, but when I talked to him about it a few days later he got upset and said he didn’t really mean it, and that he doesn’t want to spend money on something “he doesn’t need”.

Since he has been spending his time isolated due to restrictions and cannot see other people, I cannot help but be more and more concerned about his mental well-being. I do not want to be annoying or upset him, I just wanted him to do something that could help him heal. It did not have to be therapy, that is just the suggestion I give him – because it is the only thing I know that helps deal with these terrible feelings.

I fear what might happen to him or to our relationship if he does not seek help.

Have you ever been in a similar situation? How can I support him and help him, knowing I can’t be physically there for him and that our online contact is slightly compromised by his constant need to sleep? Should I keep mentioning therapy, or is that too invasive at this point?

Thank you in advance for any advice 😊."
I don’t think I’ll make it to graduation,3,mkw67h,0,"hey all, i hope your first week of april is good. 

i guess i’m at my wits end and looking for advice anywhere i can get it. i’m 21/M, and i’ve suffered with chronic treatment-resistant depression for as long as i can remember (officially diagnosed at 15). over the course of my mental illness journey, i’ve tried over a dozen medications, looked into alternative treatments (ECT, ketamine, etc.), and have been in different types of therapy for six years. while painful, it’s usually manageable, but i’ve had severe episodes periodically and a really rough suicide attempt that landed me in the ICU for a few days, plus the subsequent psych ward hospitalization for two weeks at 17. 

i’m a month away from graduating university with my bachelors. i’m graduating with a 4.0 GPA, a double major, and a year early, all on-top of always working a part time job or internship and on-campus leadership positions throughout my college experience and having mental illness. however, the past month has been some of the most painful weeks of my life, and my suicidal ideation has only grown. i’m deeply scared i won’t even make it to graduation, even after i’ve worked so hard. none of these achievements mean anything to me at this point in time. this most recent episode was brought on a month ago by my first real boyfriend breaking up with me out of no where, and i’ve taken it extremely rough. not only is a break-up a hard thing to deal with, but it’s really plunged me into a severe depressive episode and activated unhealthy behaviors. i cry several times a day, don’t have the motivation to do any of my work or assignments, and am highly suicidal. it’s similar to past episodes i’ve had (the most recent being last october), and i usually make it through (albeit with emotional scars and pain) with time and lots of therapy and help, but this one feels different and a lot worse.

any tips from fellow mentally ill friends on how to deal with an episode and the break-up? you think with years of experience and dealing with depression i would know what helps lol. any tips on what to do when you’re highly suicidal and how to resolve that? i just can’t be hospitalized (even though that’s probably the best option) at this point in time since i would have to push graduation and everything. and i know that shouldn’t matter because my mental health and staying alive should be first priority, but i can’t just turn my back on all my effort i’ve made. but it’s getting too painful on the daily basis to go on. anyways, thanks for listening and would love some wisdom from people who deal with depression or similar situation."

Depressed teenagers are not taken seriously,6,mkvqy1,1,"It's not a hot new take, I know, but I wanted to get it off my chest.  
Teenage depression is too often dismissed as a typical teenage behavior.   
They are typically seen as moody, irritable, they lock themselves in their rooms, love to sleep in, don't care too much about school. It's considered normal, so depression is often overlooked.   
It makes it tough to recognize a teen who genuinely needs help.  
Sometimes makes me second guess if I made my depression up.  
I see teens online who think mental illness is 'fun and quirky', and they annoy me, but I'm even more angry at adults who seem to ridicule every teenager who claims to be sad and not doing okay, because it's just a 'teenage angst' and 'wait till the real world hits you and you have to work a minimal wage job, then you'll have it tough'..."

I don’t know what to do,2,ml1krp,0,"I’m pretty sure my wife hates my parents.

Any time we get an opportunity to spend time with them she gets super mad and starts screaming about having to play hostess. She’s graduating in a few weeks and they wanted to come celebrate with us and maybe just maybe spend a little bit of time with us, so they decided to get a hotel room.

This just won’t do. My mil and sil are going to be here the same weekend and that will just be too many people. She just wants to relax and spend time with her mom and sister, who she sees multiple times a year.

I barely get to see my parents 2-3 times a year, and I’m usually by myself when I do.

Beyond that, I’m pretty sure her family doesn’t like me. At Christmas, they all bought gifts for her, but left me out of it. Her mom just brought her an Easter basket, but left me out of it. They’ve straight up told her if I was their husband, I would’ve been gone a long time ago.

I feel like my marriage is sinking, but I love my wife and don’t want to lose her.

How can someone be in a relationship when they have mental health issues?,12,mkopca,6," After threading several subreddits discussing social skills, making friendship, etc, I find it rather puzzling how someone who claims to have mental health issues (ranging from social anxiety, depression, avoidance disorder, etc) can have a partner.

I have a social anxiety and have fallen into depression during pandemic, although I'm now on meds and practising many exercises to get better. Although I have been on several dates, I found that my mental health disturbance had played a big part in the failures of all those. I'm now rather scared to date again and keep saying to myself that I should heal first. However, part of healing and reducing social anxiety (also loneliness that causes me depression) is by meeting more people and put myself in uncomfortable situations, including meeting someone new and willing to be vulnerable.

That's been said, I wonder if it's ever a good idea to start dating random people again? And how can someone who has social anxiety and depression gets a partner?"

I have nothing left to give,8,mkt4wn,3,"I’ve always felt like life was hard for me to deal with when I was younger and as I got older, I my depression worsened to the point of multiple attempts at suicide and seconds thoughts about it as I was attempting. I finally got help last year and began to see a therapist and I’m on medication. It helped a little and then my wife decided she wanted a divorce. I lost my job two weeks later and I felt my whole world collapse around me. I had to sell my house, I had to move back with my parents and my family provided almost no support for me up front. My dad told me to grow up when I broke down in tears at the kitchen table after my wife decided to make it difficult to see my son. I don’t think I ever felt as low as I did in that moment. I ran up to my room and called my therapist and talked to him for a while. When I came back down, my mom told me not to run off like that again and not call my therapist when I had a little meltdown. She also said I shouldn’t waste my money on therapy. 

At this point, I’ve found employment with higher pay. I’m on track to get a good amount of money from selling my house and I’ll be able to find my own place soon. I feel totally hopeless and empty though because I don’t have that special someone that would be there for me no matter what. That someone who I can hug and feel protected. That someone who I can say I love you to and she will say it back. I know I’m still grieving over my marriage ending, but I want to have someone I can be with. I feel like a robot almost at work. I take adderall to focus at work and then I spend the rest of the evening and night methodically doing whatever else I need to do. To me now, marriage means nothing. Vows mean nothing. I honestly don’t want to get married again because I divorce is painfully long and expensive. I hate seeing couples in love, weddings make me sick and I really don’t want to be my best friend’s best man. All I want is someone to just love and accept me.

How to deal with having a bad personality,3,mkyvj2,0,i constantly hate the way i act and always put myself down in public and have created a horrible image of myself. how do i deal with the fact that i obviously have a bad personality as all my friends have left me and no guy has ever showed any interest in me even though i am (relatively)attractive i think. i don’t know how to fix this please help me i am very lost and alone. any tips on how to change my personality and create a better reputation for myself are much needed. at this point i think i just have to move to a new city where everyone doesn’t think i’m a stupid brain dead druggy whore even though i literally never have sex.
Going to family gatherings is painful,6,mkvfvy,1,"Lately I've been really really depressed and am just gonna spill my guts here. The last week or so has been particularly bad. I oversleep, sometimes when I wake up I immediately start crying, basically all I do these days is cry and then get back to life. I also just really don't want to see people. I've been making excuses saying that I just have heaps of assignments (which is partially true) but it's honestly because I can't face seeing people.

I haven't left my house properly in months. And like I said, I'm just a mess and almost always want to cry. I went to a family gathering for the first time in a long time last night and I'm not joking when I say there were a few moments where I almost cried. I just didn't have the energy to fake a smile or act outgoing and interesting. I have nothing to say. It was painful talking to my niece. I tried my best to smile and say a few things but it was just really uncomfortable and I just felt bad. 

It was embarrassing explaining to my niece that I have no friends, or why I wasn't talking, or why I was ""studying"" all the time. I have this feeling that my sister has been talking about it. I mean what kind of 9 year old asks about things like 'what career I want to have' or 'if I failed at uni last year'. I mean, how does my niece even know that. 

I felt weird when my sister talked in this weird ""sympathetic"" voice. Its hard to explain but when she knows I'm down she talks to me like I'm a kid who just fell down and grazed their knee. And I know they have no bad intentions. I'm not mad about it, I just feel like an alien. 

It feels like I want to be happy not for myself but because people expect me to be. Like I need to smile more, be more energetic, be talkative. I'm good at pretending to be happy. Ive always done that. But now it just feels like I can't be bothered doing that anymore. And I'm tired of pretending to have things together and being expected to when I just don't."
Family is not everything when they treat you like an object. If I could mentally take a back seat and peace out for a little while then I would.,3,mkwv8b,1,"I’m tired of walking around eggshells over people that don’t know the meaning of the word no. I’m tired of constantly being the “adult” to adults that are well into their 50s.

Family means absolutely nothing if the people around you constantly gaslight you, treat you like an object, and expect you to smile in their face and say “good morning, good night” BECAUSE since they’re family they deserve that basic respect. I guess I don’t deserve that respect in return, right?

So I guess it only matters that *you’re* treated right, fuck me because I’m younger. Fuck me for wanting to focus on my studies and talk to the little Friends that I have left. Fuck me for wanting to spend time to tend to the hobbies that are no longer enjoyable because of my depression. Screw me for trying to hold onto something to make myself even a little bit happier.

fuck me for focusing on all of those things and not you at every moment you need me at any time of the day. Fuck me for not replying to your demands to take you anywhere and Fuck me for having the audacity to get mad when you don’t even bother to ask if I have anything to do.

I’m not going to kill myself but some days I wish I could just to get it through this mans thick skull how much of an effect he has on me.

Infuriated! For decent mental health help in the US you have to be wealthy to afford it with insurance.,4,mktx9t,0,"My son has made some serious mistakes and suffers deeply with depression, RAD and others.

I need help. Here’s my story.,9,mkp8gt,5,"I need help. 

I hope no one minds if I tell my story. I have no one to talk to about this, and I feel like writing it out might help me. 

I am severely depressed and suicidal. It all started with me moving away for college last summer. I was in a good headspace at the time. Over the Summer, I had become close friends with one of my neighbors. We hung out almost everyday and it made me feel like a normal person. Things were also going well with my long distance girlfriend of three years. I was feeling like my life was finally getting back on track after a lot of past trauma such as false rape accusations and friends that were like brothers turning on me. I had hope for the future. I moved into a small house off of campus, and everything started to go downhill from there. I was so lonely. I didn’t know anyone in that town. Due to covid, everything with my school was online. I didn’t leave the house except to buy food and to visit my girlfriend once every two weeks. I basically stayed in my small room for 6 months straight. My close friend called me, and asked me if I hung out with anyone besides him. I told him no and explained why. He hung up and ghosted me after that. My mental health was rapidly deteriorating. My anxiety was horrible, and panic attacks were becoming more and more frequent. I thought of suicide every day. As my mental health deteriorated, so did my relationship with my girlfriend. I was constantly paranoid about something happening to her. I became obsessive. She was all I had, so I became way too reliant on her. Everything she did got to me. She had lots of friends, and the time she was willing to spend texting or calling me was decreasing. She seemed disinterested in me and didn’t want to talk about my mental health issues. She barely told me she loved me or complimented me anymore. I became absolutely pathetic. I lashed out a lot, and we had a lot of fights. She would call me insane and lots of other names. It destroyed me. I realized that if this relationship continued, I was going to end up killing myself. I told my parents about the situation and they asked me to move back home for my own safety. I ended things and we actually managed to go out peacefully and on good terms. This gave me a lot of inner peace. She said she really wanted to be friends eventually and to reach out if I ever needed her. I made some progress with myself after that. I got a job, started exercising, tanning, and became a vegetarian. Fast forward two months and she blocked me on snapchat. I’m not really sure when it happened because I had my social media’s deleted for a while. I decided to ignore it, but it really hurt me. It felt like all the progress I made in getting over her just disappeared. I just couldn’t manage to get it off of my mind. Why would she do this after we ended things so peacefully and she told me all these nice things. I didn’t do anything that could possibly upset her since we broke up. This weighed on me heavily for a few days. Last night, after not being able to sleep because of it, I texted her and asked her why she blocked me. She hasn’t responded. I feel pathetic for reaching out to her, and terrified that the woman who was once everything to me, now hates me. I feel like everyone hates me. I don’t know what to do and I could really use some kind words or encouragement. If you read all of this, thank you for listening to my story."
I feel like I'm not cut out for this life.,3,mkygl9,1,"I just feel so weak. I graduated at the end of 2019, worked until summer 2020 where I had to stop due to covid. After months of job searching (and months of my dad telling me over and over again to find a job, even though I was trying!) I finally landed a job. And a week in, I already want to quit. 

It isn't even a ""hard"" job - I'm working as a counselor at a dog daycare where you clean and maintain the yards, as well as manage the dogs in the yards (upwards of 25 large dogs at a time, on your own). Since starting I'm tired all of the time (even though my longest shift so far was only 6 hours), as it is draining work, and I also feel like I'm not a good fit for it. I don't have that dominant, ""head of the pack"" vibe and whenever things get hectic I start feeling very anxious and sorta freeze up. But I spent so long getting a job, and all of my friends and family are happy for me, so I feel like I have to toughen up and deal with it. I just don't have the motivation or energy for it all.

At the same time, I constantly find myself thinking that a future where I spend almost all of my time working isn't what I want. Having to work 8-9 hours a day, 5-6 days a week for the rest of my life sounds like hell. I could barely function mentally (I have depression and anxiety) working the 35-40 hours I would before the pandemic hit. I don't know how I can do it for the rest of my life.

And don't even get me started on not being able to find the motivation to do anything because the world is falling apart and turning to shit as we know it. What's the point if we're basically already past the ""point of no return"" for climate change? Or that if I were to drop dead, any modern employer would have an ad for my now vacant position before my body turned cold.

This ended up longer and more rambly than I intended. Thanks for reading if you made it this far, any words of encouragement or advice would be greatly appreciated."
Close to the edge.,3,mkyf6z,0,"I’m 22 and autistic.
I’ve come very close to committing suicide twice in the last year.
I’ve tried counselling through various services, anti depressants, lifestyle changes etc.
I don’t know what else I can do. I feel like I’ve done all I can get to get support but nothing has changed my mind.

I thought everything was getting better.,2,ml0xvz,0,"Landlord sold the home we rent, have us 60 days starting today to move to a new home. My head hurts too much to type much more than that, it’s just nice to get it out. I hope the VA calls me tomorrow. I hope you all have a wonderful day."
Seeking help is expensive,2,ml0xce,1,"Many people say to seek help but at what cost? Help is expensive be it a therapist, a rehabilitation center, health checkups, blood tests, nutritional doctors, dentists and especially if you’re not getting help from any source because you’re depressed and because you have chronic health issues which also contribute. Then living with toxic individuals who find pure joy in bringing you down every chance they get and every-time they see you is nauseating. Unfortunately this world works with money, you have to pay to live, pay to eat and pay to get any help. Not many of us have the privilege of getting help, instead we wait until the light goes out.. until our hearts stop beating.. because what else is there if you’re born to fight alone?"
How do I deal with these people,2,ml0sdq,1,"People that I know constantly ignore me, hurt me, bash me, etc... Yet when I try to ignore them and do my own thing they don't just stop or get bored of me, they suddenly act all super friendly and bug the hell out of me and try to joke with me and ask what's wrong and try to be all helpful and crap. It's annoying that nearly everyone I know does this. They're all two-faced. My bullies, acquaintances, ""friends"", etc... Hell even my own family does this to me sometimes. I want to just tell them all to leave me along but I don't know how to do this without sounding like an ass. Any advice?

I'm tired of them making me feel like crap and then getting special treatment to get yoyo'd around emotionally for whatever their reasons are."
I actually am different,5,mkuqhl,1,It’s hard to accept but I know it’s true. I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 12 but I didn’t want to believe it. I guess I was so good at masking I even fooled myself... I’m 20 and now I have no other choice but to believe it because I have an autistic burnout. My therapist and psychologist agree with me. It began a few months back and I eventually had to quit school because of it on October 30th 2019. I recently had to quit my parttime job at a pizzeria too (Even though I only worked 4 to 8 hours a week) because I began feeling even worse. I don’t know how to deal with feelings this bad anymore. Why is my brain like this...
Waking up to zero messages is f*cking bullsh*t,3,mky515,4,"I don't even expect anyone to read this. 

Seeing all the people I know having hundreds of followers on social media while having almost none doesn't seem to be a big deal at first. Having hundreds of followers wouldn't even be something I wanted to show off with BUT all these peoples' followers are the people I know as well. Like, they don't even recognize I exist. 

Seeing them with all their perfect lives makes me f*cking sick. Imagining them waking up to a dozen of people asking them about how they are while not having anyone myself makes me sick.

I don't even get any messages from anyone in months. Nobody cares about me. Oh, and please don't reply with ""You need someone to care about you? You're only able to look after yourself."" I'm sick of answers like this as well."
What is your appetite for risk in Outdoor Recreation activities? [Research],3,mky1kn,2,"Please consider participating in a survey on how people perceive risks associated with outdoor activities.

In particular, I am looking for participants who identify as being affected by depressive disorder or depressive tendencies.

Further information is below. The survey can be found at this link and is for people aged 18 and over:

https://www.research.net/r/PKM230ID11611765  

**Why am I asking this?**

I am teaching the course Social Psychology of Risk offered by Charles Sturt University (Australia) as part of the degree Bachelor of Outdoor Recreation. A whole section of this course is dedicated to the psychological / mental health benefits / sense of empowerment that participants can derive from these activities.

While research has looked at participants in specific activities, we have no real idea how the wider public perceives the risks associated with outdoor activities. Indeed, most people seem to assume that only adrenalin junkies and alpha-fe/males engage in many outdoor adventure recreation activities. To move beyond mere assumptions, I have designed and distributed a survey.

While I have had a good uptake, the numbers of participants who identify as having a disability (in the broadest terms) has been very low. I am very keen change this, as I am hoping to be able to demonstrate that the appetite for risk among people who identify as affected by depressive disorder or depressive tendencies will, in most instances, not be any different from that of any one else.

I strongly believe that members of the subReddit are eminently qualified to comment on their perceptions of risk in outdoor activities.

Can you please consider the survey. It consists of a front end with some general demographic questions and then general attitudes towards Outdoor Recreation activities, followed by questions regarding specific activities. Some of these specific activities require social interaction, others do not.

**Ethics approval**

The survey has been approved by Charles Sturt University's Ethics in Human Research Committee. 

The background to the project as well as the participant information sheet can be found here: 

http://csusap.csu.edu.au/\~dspennem/Risk/RiskProject.html

Participation in the survey is purely voluntary and all responses are anonymous.

**What will happen with the data?**

The survey data will be used by students to design Adventure Outdoor Recreation Programs for specific cohorts (as part of their final assessment) and I will be using the data to write several research overviews. These will inform the profession and will also inform the training of future outdoor guides, activity leaders and outdoor activity providers. When the analysis is completed, I will be only too happy to report back in this subReddit.

Here is link for the survey again:

https://www.research.net/r/PKM230ID11611765  

Please note that there is no 'right' or 'wrong' answer. It is all about ***your*** ***personal*** perception of risk.

The survey should take about 20-25 min to complete. I am fully aware that it is a complex and detailed questionnaire, and thus its completion requires some time commitment, but I can assure you that this detail is necessary in order to be able to carry out a nuanced analysis.

Mobile device users please be aware that SurveyMonkey may display not all of the answers on page on your screen and you may have to scroll horizontally or down as well to see everything. I apologise for this issue that seems to be beyond my control.

Thank you very much for your kind consideration.

Parental Problems and Teen Depression,2,ml0kjw,0,"I’m a 15 yo boy and I’ve been struggling with depression for a few years now. When I tried to discuss this with my parents they just said that it’s probably just the age that I’m at and acted like it wasn’t even a problem. My parents also have completely different views on how I should live my life as I believe that the best way to go about my life to to try to be as happy as possible and in the future to earn enough to support a family. My parents believe that the most important thing in life is hard work and only care about me getting a good job and not a job I enjoy. Because of this they have really pushed me to get good grades which I’m fine with, I do feel great accomplishment from doing well in school, but for some reason they can’t grasp the concept that it really takes a lot out of me. They are constantly pushing for me to get involved in sports but I do CrossFit twice a week and am quite healthy. They say it will help because doing sports looks good on my record but doing good in school takes so much out of me that I can’t bring myself to get involved in other activities. I also struggle in social situations and don’t have many friends. I don’t hang out with the friends I do have that often. A big reason for this is that last summer my parents forced me to take up a landscaping job that mostly included sprinkler installation for a small company my dad just started. I had to work 20-25 hours a week so I didn’t have much time to spend with my friends and sense the start of the school year we have been kind of distant. And despite my parents adding to my social skills being difficult they still constantly get mad at me for it. My parents are trying to force me to do landscaping again this summer and no matter what I say they think its what’s best for me. I know that it’s not best for me because last summer I was constantly considering killing myself and I don’t think I can make it through a second time. I haven’t told them about what I’m going through recently because as I mentioned before they just shrugged me off. They also treat me like I’m so immature and don’t just don’t understand anything. This really bugs me as I consider myself pretty mature but just saying that makes me seem like an immature little kid. It seems the only way they would truly believe that what I’m going through is real is killing myself. At this point the only reason I haven’t committed sucked is that I’m just scared of how painful it would be. I know this whole post is lengthy and doesn’t necessarily follow a certain theme but I just want to know what I’m supposed to do in my life.
Please help me, what do I do?"
Wanting to protect my family and friends from hurt can't be enough anymore,2,ml0jqj,0,"For all those reading this - thank you and I am sorry to throw one more heavy post on the pile. 

I've never truly gotten close to real suicidal intention for a variety of reasons. The main one is the ol' ""I couldn't do that to my loved ones"" chestnut and I know I'm not the first to feel this way. 

Lately though, I've realised that this isn't enough anymore.
That preventative check used make me feel safe. Knowing that, for as long as I still cared about the hurt it would cause, I could never do it. 
But now I just feel trapped.
I feel like I'm dying all the time, but I can never actually go. Like my screen has frozen and even the power button won't work.
This sounds clunky and pretentious but, I don't know how else to explain it.

I can't live like this, but I'm terrified that I just *will* any way.
Has anyone else felt this way?"
We’re doomed to fail if you have a mental illness...,3,mkxtpb,0,"Thanks for my neurotransmitters not functioning and messed up brain chemistry!

I don’t know if I can do this anymore,2,ml0cwr,0,"I don’t even know how to put this in writing but I don’t know where to reach out anymore. I’m tired of battling my head on wanting to end my life I’m tired of fighting off the want to self harm I’m tired of the anxiety that crippled me everyday. I can’t see a future for me and i know everything would be easier if I wasn’t here. I’ve been trying to manage my mental health for over 15 years and I’ve come to the tipping point. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue last year and cannot not work, I’m in so much debt I can’t even pick up the calls to try and work out payment plans, I’m currently on Centrelink but the money isn’t much as I pay for my medications. Over the last year of Covid and lockdowns I lost my job, my grandparents, helping my partner become sober and trying to deal with this chronic pain. Last month I found out I was pregnant but because of my poor health and money issues my partner and I knew the right step was a termination as we wouldn’t be able to provide a home ready for a child and this has broken me, I feel like I can’t hold on anymore I don’t see the happiness in the world anymore and I just want it to be over but the thought of hurting the ones I love makes it harder this battle in my head is killing me. I don’t think I’ll never be rid of my suicidal thoughts. I hate myself, I hate that I can’t work and I can’t get a hold on paying debt. I’m just scared of failing to commit suicide again because last time I failed and my family really held in against me.
I don’t know what to do anymore and I don’t want to keep being a burden to my partner and I know I would be better off not living anymore"
I don’t know what to do anymore.,3,mkxqa9,0,"I’m a teenager, 16 years old, male. 

I feel like everyone around me is bored of me or takes no like to me. None of my past friends talk to me and I’m usually left on delivered or they are “busy” all the time too much for me. I disappoint my girlfriend constantly and try to change but this heavy pound of depression won’t let me be fun or happy. I have terrible IBS and literally feel like I’m going to sh!t myself all the time. I have no motivation to do anything. All I do is go to the gym and try to work my heart out to be happy with myself and my body but I don’t even want to do it anymore. I cry myself to sleep majority of the time or just don’t sleep at all. I was so excited for this spring but I ended up hurting people and consisting it of causing arguments or being ignored by people I thought were my friends. I guess this is just me venting I don’t know. Maybe someone relating to this might help or some advice I just don’t know what to do. I know I’m 16 and I have time to change but I just can’t find the motivation inside to be happy."
How does one endure long term depression exacerbated by prolonged social isolation?,2,ml05wv,2,"Living abroad and having chronic health problems which have made me mostly bedridden, I have had to go through very long periods of social isolations.

I was doing so well and I just slipped up,10,mkorbu,1,I don’t even know what’s wrong with me I was doing great doing what I had to do making an effort with life . Then everything just stopped and I fell back in the deep dark hole. I’ve been over eating badly and staying in bed all they I have no motivation to do anything. I cut my hair during an episode last night and I hate myself so much for it and I’ve been eating so freaking much on top of all that. I am back to school next week I am so scared I just hope I’m able to get through it because there’s only 2 more months left
Why is everything so monotone,32,mkhdqb,5,"I feel like a husk of a human being. No drive or desire to do anything in life. I’m lost, nothing is fun, I have no friends irl, I sleep all day and when I’m not I’m sitting in my room doing nothing. Not even video games are fun anymore. Starting to think being alive is pointless I keep wondering what the point of life is. Why live in a planet we are slowly destroying as a being who’s kind is slowly self destructing themselves. I feel guilty though when I think of my situation compared to some others out there. Wish I could give my life to someone who deserves it and actually wants to do something with it."

"When I completely open up , important people in my life are overwhelmed , blame themselves or get hurt , and me too",2,mkzucv,1,"When I am truly and honest about my thoughts and feelings, friends get really really sad and worried and I feel like a burden cause they already struggle so much with themselves ( depression , eating disorders, suicidal thoughts etc ) 

A few got really shocked when I told them about how fucked up my brain thinks / and feels , especially when it’s something that has to do with them 
Then they just don’t know what to say , or get hurt 

Or they just say something that triggers a specific topic I thought about much the last time ( that’s why I’m already unstable) and I just can’t think about what the said in the most negativst way possible ( my brain just make me seem like  the grossest , weak  , fucked up loser ever about what they said related to that topic ) , 
anf they end up seeing how “down “ sad , silent etc I am and blame themselves for that.
And then I‘m the one who feels shitty about it all and the over dramatic reaction of my brain to every shit .

Also it’s just more or less the same issues that repeat themselves and are triggered by some events or I just thought about more the last time.
They already said everything they could"
I'm almost done,6,mksaf3,3,"I really can't do it anymore. 

I moved to a new state last year to be closer to family and to accept a new job and to try and breathe life into an old relationship and give it a ""second go"". It all fell apart in 5 months. I was fired without cause from the job, lost the relationship partner a few weeks after that and have been unemployed for 8 months. 

I have interviewed tirelessly at companies with varying levels of success. No real offers still. There was one which I refer to as the ""platinum standard"" of positions that I have been in the running for since January '21. I completed FIVE interviews with them, and two online assessments and a submission of work samples. Found out today that they no longer want to move forward with me, despite all conversations feeling positive. 

Also just got a letter from a collection agency today for an amount owed from my prior apartment complex that I didn't know about because they misspelled my forwarding address in their system. So my credit score may take a massive hit even though I payed it in full immediately.

I'm completely emotionally drained. I feel like I'm lying to myself when I say things are going to get better. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up."
I have to act like I’m severely depressed for people to see it but because I still go to work everyone keeps telling me I’m fine. I can’t keep doing this,2,mkzme1,0,"I’m floundering. I’ve always had poor mental health due to childhood trauma and just bullshit but it’s gotten really bad. The pandemic ripped what little bit of hope I had left, 2020 was the year I worked for and was supposed to help my mental health and boy are we in trouble. I have a plan out, multiple actually and I spend every day wishing I wasn’t here. I’ve completely stopped taking care of myself and just don’t care. I’ve literally never been in a worse spot, I get out of bed for work and I shower with my fiancé nightly and he helps me wash my hair (literally a hero and saint). But I go to work everyday because calling out and being flakey would ruin my reputation which I don’t want (my parents ingrained it in me that you have to be seen as responsible and reliable or you’re nothing) and we’re extremely short staffed so I’d leave them in a shitty situation which makes me feel guilty. I try to express how bad I’m feeling and that I’m really struggling but because I still pick myself up, do the things I’m supposed to and all of that no one is wanting to register the severity my mental health has gotten to. I literally told a lead who also openly struggles with mental health that I don’t want to be here anymore and had a full breakdown but they said they weren’t going to tell the owners (which is a good part) because they know I’ll be fine and show up to work which kinda broke me a little because no matter how badly I say I’m doing they don’t see it with their eyes so it isn’t there. I just don’t know what I do. It’s the same with my parents and even my fiancé sometimes but he of course gets it more because he sees how little I’m functioning. I just don’t know what to do and I don’t want to start calling out and being unreliable because that’s what they expect of someone in my state but I also really need people to see and understand because I’m not doing ok and I can’t keep doing this"
"Not having suicide as an option due to caring too much about the effect it would have on loved ones.. I’m sure most of us relate to this, unfortunately.",416,mk3i8f,58,"I’m 21, and some may say this age, is the best life gets. If that’s the case then I don’t want to live another day. Where I am mentally right now, is the WORST I have ever felt. There is no joy left in life anymore. 

Since was 16 or so, my mental health has been deteriorating rapidly, every single fucking thing makes me anxious now, I get so irritable and angry, it’s exhausting. All this anxiety, self loathing and pure hatred of this awful planet we live in leaves me absolutely fucking hopeless and at the end of my rope, with depression and the lowest self esteem I’ve never experienced.

There is so much pain to go through if I live to old age. More heartbreak, the loss of loved ones, financial hardship, ect, ect.. If I’m feeling this awful now when I’m not dealing with most of this, how the fuck will I cope in later life when the going actually gets tough, and isn’t all in my broken brain? 

Suicide sounds like the best option right now. All of this just ending, the anxiety, the pure dread and fucking sadness that owns my life just going away forever is a lovely thought. 

However, I couldn’t dare do that to my family or the other couple of people in my life who would mourn me. The pain I’d pass on, the blaming of themselves for not knowing what I was going through or feeling that they didn’t do enough, there’s no way man.

So I guess that’s it then. Stuck here, in this body, with this fucked up mind, this disgusting shell of a person. I never asked to be alive man. Fuck this."
Went to a Psychiatrist today,2,mkzdg6,3,"I'm 58 and have lost many jobs over the years. I fear I will lose my current teaching job because of my lack of classroom management skills and anger that arises from the worst of student behaviors. There are lots of current stressors and childhood trauma that followed me into adulthood because of my father's alcoholism and depth into his own depression.

I didn't want to pay the $200 but I'm glad i went today. He adjusted my meds (Venlafaxine 225mg), and assured me that I wasn't narcissistic and that I shouldn't pursue disability, among other things. Maybe he can work through some situations with me that will help me with my anger. He did agree that students are very difficult these days, but there's a lot of stress for them and their family.

Just my two cents. I'm fortunate I can pay the fees."
I'm a failure. And I'm tired of doing anything to change it.,8,mkpifn,1,"I tried. Many times. I'm tired. I tried to do my best. At my job
Or making art. Or keeping meaningful connections w others. I feel useless, weak and stupid. I loved my job - my boss decided it's not important and i was moved to another position. Which i hated. Nevertheless I worked hard. I was considered one of the best employees. Eventually burnt out to the point of mental breakdown. I tried to find myself somewhere outside an office job. Worked as a photographer for a magazine - hardly can earn enough to eat and pay bills. Also, I've been drawing stuff for several years alongside working my regular job. Ppl constantly told me to monetize my art. I tried. Again and again. And i failed. Again and again. Well, i hate digital art, also I don't draw furries or whatever. I always dreamt of illustrating children's books. I tried to contact many publishers and authors - they either ghosted me or responded smth like we'll call you if we need you. I feel desperate. Currently im financially depend on my boyfriend and he's ok with that, also my brother helps me with money, but this is so embarrassing. Im 30. No kids to feed at least. Instead, depression, social anxiety, schizotypal + bipolar 2. Sometimes I can't make myself leave the house. Talk to someone, even to my mom. Thinking abt working with ppl and around ppl scares the shit out of me. I can't imagine doing back to the office. Or at least at a job interview. I'm so tired. I feel useless. Embarrassed. Lost.

Losing weight too fast.,2,mkz6lz,0,"Its been such a struggle to eat lately. It really sucks. I try to work out 6 days a week, but I don't think it's doing much.

A rant/ need some encouragement,4,mkuh1p,4,"On a throwaway 
I stopped seeing my psychiatrist (he is actually a PA under a paychiatrist) when covid started bc I had huge amounts of anxiety about teletherapy. I actually just ignored my appointment even though they called me and ignored the calls because I was so anxious. I also stopped taking my medication (lexapro) 
I know it sounds ridiculous but I’m scared to go back and ask for help. I’ve been really struggling but I’m scared he’s going to be mad at me because I stopped medication in the past and made me promise not to do it again bc it is dangerous. I’m at the point where I dont know if I can go back or if I should just fine a different psychiatrist. Another concern of mine is he  encouraged me and gave me a lot of advice about taking organic chemistry in college and going into medicine. I ended up getting Cs in orgo I and II and I feel like I just dont want to talk about school with him. I dont know what to do b bc I feel like it would be better to go back to someone I am familiar with but I am terrified and I’m on the verge of tears about this.




This is a side note/ extra rant but I am also in a new relationship and when I got into it I wasn’t really struggling and didn’t want to mention my depression and now I dont really know how to talk about it with him and I’m scared bc I really care about him and dont want to be a burden on him and I’m also scared he won’t understand. I’m also scared to lose him bc I just dont feel as connected to him and I feel very anxious but again I think this is a mental health issue. I also feel so dumb bc I am a junior and I feel like I’m not at all prepared to graduate college since my grades suffered and I didn’t get involved partially bc of mental health probably although I keep thinking it was laziness it’s hard to tell them apart"

I can’t feel anything,4,mkubl5,4,"All I had was games and anime but now even those things(as pitiful as it sounds) no longer elicit any emotional response from me...I feel like I should be sad, that I should just end my life now that I can’t even afford to escape my thoughts. But I feel nothing..it was all I had since I let everything else go to shit, I didn’t care as long as I could escape...I see now my nihilistic views are no longer after thoughts but in fact truth and I can’t bring myself to do anything else but live not to die...funny I have no reason to live but I still insist on living a meaningless life regardless...I keep going back hoping they’ll be something there..it’s like I’m a zombie, I live without reason driven by instinct and faded memories of a version of myself that no longer even exists..even interacting w family feels so alien...I don’t have the will to lie anymore..I can’t even tell if I’m sorry..I don’t know how I feel all I can think about is letting go. But most unfortunate of all I know I’ll probably live this way until I die..I’ll pretend everything’s fine bc I’m too pussy to actually end my own life..it just doesn’t make sense to me, nothing does anymore..I wish it did hurt maybe then I could stop but there’s no point now..I wish could laugh it off accept shit and move on but I can’t even tell if those are lies..Idk anymore I give up"
"I have the perfect life, why am I depressed",4,mku6s4,3,"I’ve (24F) dealt with anxiety/depression my whole life, but wasn’t diagnosed until age 20. So for the past 4 years I’ve tried different meds and therapy, as well as trying different coping techniques such as exercise, journaling, etc. 

I have a bachelors degree, a full-time job, a truly loving husband, a house that we own, and two sweet baby angel dogs. What more could a person ask for? Especially after the last year so many people were sick/dying, losing loved ones, losing jobs, and here I am, sitting in my perfect little life still so utterly and completely depressed. While everyone else was suffering during 2020, I got married, purchased my first home, got a raise at my job, and got a second dog.

I feel like such a piece of shit, I hate myself so much. I wake up every morning and wish that I hadn’t. My husband does everything he knows how to try and make me feel better, but nothing works. I feel like such an ungrateful bitch."
I give up...,2,mkyv2a,2,"Ain’t even got the energy to type. I just don’t see the point anymore. Everyone around me is moving forward and I’m just in the same position as I was 4 years ago. 

Lockdown really has just increased this feeling. 

See ya folks."
"Do people really get over depression, or will I just live with it till I die?",2,mkyuun,11,"Long story short I made a plan to end my life after my parents pass to save them the grief. Obviously this is assuming that I still feel the same way when I'm 30-50, but seeing how my feelings haven't changed the past 7 years, will I ever not wanna kill myself?

Someone told me on here aswell that depression never leaves you just have to face it, that kinda sucks ass? I mean I use videk games, youtube, anime and whatnot to help distract myself but, will I have to do that everyday basically till I die? If thats the truth, I salute you people who are over the age of 25 and still have the will to go on."
Why Does It Feel I'm Never 'Lucky' Enough to Die?,2,mkys19,0,"Well, you probably know how this goes, since I'm posting here rather than on Ask Reddit or some other more positive forum or community.

But regardless, I feel like I need somewhere to rant about life, my situation, and the feeling that it's completely hopeless right now, so here goes.

Basically, I've been depressed for what feels like months at this point, and the pandemic has only made it worse by giving me near endless time to think about my life and situation. Every day is the same, and everything just feels more and more hopeless every time.

A large part of the reason for this is twofold. I feel like I always end up struggling alone in everything, unable to get help or fit in, and completely lack the emotional depth needed to really connect with other people.

In terms of the former, it's a case of being stuck alone every time. Every project I work on ends up being something I end up forced to do alone, without any help from others regardless of who I ask or when. Every personal problem has to be tackled alone, with no seeming way to communicate my feelings to anyone let alone get them to understand why I feel that way.

And even when people are seemingly supportive, the same applies. People will agree with me in private, but never in public (and tell the opposite story to anyone else to make themselves look good). I'll get endless amounts of praise for things I showcase online, yet no one will ever show the same sort of interest other such works get, in the sense of being willing to actually help out.

It's true of everything.  Having trouble at work? No one helps or offers to. Getting attacked on social media? Everyone stays quiet, even the people who tell me in private that they agree with what I'm saying. 

Exacerbating this is the sheer difficult I seem to have when it comes to making friends, or developing any real sort of connection with anyone else. I can talk to them, but it never feels that personal or friend like. Similarly, it feels like while I can participate in a community or group, I can never feel like part of it either. I'm just always stuck as the outsider, the lone individual unable to fit in anywhere.

It makes me wonder why I even exist. Why live when you can't connect to others and when you may as well live the life of a medieval hermit rather than a functional member of society.

But that's all just irrelevant background stuff. What really depresses me is the feeling that I can't just be... 'lucky' enough for it to end. I can't just have some illness or accident finally end things for me, in a way that seems perfectly normal and natural.

Like I would love to just have a few weeks to live or not survive after an unfortunate event occurred. It'd provide some sort of closure, and take responsibility away.

Yet it never happens. It feels like that only happens for those who have something to live for, who matter on this planet and who'd be missed by others. The stories are always of some hopeful with a long happy life ahead of them dying tragically, never some miserable soul getting the rest they actually want.

Is the universe not letting it happen because it wouldn't be tragic enough? Am I being kept here because it's 'fun' to watch the struggles continue week after week, month after month?

It makes me look back at the near misses (like the time I was hit by a car and just walked it off), and wonder why it couldn't have just gone the other way.

But yeah, that's just how I keep feeling at the moment. Sorry for ranting too much, and I hope everyone else has had a good day at least."
"My job is easy enough, why am I struggling so much with it??",3,mkw2ya,1,"I feel pathetic. At work my main task is doing clerical work, mostly doing a lot of calling people and making appointments. I feel stupid even complaining about it, but I end up crying every day over it. I sit at my desk and I can’t get my brain to work, I seriously can’t get anything done. I don’t know what it is.. I really don’t like the job, but I just need to suck it up, right? I am so anxious and sad all the time. I can’t even get motivated to do things that are enjoyable, so I can hardly do this job . I feel so dumb and useless. I’m not where I want to be in life. I don’t want to be a baby about it, I just feel like a failure. I feel miserable."
I dont know what to do,3,mkvzgo,0,"My bf broke up with me after a year of being in the relationship. The first reason was that I was too much to handle, then it became to us not having a future, then it became to him not wanting to depend on a relationship for his happiness. I have been shaking for 3 days now and haven’t eaten today, I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel the constant need to blame myself and I want to hurt myself but I promised him i wont. I don’t know what to do, im so attached to him. I can’t stop crying every night and i have nobody else to talk to because my bestfriend is always busy. I want to go to therapy but i don’t have that type of money. I can’t stop having panic attacks and I cant get out of bed. I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel like I lost everything"
Do the majority of people that are compliant with antidepressants actually see success? Just doesn't seem accurate.,3,mkvz09,1," I ended up befriending other kids that were also abused in school, so I may just be seeing the worst of it. But out of all of us, only a few got their shit together correctly now in our 30s. And I bet even they still have a lot they're hiding from people, they're just doing it rather well.            
         
 The rest of us? Fucked. Even the ones that showed self control in life assuming things would work out, including me, ended up with problems. Mine and about 20% of others are more physical than mental. Majority are mental but no meds are working for any of us. So many of us are addicts, homeless, in prison, or dead.     
         
We rarely see anyone turn their lives around on medications, and if they do it's very short lived.            
             
I look at statistics and supposedly 60%ish of people respond well to antidepressants but that is not what I'm seeing.      

Then again my own doctors are almost always in denial about the side effects I report to them. I have to find out from others that they have similar problems with doctors. Just me saying that the meds are helping me sleep but making my original problems worse is still success to them?         

Things just don't seem to be adding up."
"i’m going to be completely frank, i probably won’t make it to the end of the year",12,mkmfcs,9,"i’ve tried everything, therapy doesn’t work, talking to friends and family doesn’t help, the harmful stuff (which i won’t get into) makes me feel worse in the long run. i just feel so lost. but i don’t want to commit suicide, i just don’t want to be alive anymore."
i can't sleep but not because of my insomnia,2,mkyb5x,0,"these last days are a nightmare to me, my best friend is suicidal and i feel very very bad for her.

I'm stressed and as a result, i don't eat much,it's becoming very hard. i'm also very anxious. i don't know what to do at this point, i need help.

she doesn't respond since 10:14 pm and it's 1:44 am right now

i hope she didn't do it but at the same time she's living with a friend since a week because we don't know what she can do so she must have done nothing

Heartbroken and Depressed,2,mky8ed,4,"I've (24M) dealt with depression for most of my life. Mental health issues run in the family. I currently go to therapy but am unmedicated. 

I've also been going through the worst heartbreak of my life. My 4 year relationship ended officially a few months ago after a year-long back and forth breakup. It broke me. I'm the most depressed I've ever been, feeling so hopeless. I was completely in love with him. We lived together, did so many things together. He opened my world to so many experiences and people that I never would've experienced without him. I've been feeling this loss for quite a few months now. Unfortunately I don't have much of a support system. I live at home and unemployed and am quite friendless. I have one close friend but he lives quite far away now and he deals with his own mental health issues.   
The worst part is the day-to-day. I don't have much at all to distract myself or anyone to be around to help me heal from this. Even if I get an opportunity to do something, I'm too depressed to do it. So i mostly just sit on my bed and cry all day. I've tried taking up working out at home to help release endorphins but i find it hard to get the motivation.   
He was the best thing I ever had in my life - he made me want to live it. But I lost him and I'm trying to find myself again. Just sucks when you don't have much to do to distract yourself from the pain. I cry a lot. More than I ever did before.

I've considered going on SSRIs again to help me improve my mood, but my last experience on them was a bit traumatizing. My first dose of Zoloft and I had a full blown panic attack. Ended up in the ER because I had no idea what was happening to me. Stopped immediately but it took a long while for the panicky feelings to subside. I tried Prozac a little while after but stopped after 3 days because I was scared of the panic attacks happening again. It sucks that a side effect of SSRIs is increased anxiety. I already have enough anxiousness, I don't need more. Especially from the meds that are supposed to help.   


I just wish the pain would stop. I've been depressed for so long. I hate it. I want to enjoy my life and I want to live it. Experience everything. The good and the bad. But without the depression. It's exhausting and overwhelming."
"So, I did it.",2,mky5l4,0,"See my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/m2y3k5/thinking_of_telling_my_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). So, despite a lack of responses there, I went ahead and sent out the following text via a restricted Facebook post:

""This is not one of those “If YoU cAn ReAd ThIs” copypastas. I wrote this myself, and if you are able to see it, I would appreciate if you would read it. This is not me seeking affirmation or pity. It is me trying to explain what is going on in my head and how it expresses itself outwardly, the best way I can, in a setting I can control.

I have been struggling, mostly in silence, with thoughts and feelings I cannot control. Not just recently, but for years now. I have kept quiet mostly to protect my own stupid pride, which I came to realize is ridiculous. For the most part, my life is nearly perfect, and I should be over the moon for how well things have finally turned out for me. Yet, I occasionally have overwhelming feelings of irritability, sadness, anxiety, fear, inadequacy, self-loathing, and a few others I can’t name. Despite this, I still like to think of myself as a generally happy person who is truly blessed.
  
There are days when I completely shut down mentally and emotionally. Like someone flipped a breaker in my brain, and I (either suddenly or gradually) lose all interest in interacting with any and all other humans. This is particularly painful for me when Brittany or the kids want to tell me about their day, share something they learned, or celebrate an achievement. Beyond that, when there is something happening (a birthday, milestone, etc. external to our household) which I should be excited about. But I’m completely tuned out. Seriously, it hurts, y’all.

Some of you know I have abandonment issues, which thanks to many of you, I have largely overcome. Yet, thoughts linger, which cause complex emotions I can’t begin to describe. I often fear that I am not enough, for any of you. That I’m not living up to expectations. That mistakes I have made in the past (both distant and recent) still dictate my future. Things which I should be able to shrug off and move on from, hang over me like a cartoon thundercloud. Just so we’re clear, this is NOT due to anything that any of you have said or done.

I have been medicated in the past. Do I need to be again? I don’t know. I have had my hormone levels checked, and some are outside of what’s considered normal. And those which are have been attributed to altered emotional states. I’m not ashamed to admit that I’ve broken out in ugly sobbing fits for absolutely no reason. I’ve considered therapy, but past experiences have left me quite jaded. But, I may have to put my reservations aside and place my trust in a professional once again to figure this out. Please keep in mind that while this may very well be depression, I am NOT suicidal. I know I have far too much to live for, and frankly, death terrifies me.
   
I have also not been intentionally evasive or rude or disrespectful. If you have taken my actions as such, let me reiterate that some of my actions are dictated by thoughts and emotions I CANNOT control. Communication is one of my worst weaknesses, I don’t call ANYONE nearly as often as I should, and conversation is usually sparse when I do. The lack of contact then compounds the guilt I feel and perpetuates a spiral, causing anxiety about initiating contact after long periods. My social media activity has also drastically declined, and for additional unrelated reasons as well.
  
For the sake of understanding, I should tell you that figuring out how to say this has taken several months. It is being posted here because there is no way I would be able to say this to any of you in person, or over the phone. I have prayed that the words would come, that I could share my quiet pain with you, my family. For your benefit as much as mine.
   
I don’t expect everyone to understand (or even believe) everything I’m saying. And that’s fine, this is solely for me to get this out in the open for those who need to hear it the most. Some of this was very easy to write, while the rest was equally daunting. I changed the visibility settings to allow only those whom I wished to see this, as tagging allows you and everyone you know to see. So please, let others know about this, and if they can’t see it, I’m not comfortable with them knowing about this yet.
  
This has been a long read, and if you’ve made it through, I want to thank you. Thank you also for your love, for your support, for your encouragement over the years. I want you to know that I love you very much, and I’m sorry if my actions (or inactions) have hurt you or damaged my relationship with you. As difficult as this has been to express, I wanted you all to know that I am working on it.""

I got a few very supportive responses, but the ones I really needed to hear, from the people causing my anxiety, were largely quiet. Maybe I screwed up by doing this, but now that I finally had the words, I felt the time was right."
I struggle with feeling valid about my depression because I can still get out of bed.,1,ml2f0m,0,"My therapist has described my depression as rolling and steady. So there are lows but most of the time I am just kind of floating by. 

I can’t remember the last time I felt really happy. Which is so hard for me. I was the super excitable, hyper, fun person growing up. But now at 26 I am just so meh.

I don’t feel overwhelming sadness all the time but I also don’t feel much of anything. I feel like the only emotion that is consistent in my life is anger... I just want to be happy. I want to feel physically happy.

I hate that it is so hard to talk about this version of depression because I don’t look depressed. I can go to work and do my baseline life tasks but I am just so tired. I feel so invalid.

I just want to be happy and hyper. I want to stop breaking my fiancé’s heart because I don’t get excited for things and have been having a hard time connecting with them. 

I just want to feel something and get rid of the apathy.

Does it get better? I was prescribed Prozac, but I am just so nervous to take them. I have had them for 4 months now and took one but never took any after."
Depression and brain fog,10,mkmhow,1,"For a long time, I have fought against this persistent feeling that I wasn't real and lived in thick, deep fog. I felt like my memory was not as good as it should be, and my ability to function in life was deeply affected.

Yes, I am able to function on an average level. I was able to get my master's degree and am doing ""ok"". But the entire time I did it, it has been a struggle. 


One time I **lost** my car in a small city because I forgot where I parked. I had to walk and weave between blocks to find my vehicle because I had no fucking idea. I had devised a system to know where I parked, by screenshotting my location on Google Maps. At the time though, my GPS was off, and I screenshotted the wrong location. Oops. This is no longer a problem though because I moved. 


I have labels in my room on shelves that say ""deoderant"", ""glasses"", ""wallet"" like someone with significant impairment. I have a label on my one of my plant's which tells me the maximum volume I can turn up my Amazon Alexa and not bother my roommates. It's volume number 3 by the way, lol. That really did help. 


I forget that I tell stories and my ex didn't tell me. I kind of resent him for not being honest with me about it, but now I am more concious about it. I forget details about people that are important, but I am much better at it now. I actually became a couple and family therapist, so my memory has been forced to improve in that area. 


In my deepest times, I will forget to eat, shower, brush my teeth. It's not that I don't want to do them, it's that I don't even think of it. It doesn't even register that these things are important. Then when I come out of this fog, I am horrified at the things I have been neglecting and need to recover. Then by the time I recover, I fall back in.

This pandemic has saved my life because I have been able to work on myself and my needs. I was able to do transcranial magnetic stimulation and it changed everything for me. Absolutely everything.  But I wanted to share my story with brain fog and let you know you're not alone with it. This shit sucks, and it's something I just try to cope with. There are a lot of strategies for it, it just takes some time and experimenting with solutions.

Apologize for the wall of text. 


TLDR: Brain fog can impair your life significantly, but there are strategies you can do to overcome it. Think of it like a puzzle or game to solve and you can do it. Do it without shame, it's your house and fuck others who judge."
My friends shame my disorder,1,ml2bvk,1,"I don't think they always realize it, but they give me a lot of crap for my mood. 
For background, I've had depressive symptoms for a good amount of years. For as long as I can remember, I've been abnormally tired, a lack of an appetite, felt sad most of the time, and have been the first to focus on the negative aspects of life, despite me efforts not to. Although I denied my condition for years, out of fear of being weak, My doctor diagnosed me dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder).
I don't usually bring it up to anyone, but a lot of my friends definitely know of this. I try to stay on top of it, but a lot of times it gets the best of me. Whenever this happens my friends tend to make fun of or criticize my mood, either calling me grumpy,  complaining about how im always tired, or making me feel bad for not being energetic with them. 
I always try my best to be the funny energetic me, but it's so hard and exausting. I always feel the need to keep the facade of being ok, and just pass it off as staying up too late (which I rarely do).

I never feel like I can truely express myself. When in mental turmoil I feel as though I have no where to go. I've cried alone for so long that no it's hard for me to do so, like my body ran out of tears.
I've had so many friends who have said it's okay to express my emotions, and to let it all out, but whenever Ive done so, usually the response is something along the lines of ""toughen up"", or ""be a man"". They say this as I feel all I ever do is ""toughen up"". I look myself in the eye every morning and tell myself to just pull it together.
Even my past girlfriends, who tried to support me, events just complained about my negative mind set.

Sometimes I feel like I just bring down the energy of the group. When my depression is bad, I just feel this odd disassociation from life, and it's hard to fully interact with my friends. 

Depression also manifests in agitation, which also gets made fun of by my friends. 

I try to defend myself at times, and they just struggle to say sorry through their laugh.

"I failed at my dream, have nothing to show for it, and I’m being pushed out. Again. At what point does one just quit life?",1,ml25w5,3,"Hey all. Reddit is the only social network I have any more, and I really don’t have any expectations. I guess I’m just looking for an answer instead of the black void of eventuality I’m facing right now. 

People say “just find something you’re good at” and “be yourself” as if these are two things that grant automatic acceptance in life. Well not for me, and if you’re reading this, maybe not for you too. 

How do people function? What’s it like to not feel under the weight of life and only knowing how it feels to fail under the pressure? Seriously, how can people not feel like this? It’s all I can remember feeling, and I just don’t want to feel anything any more. 

My family pushed me out because I wasn’t what they wanted. I literally went out the window as a teenager, and never went back. I’ve been pushed out of any group I’ve joined since then: high school, college, jobs, college again, jobs again. Eventually, they all tire of me and want me to go. At first, things can go right, but eventually, inevitably, unerringly - I am made to leave.

How am I supposed to learn and accept who I am, when the thought and reality of who I am is so consistently unacceptable. 

I came halfway around the world to a place where everyone, even the rejects and outsiders can go, and find a sense of community and acceptance. Instead, it’s full of hustlers, and doers, and wannabe-ers. I remember how that felt. But on the other side of a decade of being here with a few aquaintances to show for it, and facing the fact that I should leave has just left me feeling a whole lot of “what’s the point?”ism

It’s not that I want to die or go out with a bang or anything that dramatic. I just want to stop existing. To stop hurting. To stop being rejected. To just make everything stop. 

I have spent a decade where I am and I have nothing to show for it. I have the same lack of funds I came with, I’m in the same entry level I came in. 

People aren’t allowed to just exist here. Or anywhere really. They have to do something, or make something, or become something. I have done none of those things, and I am left staring down a decade of paths not taken or tried, of things tried and failed, of failure upon failure with nothing to retreat to but the my tears and the fetal position in my shower.

I’m a grown ass adult and I feel like a spoiled, useless child who has no one to blame but myself, nowhere to go, and no hope left. Nothing left. 

Everything points to failure and despair. I have taken hits before and found the strength to keep going somehow. I had always found something in me that would keep me going. The believe that I could be something, that I could become something, if I could just make it and get that chance. 

Well, I came here and I got that chance and I squandered it. I got it again, and squandered again. A third time, and squandered again. And now, I know there’s no point in trying. I am a broken person. The pieces left no longer make a whole and I do not know the way back, and I cannot find the energy to care. I can only find the inclination to withdraw into a basement somewhere and die. Hardly anyone would notice, and the ones that might, would recover soon enough.

I have nowhere to be, nowhere to go, and nothing left. 

I am done. Can please someone show mercy and turn out this dim, dwindling, pathetic light?"
"How do people dealing with depression even manage to find lasting relationships, platonically or romantically?",2,mkxulr,1,"I just can't, on the romantic side, I can't look at myself and think ""Yeah, I guess I wouldn't be a bad partner"" when I quite literally lack in the personality and looks department, moreover, sometimes I feel so awful that I start talking about my issues and that is, by all accounts, a red flag and it's when people usually stop talking to me. 

&#x200B;

Likewise, with friends, I feel that I simply have no energy to reply to them most of the times, sometimes I don't even want to talk to anyone, and yet I keep wishing someone would talk to me, which makes it an awful, awful contradiction that I just can't work out. And when I do manage to talk to someone, randomly I will start talking about my problems(See the pattern?) and I HATE when I do that, but truth is, that's all the content I have, I got no passions, no dreams, no hobbies, I just exist, so yeah brain, why do you want to talk to people, when you know I am as boring as they come?"
I don't know how to get people to notice.,3,mkurme,3,"In 2014, I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD.

This past year has been extremely difficult and I have been suicidal and have self harmed for the first time ever. My only daily contact is with my direct family (I moved back home after I graduated), my coworkers (I work at a small local restaurant), and my boyfriend. I am not actively telling people about my depression and how low I feel, one could even say that I am actively trying to hide it since if I were to really say how I felt, I would be complaining all the time. Yet at the same time, I wish people noticed. My friends from college do not reach out to me. In college, I didn't have a friend group. I had friends within different circles, but I was not contained to one. I wish now that I had found a group, but at the time, I was focused mostly on my health and prioritized that over collegiate opportunities and experiences. I recognize that it isn't healthy to have my boyfriend as my only friend, and I know that he is not trying to make that the case (I think our relationship is very healthy in fact). But the pressure I'm subconsciously putting on him to be my boyfriend and my only friend is causing me to think that our relationship isn't working either (which I know isn't true!). I am not active on social media like I used to be, I am not actively texting in group chats like I once was, and yet, I don't have anyone reaching out to me asking if I am doing ok. I will receive the occasional ""miss you"" text from a friend here and there. But it's all surface level. How do I get the people who used to be in my life to care and reach out to me? Am I being selfish for wanting them to reach out to me first? Do I have to promote my sadness to get my friends to notice me? I am so lonely."
Someone to talk to,43,mkejt0,14,"Hi. I'm 19. In the span of 4 years I've lost 4 friends, one died in a car wreck, 1 committed suicide, and the other 2 got shot. My dog had to be put down on February 11th of this year. I'm A positive person for others, but for myself, I want to die. I don't want to talk to my friends about it, I'd feel more comfortable with someone I dont know comforting me (its weird ik) I'm losing my grip on my life and I just need someone to help before I do something bad to myself."

No, actually a lot of people likes me. But not like I want to. I need more.

Bath + microwave. A bottle of whisky. And I send my suicides notes to people to explain.

Why am I like this ?

Fuck, I only have 2 days left to prepare my next year.

One month of quarantine. It's going to be hell.

I can't even see the few people who seems to have a little interest in me.

My work is canceled. Fuck. I have nothing to do until summer.

Shot me.

Sorry mom, I know I done nothing today.

Why I have no will to live ?

If I'm attractive. Nice. Why do I have to put so much efforts into my relationships ?

I'm feeling so fucking lonely.

Fucking headache. I really need to sleep damn it.

I hate you mom.

I love you mom.

Why I can't die ? Why is it bad ?

I need meds. A ton of meds.

Ho gosh I fucking hate being alive.

Why am I feeling so empty ?

I need to stop to talk to people, I need to act like a real asshole. People will let me down. And I will finally be free.

Nope I can't.

Why I still have romantic feelings for people who only want to be my friends ? Why am so pathetic ?

I want to cut. But I hate washing the blood.

Shut up. All of you. You know nothing about my day. You have no idea of how it is in my head.

Fuck parents.

Fuck life.

Let me go. Stop crying when I talk about it. Stop caring about me.

And stop telling me to stay alive for you. Stop telling me you need me when you talk to me only once in 3 weeks.

fuck therapist. Useless.

Life should be a choice."
How do I help a friend who is too depressed to accept any offers for help?,1,ml1oyt,4,"A good friend of mine is struggling with a bout of depression (he was already going through a rough time, then unexpectedly lost someone close to him to COVID on top of it). I do what I can to help him out but he's so depressed that my offers of help get greeted with a ""thanks, that means a lot"", then never get mentioned again. 

I'm genuinely not sure if my continued check-ins, offers to help out in specific ways, or invitations to hang out are helping at all or serving more as reminders that he doesn't have the energy to do things that he would want to do. Does anyone have some advice on how to be a support friend here? I'd appreciate it."
I have this sinking feeling more and more.,1,ml1nr4,0,"I felt this Fear and Anger when I started doing a study course VA, my Mom bought this study course from her friend who is also VA, and tutored a lot of people to succeed. I'm sorry this story is going to be long and English is not my first language.

Some backstory, I used to work in BPO as a Customer Support, VA, and Editor in nightshift; I'll be honest I do not want to return to that living, and working in Sales makes me Anxious even though I graduated in Marketing. At home, I practice and hone my skills in Digital Art and Cooking because it is one of the few things where I can be creative and I feel joy doing so. During the time I was Jobless I was always getting pressured to go home every lunch to check up on my Grandfather who is suffering from dementia and this life stayed for years and I developed first signs of Anxiety and Anger Issues (We have no Therapists and if they are they're not supported), this resulted in me having a hard time finding a job since I cannot stay at offices since no one is at home to feed him food or water so I became his nurse. I tried freelancing at home but most clients I meet tend to screw me over for ""Exposure"". 

During the Pandemic my Grandfather's condition worsened and he recently died last month (I'm at the age of 26 and I'm a dude being his nurse) due to his Old Age and now I'm trying to find new clients and trying Streaming (Without showing my face ofc) on Video Games and Art. Oftentimes, my Mom (Most of the time) or my Sister pressure me to find a real job or start a Business with them. Now, my Mom is a brilliant woman who has worked for the Govt. and helping our little city with the economic problem during the pandemic and she is getting close to retirement which I can understand why she wants me to go take a real job, take the Civil Service Exam to become a Govt. Worker or start a Business but she never tried to start her own business in her life, there were attempts but it always involves me working alone and doing everything alone with no one to help me around to jumpstart her plans while my Sister has friends to help her boutique business.

This brings us to recent events, My Mom recently been pressuring me to take this VA Course for Amazon VA because her friend has so made a lot of people successful by turning them into Amazon VAs and I'll be honest it sounds great but I'm not interested going back as a VA anymore since I'm done with that life. She insisted me so much to take the course because it feels ""wasteful"" if I don't take the opportunity and in my heart, I felt Anger, Frustration, and Pity in my head because she was saying I am not going anywhere with Streaming Video Games and managing my Digital Art Page even though I enjoyed doing it because I know what she is saying is true because I'm new to the world of Streaming and I have a hard time finding good clients even though I've helped a Streamer grow her audience outside and even hosted in some local tournaments I'm not getting anywhere closer to the goal I wanted because I'm new to it and now she wants me to jump ship and switch to VA since she is paying for the course (It is not the most expensive course but still costs quite a hefty amount of Money) I felt pity and took the course so that she would be pleased and just stop talking behind my back for being ungrateful and for achieving nothing. 

Now, I am the second week of the course, and every time I look at these notes, My heart just feels sinking faster and anger/sadness rises but I have to keep my composure to keep myself from lashing out and saying things that I would regret towards my Mom and my sister because I love them with all my heart but I feel like the worst is about to come and I have to keep this fake attitude so I just have to keep my mouth shut. I woke up this morning now something wants to drag me and my head keeps making these alternate scenarios where I screw up again and again as the weekend classes get closer. My plan is just to push through these classes just for the month and hopefully, it'll be over soon so that I can move on. I know I feel like an un-opportunistic/ungrateful person but I just feel sinking in quicksand the more I think about it and I feel it is getting deeper now.

Sorry for the long post."
i never thought it would get this low,5,mkqpds,0,"a few weeks ago i was hospitalized and put on new meds and they’re not working that great. i feel like at this point my brain is immune to antidepressants. my life is so incredibly boring and mundane but at the same time i get over-stimulated super fast and can’t deal with stress. 
i’ve been thinking about trying drugs for the first time just to feel something other than numbness, except i’m broke and don’t know where to find dealers. 
i’m so sick of living it’s gotten to a point where i feel like fuck it all. i don’t have a purpose in life and feel like human waste and i’m just waiting to die so i can travel to a new planet."
"Im 19, balding and I hate it",9,mkll9z,5,"I'm a 19 year old Psychology student (the irony) and I'm severely balding. I always get weird looks wherever I go especially in our university, I exist in a society where your hair is something that ""completes your look"" and having a balding head among an ocean of clean fades and trendy haircuts sticks out like a sore thumb, I hate how people looked at me different but I can't blame them, I also hate how some of them felt the need to point out my head when I was the one who notices it the most, every gust of wind that might show my scalp, trying not to sweat in a tropical climate and wearing a cap wherever I go. We've been having online classes since the pandemic began and it has given me the chance to see what I look like shaven and I absolutely hate it, the only thing that I've got going for me is my physique, I'm short and could not grow a beard to save my life, I have a weak jawline and my head shape is whack. Heck, even some of my closest friends couldn't help but laugh when I facetimed them. The pandemic is finally getting better thanks to vaccines (which I'm glad about) but I don't know how I'm gonna be able to face my classmates and professors when our university finally opens up again. I don't want to be looked at with disgust and I don't want anyone to see me with my girlfriend because it may be a bad look for her. this sucks.

I am so so sorry for venting here but this is something that I could not say to anyone else. My family is composed of doctors who are busy fighting Covid right now and I wouldn't want to bug them and I'm afraid that most of my closest friends wouldn't understand, I posted this here in hopes of finding someone who has gone through something like this and I would really like to know how you managed to do it. Again, I'm so sorry for venting here but I felt that I needed this, thank you."

Depression is swallowing me whole as of late (some triggers),1,ml1gwg,0,"
I’m currently (20F) struggling with depression in the midst of being separated from my family.
In the next coming months my mom will be moving to a different state with my older brother, and I’ll be staying in my home state but living with my dad who I haven’t lived with in 10 years. Long story short, dad won custody of us when they first divorced when I was about 4 or 5 because he knows many people in the court system of that city (he was a cop, has many connections), my mom spent years trying to get us back and did when I was around 10. My mom has always been my primary care giver and confidant, and I feel like I won’t be able to survive without her around.  I have no bond with my dad, he didn’t give us a great childhood (alcoholism, etc) and now I feel as If I’m being put right back from where my mom fought so hard to get me out of. It’s dawned of me that I probably have some abandonment issues, and I have always had a severe attachment to my mom. It feels like I’m being abandoned, but I’m old enough now where I feel like these feelings are immature and I shouldn’t be having them. This is the age where people go to college and get away from their families so I feel like I should be handling this a lot better. For reference I’m a junior, almost a senior and college, and when I was living on campus I always went home on weekends.

I have a great boyfriend, and great friends that I’ll be closer to distance wise once I go back living at my dad’s. However I still feel extremely alone. As a teenager I battled pretty bad depression, and I feel defeated with it being back. I’m at a point in life where I have many things most people would want, and yet I’m constantly  feeling terrible, having thoughts of suicide, and I’m tempted to resort back to self harm. I’m not sure how to come out of this. I’ve explained pretty vaguely to my mom about how I feel about everything and her reassurance just isn’t enough. 

I feel like she doesn’t understand because she’s not the one being left behind. 

Am I being dramatic? Are my feelings understandable? How do I win this battle with yet another round of depression and suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harm?

If anyone has been in a similar situation I’d appreciate any advice on how to handle this, and how to gain back some control and not let my depression completely swallow me whole.

Thank you."
What to do when you feel a depressive episode coming on?,5,mkp3dk,3,"I've been okay since a particularly bad bout of depression in February, but I can almost feel another depressive episode coming on again.

You stop feeling the cuts at some point,1,ml12w1,0,"I accidentally stabbed my hand while cooking dinner today and felt nothing. The blood was pouring onto the counter and floor but I just looked at it as if it was a tiny scratch. I sound emo as hell typing this, but it truly amazes me. 

I guess it's not to hard to understand how people like me can like the feeling, too. The only actual feeling I get from it was a head numbing dizzyness, which is so nice. For that moment of ecstasy everything feels nice. 

Yesterday, at work, I decided to cut myself too. They put me on self check out alone, while also making me fill the machine with money, which takes an excruciating long time. Though I still had to tend to customers and run around with this money in hand in a tiny bowl. To no ones surprise, I dropped it. Thankfully I was able to pick each coin up, but god was that time spent on the floor so humiliting and embarrassing. No matter what I tried to do to calm myself after words didn't work, so I decided to just take my knife out in my car and slice my side.

Efexor XR withdrawal,1,ml0yg2,2,"Also known as venlafaxine, venlablue and venlalic as well as many others.

I started taking this about 7/8 years ago. At first it really helped me. I didn't get any initial side effects. 

I've been trying to come off of it for at least three years due to the absolutely horrific side effects when I go into withdrawal. They present themselves within a day. Alternate days and fast tapering don't work.

I have sleep paralysis, extreme disassociation, vomiting, shaking, uncontrollable crying. I only remember some of these instances. My partner tells me the rest. I couldn't get my meds for three days once and don't remember it. Withdrawal from this drug is terrifying.

I'd like to hear other experiences with this medication.

I know that some people don't have that bad a time with withdrawal from this. I'd like to hear from people that have had experiences like me.

online school is taking so fucking much out of me. ive struggled with my depression for a long time now, having it since i was eleven years old (im 16 now,) but being online for highschool is just making it so much worse. i'm a good student, i have a 4.0 gpa and im an active member or multiple clubs, even leading my own. to my teachers, i probably look like i'm doing great, but on the inside i feel like i'm about to crumble. i can't do any of my assignments without feeling like i'm going to have a fucking stroke from all of the stress. just doing basic shit in class, like paying attention for the whole period, brushing my teeth before class, getting dressed and paying attention take *everything* out of me. on a good day, i wake up 20 or so minutes before class and maybe wash up a bit, and then go to class on my phone, not paying much attention. on a bad one, i miss multiple periods because i accidentally slept in and i feel like shit about myself for the rest of the day. 

the state of my attitude towards school is making me so angry. i used to be a student who was excited to learn and to do my best, but now school is just about maintaining my stupid fucking grades. i feel like i'm going insane. 

the reason that im spiraling right now is because there's an essay that i'm supposed to be writing that i just can't, for the fucking life of me, seem to get fucking finished. it's making me so angry and depressed because English is the subject that comes easiest to me and the one that i ace all of the time. now, i just can't seem to do anything. 

&#x200B;

aside from school, my fucking body image has been horrible lately. i'm an athlete that plays competitively, and i want to play D1 one of these days. so many of the girls on my team, girls i follow who play my sport on Instagram and just people on Instagram have perfect bodies. i know that you shouldn't compare people's bodies online to your own, but i'm a teenager and i can't really help it. i got rid of tiktok and Instagram, two apps that were really making it bad, but i still can't escape these thoughts. i just hate my body. i wish i was skinnier and i wish i had a flat stomach. when i look into the mirror i always think, ""there's a skinnier person in there that could get out if you weren't so lazy! get off your ass!"" 

  
it's really awful. there's also the fact that i'm an athlete that makes it worse. i'm pretty good at my sport, but i could be incredible if i worked harder and i know that. i could be a star if i just tried harder, but i'm just lazy and i feel like i can't get up and take the steps that there are to get there. i never want to do cardio. i don't want to do conditioning. i just lay in my bed, go on my computer, find ANY excuse not to do what i'm supposed to. i feel like im just letting myself down but i have no fucking clue how to fucking stop this cycle. i want out so badly.   


i don't have very many friends. i have 3 close ones. one of them lives across the country so i don't get to see them very often. the other one i don't go to school with but live near by. they've had depression, too, so they kinda know what it feels like, but i feel like i can never really have these conversations with them. they most they can say is ""sorry,"" which i understand and don't hold against them since not everyone handles venting and deep talks well. the same goes for my last friend. they're absolutely lovely and i'm so glad to have them in my life, but i would feel uncomfortable if i ever vented to them about my mental health because i honestly just don't want to be a burden to them. 

&#x200B;

i wonder a lot what my life would be like if i didn't have depression. how much more i would be able to get done. how much better my life would be. how i would be able to meet my potential. i wonder that so much as i lie around and do absolutely nothing. i just want to give up sometimes.

do you relate to anything i've said? does it make any type of sense? i don't know. thank you for reading and i hope you have a nice day."
Is there something in your life that is preventing you from progressing?,5,mkrbya,3,"For me I would say the fact that I watch porn, binge eat, play videogames all day is the reason why I'm so depressed.

How to Help My (15F) Friend (15M)?,3,mktfjk,1,"Hi dudes, I have this really great friend (I'll call him A) who is very sweet and talented but struggles a lot with depression. He's opened up a lot about it to me recently, and he's helped me with my own problems a lot in the past. We see each other at school, but our primary form of communication is through text since we don't get much time to talk to each other between classes. Anyways, I keep trying to empathize, but I feel like I say the wrong things, and I don't want to trivialize his problems. We have really good conversations, and I really wish I was able to help him in any way possible.

A has told me about how every day kind of feels like nothing and he can understand why people harm themselves just to feel something. We talked previously about suicide and death, and while he says he does experience suicidal thoughts, he's not actively suicidal and basically has a million reasons not to. He also told me that he is currently taking Zoloft, so I hope that helps.

Anyways, to be honest, I just really want to be a better friend, because he helps me a lot with my own issues and I feel like I don't reciprocate enough. What's the best course of action here?"
What’s love got to do with it,3,mktf6t,0,"I don’t expect anyone to respond with advice or words or anything at all but I think it would be nice to get it out. Also I’m 23F if that gives anything context. 

To make a long story short I honestly feel like I’m drowning in my emotions and no one around me can see I’m struggling and if they can they’re just watching. 

I have girlfriend and she has her issues and I’m always supportive, I’m always staying with her as she cries, or rants, she has adhd so finds it difficult to pay attention so sometimes it feels like I’m constantly fighting and forcing her to pay attention to me, but as soon as I say something or God forbid I have an attitude she gets all “woe is me, everybody hates me”. I love her with everything that I’ve got but I’m starting to believe when they say loves just a temporary emotion. Because if she loved me dont you think she’d see if I was sad? When I bring it up that I’m feeling down she wouldn’t complain that I’m making everything about me even though I hardly bring it up. I don’t think she loves me, she’s loves that I don’t make her feel lonely, she loves the fact that no matter what she says or does to me I’ll always be there for her 

I don’t really remember what it’s like being happy, everyday it feels like I’m being pulled deeper and deeper underwater. I used to be on meds and it was kinda okay but it’s so hard to get an appointment nowadays so I can’t even get the meds or appropriate therapy/counselling

I don’t know what to do or who to turn to, all that claim to love me make me feel even worse for even bringing up the fact I’m sad or make me feel as if it’s my fault even though I’m trying every I can.

Writing down my thoughts post panic attack,2,mkw12a,0,"I feel like a failure. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I can't fix this. It feels like things are just going to keep getting harder for me. I really tried. I really wanted to get better and get to a place where I'm no longer suicidal or depressed or have anxiety. 

Especially the anxiety. 
It makes everything so hard. I can't function around people, I can't stand up for myself, I can't leave my home without feeling anxious, and I can't hold a job because I keep having panic attacks and feeling suicidal. 

I can't do this anymore. I'm tired of trying and feeling like I've failed and let everyone down. I just want it to end. I don't want to suffer anymore. I hate it because at the same time, I can't stop thinking and feeling so bad for all the people who do actually care and love me. I know they want to help and I don't blame them for not knowing how. I wish I didn't have to be around other people, only them. If I didn't have them, I'd have killed myself already. I don't know why I'm like this. I wish their love and support was enough to fix me. I don't really want to live this life anymore, but don't want to hurt them.

I'm only going to stay alive for them and block out the rest of the world."
Missing myself.,1,ml0i6w,1,"I was a successful professional and had a major depression episode in 2015.

I miss the person I used to be."
I'm not sure if i'm depressed.,2,mkvzqg,0,"I have no peace.

I used to live a a care free life and i don't doubt it will return to that when i am eased. 

That care free life consisted of not caring about school/grades as that as a kid used to give me anxiety so just quit caring.

I started to ask myself the question what if you die tommorow? Where you happy before or were you just wasiting your time studieng while you could have had fun.

I started chosing fun over grades and stuff.

This way of life really gave me enjoyment and i was happy not anxious. I was living in the moment.

A little backstory i have a niece who is my world i love her endlessly. I can't live without her.
I have severe fear of losing her and want spend as much time with her as i can and i do. There is no particular health reason or anything that i have a higher risk of losing her but i seem to just put myself through it.

I don't think i'm depressed all the time but right now as of writing this i have cried on the toilet and am extremly dipped.

My niece was over for the weekend and i have a physics term tommorow, my niece left today and i decided to play with her instead of severly studieng as i thought id waste my time anyway.

I have a backup plan and can redo the test next year while not being behind but it still ails me that ill fail for some reason.

I also had two months to prepare but i just didnt do shit, i lacked the motivation and procastinated.

Ngl i enjoy what i do during the procastination. (Playing games with my beloved friends).

But rn i am in a severe dip and feeel very sad, tho writing this down helped me somewhat."
realization,4,mkqvp3,0,i think one of the worst parts or experiences of depression is having the realization you will never truly be 100% happy again. it’s like a an orbit of feeling uplifted just to fall back down. it makes you really pause and think and acknowledge what and who you are. might just be a random messy thought but i know personally for me it hurts every time the realization comes back.
"Long-distance girlfriend on Pristiq since mid-january for illness related situational depression. Has slowly become more and more apathetic, less compassionate, emotional expression and communication dwindled. Increased dosage mid-feb and all that become sharply worse in the last few weeks.",2,mkvwgf,0,"
Since mid-january, my partner has become more detached and emotionally distant. It wasn’t that bad at first. I was prepared for the decrease in sexual attention/drive. But it seems to have decreased all forms of empathy and positive emotions in regards to our relationship. In feb, she increased dosage because she felt numb and like a zombie on the lower dosage. And according to her, it relieved her depression which I believe. She is definitely less melancholic. However, she has become apathetic and unable to feel or express her emotions (in her own words).

She went from professing her intense love to me 6-8 weeks ago, telling she never thought she’d feel this way about anyone again, to telling me a few days ago, she doesn’t know if she’s really interested in maintaining this relationship. She has become extremely annoyed and disdainful to me. To the point of being actively cruel. The difference in her behaviour between now and even just a week and half ago, is giving me whiplash. If I ask her to communicate what she’s feeling, she gets extremely upset and says she doesn’t know what she’s feeling and I need to leave her alone.

A week into march, we had our first big argument and she dumped me. But came back the next day begging me to take her back and she doesn’t know why she did what she did. Reprofessed her love and infatuation. Said “I was trying to listen to my favourite music today and I literally couldn’t hear it. I can’t hear music without you.” So I accepted her apology as long as she promised to work on improving our bond. Since then she’s done the opposite. Its hit the point where I brought up that exact quote 2 days ago and she basically rolled her eyes :( its like im talking to a completely different person.

We’re long distance so this relationship relies on communication and active effort. Before Jan, I can honestly say we’d never had any sort of friction or communication difficulties. We used to literally remark on how good we were at conflict resolution with each other. She’s already on the extreme end of anxious avoidant insecure style attachment. But that was easily surmountable prior to her starting these meds.

Am I correct? Is it the meds? I might just be grasping at straws to avoid facing the reality that she’s lost feelings for me. Her acute illness flare-up ended mid feb and her life’s starting to pick back up to what it used to be. She relied on me heavily for emotional support through Nov-Jan as she was in complete isolation. I made myself extremely available to her. It seems to be a combo of her no longer needing the emotional/social lifeline and her growing numb from pristiq. But even prior to her flare-up she was extremely compassionate and attentive. Since the reason for her situational depression is gone, can she come off it?


Sorry for the essay.
Tldr; Girlfriend has 180’d personality wise on me in just a few weeks. And all changes seem to line up with changes in AD medication regime. Does anyone have similar experiences with advice?"
The only thing I want in life is unattainable,2,mkvst6,1,"Being able to find a girlfriend who would eventually be my wife, starting a family and living with them is the only scenario in which I see happiness as a possibility. But it's impossible for me. There's nothing I can do to look decent. I'm short and ugly, I'm 21 and I'm going to be bald by 23 and my bodybuilding genetics are absolutely pathetic so I can never have a nice body. All I can think about is wanting to kill myself. I don't see a way out. I just have to die and that's it. Over 3 years of this shit killing me on a daily basis and it's just gotten worse. Not even a friend I can talk to about it so I resort to posting here. What the fuck can I do in this situation besides die"
Don’t know how much more I can take,1,ml0ab3,0,"Since posting this I seriously can’t take much more of it. I’ve been on meds for a few weeks, the last close person to me has messed with my head big time and now with everything else factoring into place I just can’t. I’ve been going through this for 8 years, I’ve attempted the easy way out in the past and since then nothing has really gotten any better. I don’t feel anything. If anything feelings wise I feel alone. I have tried talking to numerous of people about it including family and I still don’t feel any better. I am numb to the point where I can’t cry anymore. I know I’m not happy deep down but I can’t express emotions like that anymore. I’m more irritated and a part of me has started thinking of the easy way out as in what if I do this and do that. I want to be ok again, I want to be happy, why can’t I be happy? Seriously I’ve had enough. I can’t be close to someone without feeling like I’m a burden or I’m just a “second choice”. Just for once I want to be happy again, just to feel something more than this loneliness or worthlessness. I couldn’t care less if I slipped off my motorbike and hit something at high speed. I just want this demon to go away one way or another.

I’ve kept secrets of things in my past to myself because I know no one would ever believe me and society won’t see it the way another man would view it. I had a toxic relationship in the past, both  mentally and now when I think about it physically. After a certain amount of time I was being told “we are having s*x” whether I was tired or not that didn’t matter. She has a “split personality” and used it to her excuse to force herself on top of me and try to you know what. That was until someone walked in the room and she pretended to be knocked out on the couch and say “what happened?” To later say her split personality came out. It was later mentioned that she potentially cheated on me more than 100 times, she tried to get people to beat me up and murder me. She lied about being a gang leader, made up fake deaths and pretended to be a member and using someone’s pictures on Facebook just to talk through them. She got me into a street fight with her ex who she cheated on me with (1 of them) stole more than £3000 off me and turned everyone of my mates against me and now I have very few people in my life.

That’s just tip of the ice berg that has lead me to this point. I just want to be ok. I want to be able to trust people and just be more but I can’t take much more of it. The numbness and bad days are taking over and I want it to stop."
I can't breathe,1,ml0a3t,1,"This has been going on for a couple weeks. It feels like I'm on the edge of a cliff, like I'm holding my breath for the plunge. I feel as though it is the start of a panic attack but it never comes on fully. It's so tiring and demoralizing. My depression rages on.

I have spots of very good positivity in my life right now and I can totally appreciate them and it ""helps"" though the depression still continues. All I can do right now is cry and gasp for breath. 

I don't form in the wet sand. I don't form at all. 😢😞"
it isn't getting better,4,mkqnwc,0,"i consistently see ""it gets better"" as the slogan for all kinds of mental health issues. but what do you do if it doesn't, or if better isn't good enough? every day i feel as bad as the day before, but the fact that ""it"" is not getting ""better"" makes the same thing every day feel like something worse each day that passes. it makes me feel like something is wrong with me when nothing has gotten better for years. when it's always the same grinding slog no matter what i do. i'm doing everything i can, really. i broke down the other day, and i contacted one of the helplines, saying basically this, and they suggested a bunch of things that i already try to do, things that only keep me barely clinging on. what do you do if all the resources in the world only keep you holding on to life for dear life?  what do you do if your ""better"" still isn't good enough? the responder said that sometimes good enough is all you can do, and i guess that's true, but what if your good enough isn't enough to you know, get you money to eat? at this rate i'm going to lose my job, because i just can't do the work anymore even though i'm trying so hard, and i've already maxed out asking my friends for help, and they all have their own shit already. every therapist close by is booked--pandemics are stressful i guess--and as every day goes by, as ""good"" never comes, i feel like i'm never going to get there. and what really is the point of trying so hard when nothing that you do even lets you approach the basic degree of functioning expected for being a member of society?"
"everytime i publicly ask for help online or say that i’m struggling, i either get ignored or be told that i’m attention seeking",13,mkjhnf,8,"multiple times i’ve privately told my parents and (ex) friends that i’m struggling but they just ignore me every time.

How can I care about my meaningless job when we’re all in a crisis?,12,mkjgjw,1,"I have been having the worst pandemic fatigue and depression the past few weeks, feeling even worse than I did at the very first week of the pandemic. Our city has been the longest locked down in all of North America with it being extended now another month, and likely extended again after that. I’m so done with this, I see the same people week by week. Yesterday I sat on my couch staring at the ceiling because there’s nothing to do and I’m too afraid to see anyone since the news coverage is ramping up and there’s constantly articles about younger people dying or that we’re running out of ventilators. I really can’t take it anymore. 

To top it all off I work in advertising where it’s literally as if covid doesn’t exist to these people. They regularly ask people to work weekends and we can absolutely never catch a break. If you ever even admitted to needing a mental health day you’d likely be on a list of people for the next lay off. Our city keeps going into lockdown and they rarely say anything about it or check in on people. I just never thought I’d see a life where someone’s thirty second commercial was more important than my life. I put so much of myself into my work and I feel like it’s never enough. I’m always being asked to take on more from other people (they say it’s because I’m so good at my job.....) and no raises because of the pandemic of course. 

I don’t know how to get out of this cycle. I can’t quit because I absolutely need the money. I’ve interviewed for other jobs as well but I never get them, I think I’m having a hard time interviewing on zoom. I used to be able to nail interviews and always get the job and now it’s always a no."
Realizations about dealing with relationships/friendships while depressed that others may be able to relate to,2,mkvm1y,1,"•I’ve realized lately that being depressed and dating someone or trying to maintain relationships is a million times harder for us than for others who may not have a chronic illness. It takes double the effort to take care of myself and contribute to a healthy partnership or friendships. This becomes increasingly difficult when you experience the symptoms of wanting to isolate yourself 

•A lot of times I’m just going through the motions. I’ll go have dinner with a friend or go on a walk with my boyfriend and just dissociate because I feel so terrible inside, but I feel that they’d think I was crazy if they knew. I feel like I’m just playing the part so much of the time and don’t even know how to be present. 

•I feel I need to hide the darkest parts of myself from them because I think they would be afraid to know who I really am or my true thoughts. How I have breakdowns and drink excessively or engage in other harmful behaviors. This becomes exhausting especially if you’re someone who tries to be happy externally a lot of the time, but eventually you break. When they do catch a glimpse of how much of a mess I am, it further causes me shame and deepens the depression because I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want anyone to take care of me. This is my mess and I know it’s sad. My heart breaks for myself when I think about how much I’ve struggled 

•I know I have attachment issues (anxious attachment style) but I find it hard to allow myself to truly connect with others because I know I’m fragile. If I were to lose them, and they were a large part of my life, it would make things worse. It’s easier to keep them at arms length in my mind, so it’s almost like I’ve become an avoidant attachment instead. 

•I second guess myself all the time. I’m extra sensitive so small things set me off and I blame myself even when the other person is actually to blame. It makes it hard to not have insecurities

This shit is hard. I’ve been in therapy for almost ten years because of continuous trauma and am on medication, and I still struggle every damn day. To whoever is reading this, you are brave to keep going. It takes so much strength to wake up every morning and put your feet on the floor with the amount of pain we experience. I hope that someday it gets easier for all of us and that we start to have small experiences of happiness here and there. I don’t know that any of us will be fully happy, but better is all we can hope for."
Can’t tell if I’m depressed,2,mkvkjc,1,"I’d (19/M) always been a generally happy person until last year. Because of that I don’t think I know what depression is, I think I have it now but I’m not sure. 

I’m in my 2nd year of college, I’m in the dorms currently. Since we just do like 90% online classes, I just stay in my room all day. I just can’t seem to do anything, and it’s been like that for the past year. My room is so messy that there’s no more walkspace left; I just have to jump from the doorway to my bed. I haven’t done the laundry in a month now. For most of my day, I just lay in bed and stay on my phone, or I just look at the ceiling and think about my past happy memories or look at pictures of it. I eat once a day at 2am, some Mac n cheese and a coke. I used to have many friends, but I just want nothing to do with any humans anymore. I used to get texts from them but I just couldn’t get myself to respond. Eventually, the phone stopped ringing, and I was ok with it. I probably have racked up like 15 missing assignments in the past 2 months. I’m terribly homesick, but I don’t really want to go home because I don’t want to see my family. I’ve somehow gained like 15 pounds this year though, even though I only eat once a day. I haven’t cut my hair in 9 months (I used to cut it every month prior to that). I don’t know, I’m just like it right now and I don’t see an end to it. Like, can’t even tell if I’m sad because idk, I think I’m ok with it. Idk. Idk. 

I just wanted to write this somewhere, no need to respond to it I guess."
Defeated,3,mksmrm,0,"CW: toxic family, abuse, drugs, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts,  politics

If you comment assholery based on politics alone, shame on you, don't kick someone while they're down. 

I come from a toxic family, my father is an abusive meth head, and my mother has anxiety/depression, and allows shitty men to stay in her life, while also dipping in and out of drug habits. My father got custody of my little brother and I pre-meth, when I was 14 years old and brother was 8. I developed more anxiety and a deep depression living with him, him being verbally and mentally abusive, only physical on one occasion, and consistently being drunk. I wanted to kill myself at a young age, and nobody understood that I could be depressed, it just wasn't accepted as a real thing. My grandma (dad's mother) also lived there and backed my father and increased the abuse. I knew I had to leave, or I would kill myself, so I moved to a different state with my mother, who lived in a trailer park and was married to another verbally abusive man. Better than my father, because ""step-dad"" was a trucker and was barely there. They went through a divorce, and she wanted to move back home, and I couldn't do it. I emancipated myself and worked while finishing highschool. I moved in with my boyfriend at the time who turned out to be another abuser and raped me, I was in a cycle I could not escape. I finally found the right time to get away from that relationship, and started working different entry level jobs throughout the years. I wanted to make enough money to get custody of my brother and support us both, especially because my father became addicted to meth in that time. I did when I found a better steady job, and got him to live with me. Raising my younger brother was hard, but I gave it my best. I was living with roommates at the time, and when the pandemic and political turmoil hit, this put a lot of strain on everyone in that house. My brother was being talked to about politics without me knowing. The same politics my hate filled father spouted. I confronted the situation as best I could, trying to minimize the bad influence on my brother. He was getting more and more toxic though, and I didn't know what to do about it. He lied a lot, took money, even stole a car from a roommate. One night, he tolded me he wouldn't care if someone was a rapist, as long as he fit his ideals, he would still support them.  He said this with tue knowledge that I was raped. I couldn't do it anymore, he had just turned 18, so I kicked him out. It hurt so bad, because all I've ever wanted was to take care of him, but I couldn't stand what kind of person he became to me. I couldn't help seeing him just as I saw our father. That same week, my roommates wanted me out for being a strain on their mental health, even though I was alone in my room most of the time. I knew it was more than that, I wanted to be away from people anyway. So in a short span, I lost my brother, and two close friends. I live by myself, I'm terrified of making friends, my brother and I got better for a little while, but then eventually I was beibg taken advantage of again. I feel like I have nobody, and I'm too closed off to even try to connect. I feel so defeated, like my life has no purpose, I'm just perpetually working a repetitive and unfulfilling job, using up all my free time just to go home and be too tired to do anything. I'm scheduled for therapy but not until the end of this month, this will be my third time. Sometimes I feel like the trauma will kill me, through stress and an unfulfilling life. I just want my baby brother back, I feel heartbroken"
Depressed before the pandemic,1,mkzymb,0,"In elementary school, I was doing poorly because of not having any motivation to finish it or I rushed through it so I could get it done.

Barbie dream house,3,mksa5x,0,"Sitting in my childhood bedroom where I used to play with Barbie. high school musical and Hannah Montana posters on my wall. Journals full of lyrics and stories.an idea maybe I can be a rockstar too. Dancing to umbrella by Rihanna. 

Well I changed my room to another room and made this room my “study room”. I have a guitar in here my dad bought. Do you think I ever learned it? I have many notebooks full of poems, lyrics, stories. Do you think I’ll ever finish them? I have paint but my paintings aren’t very good. It’s April and I’m just now taking down the Christmas decor. I’ve refused to come in this room because it’s too hard for me to do school work. 

I’m going to school to be a teacher but I really don’t know. 

Out of nowhere, an unorganized mess surrounds me and tears fall out of me like waterfalls. I’ve been crying like this every night but now it’s 3 in the afternoon. I tried to reach out to a friend but I’m not anyone’s priorities may it be first, second, third. And everyone just ignored me. And even when I said I was sad I got no reaction. And today I say I’m doing good and want to try to talk and just have a normal conversation and have someone to talk to and I get ignored again by everyone. I just want someone to care about me like I care about them. But none of them do so I’m done and they can all depend on all their other options instead. It hurts being alone it’s not fair. I’m not close to family, friends, no one. And people always claim they’re here to talk. Well I tried and you weren’t there. So... yeah I’m done. 

I was thinking too, I’ve been asking God why I have no one and it appears he doesn’t listen either. So I don’t know really what the issue is. But .... I guess that’s my fucking life

And I keep telling myself it’s okay just focus on yourself and I try so hard to be a good version but... none of those dreams I always think about are happening. Schools not going well. Life’s not going well. So obviously nothing is working. I’ve been alone my whole life I would really appreciate it if I knew I had someone in this life. I’ll never stop believing in God but sh*t, I wish he would At least give me a sign I’m going to be okay."
"White Nights,White knights.",1,mkzsve,0,"I just don't get it, why the nights have to be blunt and miserable.

Does it matter anymore living? I will get the same conclusion, ""take care, be happy "" People give me blunt advice that won't help me a bit.  Why nights suck? Never found the answer but their own analogy.

In fact I don’t like anyone at all, no one is interesting enough to satisfy me in a conversation. I have no hobbies as well lmao.

I probably sound like a school shooter right now lol, if I ever had the chance to shoot up a school I would be the first and only victim.

I am beautiful, I am really good in my profession, have my own company, 1 degree, 2 masters degrees, great friends, stable family, have traveled a lot, in my 20's..., I always manage to get what I want, and STILL I AM NOT HAPPY is never enough, and lately is worse and worse.... for the last two years was really bad and I blamed the divorce but now I am with someone new and HE IS GREAT, AMAZING! but still, I am sad and still, there is days where I am not productive at all, I just stay in bed all day,.. and still I accomplish a lot being like this still I manage to keep business up, go on amazing adventures etc because i have this UPS : Where I do A LOT and everything is great ,,, then COMPLETELY DOWN.. FOR DAYS.... AND IS  when no one is around I sink into my sadness thinking like there are two versions of me, I already reached out to the psychiatrist and of course I was recommended to take antidepressants but I am not sure, I know I have nothing lose but... I also don't want to use my last resource what if this doesn't help? what is next? I have already been in therapy before and I feel like is not enough,,, I just don't know anymore... I even try going to church to see if is my spirit that is broken?

anyone can relate?

I would love to hear that I am not the only one....."
Can't sleep and need to get stuff off my chest,1,mkz4zn,0,"Hi everyone, sorry to bother. It's late and my brain is not letting me sleep, so i want to try to write some shit out and mybe get a clear mind at least for this night. I wrote something, but deleted most of it because I felt like I will just bore everyone who reads this, so i will try to keep myself short. 
I'm dealing with a lot of selfhate mainly. I feel like a failure, I never accomplished anything in my life. I have no talents that'd help me get a job I like, or a job in general. I even get rejected for jobs to fill in shelves. In every school and every class I was, people never wanted to be friends with me, doesn't matter how hard I tried, but many of them liked to pick on me for whatever reason. I tried to change my attitude in hopes that people wouldnt bully me when they meet me, but it never worked. Late at night I think about it and wonder how others perceive me and what made me the target of their actions. I have little to no self confidence anymore, I just hate myself so much. I feel like I am never enough for anyone. I have friends that love me as much as I love them, also a caring boyfriend, but I still feel like I'll dissapoint them and that I dont deserve them. I feel so bad for them because they do everything for me, but I still can't fucking be happy. I feel so ungrateful. Every little stressful situation in my life makes me do selfharming im form of cutting and ripping my eyebrows out. I started cutting at the beginning of this year and it makes me hate myself even more. I just want the pain to end, but im too much of a coward to end it, which is good i guess. I was thinking about going to therapy, but I feel like people got it worse than me and that I shouldn't take a spot for people who truly need it. Some days I just feel so empty, sick of myself. I dissapoint so many people, I can't take it anymore. I don't have a plan for the future, I dont know what to do with myself and yet im so scared of the future. I want to life, but I hate myself so much that it makes it unbearable sometimes.
So yeah, I think that's it for now, sorry if it bored you guys. I just needed to vent for a bit, have a lovely day."
I get depressed when I don’t have school,1,mkz3eu,0,"Whenever I have a break like spring break or summer I start to get really depressed. After school starts again I stop. I think it’s either the lack of interaction with other people, my family, or maybe schools keeps me out of my own head. I’m wondering if anyone else feels this way"
Stuck in the mud,1,mkz3e6,0,"I loathe people who casually throw around ""I love you."" You're a cunt in the moment to some who've never had that shit. It's a palpable emotion for me, I WILL love you to death, so when you split in my hard times, I wanna set myself on fire because I feel emotionally cucked for a moments respute and weed... I hate people."
I can’t keep up this brave face anymore.,3,mkrb0t,0,"So it’s been a little over a year since my 5 month hospitalization. And I truly thought this might get better. 

But boom covid. Boom promotion. Boom family member getting cancer. Boom friends leaving. Boom heart murmur. Boom my dad righting his wrongs. 

Not all are bad. But holy crap. My life was shit before these major responsibilities. And now I just don’t know how to do this. I can’t keep lying to myself and everyone else that I’m okay.

Im starting to think this actually will never end. And I don’t know how I’m going to make it."
i might be addicted to cutting,3,mkr7cc,7,i want to cut myself i want to feel pain. i want to feel the sting while i’m working i want to stop the pain. i told this lady that i wanted medicine the closest that i can get some is in 9 days i want to slit my fucking wrist
Depression and in a relationship?,1,mkytnj,1,I’m curious if there’s anyone 30+ that suffers from depression and in a successful relationship. I feel like I’m just never going to have one and would love to hear some positive stories from people that are in a relationship.
My dad is too strict over corona,3,mkr29v,2,"I know this corona thing is serious but i feel like my dad has taken it too far. The last time i saw any of my friends was back in mid January when i finished my exams, since then i have went out once with 1 of my friends and the reason i went was to get my mom a birthday gift for her birthday, which he started to yell at me at for and telling me you don't have to get her a gift.

I only leave the house once or twice a month to help my mom with groceries, i dont take off my mask at all, wear gloves and stay from everyone idk. I know he is doing this because he is afraid of it but both him and my mom have been vaccinated.

I'm talking about this because i just went to tell him i wanna go out with 2 friends (who like wise barely go out) to some flat empty land on top of a hill far from eveyone. He proceeded to yell at me and tell me no i cant because go, i told him i chose there because it's far from anyone else due to the corona thing. I told him it's also for my mental health as all my siblings are studying abroad, i havent seen anyone in months and all i do is just sit in my room, he told me to not make this dramatic and go cry about it.

What do i do?

Tldr; my dad is overally strict about corona to the point i havent left the house in months"
"I tried to talk to my dad about my depression, and he just suggested I talk to a friend, and didn't mention it again. Point taken...",2,mktwf1,0,"My dad usually calls me lazy, and frames me as stubborn and unwilling when I don't manage to do everything because of my depression. I am in the middle of an episode now, and everyday life is hard. Everything seems so pointless, and telling my dad that I am not feeling well was kind of a big step. I have previously thought there was no point trying to explain my behavior, he sees all my symptoms of depression and lables it laziness. When I mentioned it, he made it clear that he did not want to talk further, by just saying that I should talk to someone. I asked who, and he said ""a good friend"". He gets mad when I don't participate in the usual pleasantries and smile and be polite, while it takes all the energy I have just to get out of bed. 

I have even told him it hurts when he calls me lazy, and that I am not plotting against him trying to avoid helping out."
Don't want to die but tired of trying,2,mktusc,0,"Well Life has been a cluster fuck. Why is that I was better at managing my life when I didn't have to focus on my mental health. I'm making  great strides and it's been trying but fulfilling journey. But everything is going to shit. My body has decided to break down and produce too many cells and I'm feeling every cell division. Sick and running a fever which put me out of work which means I'm not making money and money makes the world go round. 

It's exhausting trying to manage my mental health (MDD, PTSD, Bi-Polar and Anxiety)  It was almost easier to be a functioning wreck with addiction than it is to be aware of these issues"

Depression makes everything so pointless,1,mkyko5,0,"Why is life so unfair. What is a life without happiness? To me, without happiness, love, joy, awe, bliss, etc life cannot be life. To me it can't be a life well lived which makes me feel so horrible. I know life isn't only happy feelings but i am literally NEVER happy. Why.... Even if i met the girl of my dreams tomorow i'd probably just ghost her due to being so depressed. Not like that would happen though. Im beyond undesireable, i'll be alone forever. Been undesired my whole life. I feel like I have a curse on me. Even at school I was always the odd one out, never fit in anywhere in my damn life, and if I ever did for a short amount of time I always ruined it. I will try more medication soon , but I truly don't think anything can help me. I feel so damn hopeless man. I feel pyschedelics also ruined my brain, like i think it did permament damage but i was depressed for that. Been depressed waaayy too long man. I don't have energy or care to change my life."
Getting worse.,4,mkopj4,8,"Hi, I don’t really know where to begin with this or how to phrase it but here goes. I’ve been depressed since I was around 17, I’m now 23, in those 6 or so years I’ve felt incredibly low, trying to take my life twice. I’ve also felt better more recently after going to therapy and finding a medication that worked for me. However, I’m getting worse again

I have been out of work due to the pandemic which I don’t think has helped with there being pretty much no routine but I just wake up every day thinking there’s no point in living anymore, my intrusive thoughts are getting worse by the day and I don’t really know what to do. I keep thinking the pandemic will be better soon and things will return to a more normal way of being but now the thought of that gives me severe anxiety. I have people around me I can talk to but I feel like if I say to them how I’m feeling then they’ll get worried, I’ve already put them through so much and they don’t deserve it

I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I guess I just had to tell someone"
How do you change when there’s no hope?,1,mkyjt5,0,"I just don’t know how to help myself or even ask for help.  50, divorced after 20 years.  I found love completely accidentally and managed to ruin that relationship after a short 6 months.  Now i have nothing left, zero reserves.  

I know people are just trying to help but saying things like “try new things, do things you enjoy, love yourself before looking for love...”. None of that is helpful.  How do i love myself if I’m completely alone.  I’m not talking about not having a significant other, i am talking about zero friends, zero contact outside of work.

I could die at home and not be missed for at least a week.  Literally and completely isolated.  I just can’t see any way forward.  After my divorce i was almost in this spot and found love 5 months later.  Now thinking about going through the heart ache and soul wrenching agony again is more than i can bear.  

I don’t even know why I’m writing this.  When does life become too much?  Why continue struggling when there’s less hope every day?"
Messy,2,mktmnx,0,"21 (M) It's like my head is forever in a mess. I can't function like how a normal human being would. I struggle to work with people or talk to people. It's been a tough time for me to do the simplest bit of things and I literally don't have any will in me to do anything. It's been going on for months now and I have constant anxiety of how am I going to survive in the future when I can't even survive on my own. I'm in need of a miracle in my life. To save me from being dumb. To save me so that I'll be able to understand others better and just let this inner voice to stop speaking evil. I really hate this. I want to be good. But it just seems that I'm really far from being good. I'm tiring everyone out. I'm tiring myself out. I just need a way out of this. I don't know how will I able to find a job when I'm simply the worst person to work with. I'm just really damn slow at everything now. Even talking to people is just a hard thing for me to do. All of these constant worries really tires me down. I don't want to kill myself. I want to live. But I don't want to live this way. I just want to be a better person, a better friend, a better human being in general. But FUCK man. I take so much time to decide on something simple, and I've destroyed so many friendships of mine because I'm trapped in this stupid head. I've been staying home most of the time and I'm just rotting day by day. All I do is sleep, wake up, shower, eat and then sleep again. It's like this is my life now. I just feel so off right out in the public, or with my friends because most of the time I wouldn't be able to comprehend what some of my friends are talking about and I just feel like a totally lost guy and the person who's not needed in the circle anymore. LORD SAVE ME.

TLDR; Constant anxiety about the future because I'm dumb and slow, tiring everyone in my life because I'm too busy living in my head. Stuck in a rut, and struggling to find my way to save myself and prepare for my future."
Plz don't hate me for saying this but,3,mkqmfq,0,"Just before I say what I want to say, I just wanted to say that I do not consider myself the kind of person who wallows in self pity or feels particularly sorry for themselves. If anything most of the time I would say I am quite tough minded with my depression and anxiety, in that if I'm feeling crap instead of letting myself feel sad I will tell myself that I just need to push on through with my mental health and that there's no time for crying or getting upset. I'm not saying crying or getting upset means that you are a self pitying person because 99% of the time that isn't true, but just for me the way my brain makes me feel is that obviously if I cry that means that I'm letting my anxiety and depression make me feel unhappy and sorry for myself, because my brain makes me feel like emotionally strong people would constantly be optimistic even if they were feeling suicidal, and they would be able to smile through their depression or laugh at their own problems. That probably sounds fucked and people are probably going to hate me for saying that but that's just what my brain is telling me at the moment. But even though I know so many people experience depression or suicidal thoughts/ideation every/most days, and some people will read this and think ""yea well life isn't fair get over it"", and I know I probably sound like a three year old saying this but to be honest, I think it doesn't matter how many people in the world have depression or suicidal thoughts, to put it simply, having depression which for many people feels like a try not to die challenge, if it sounds naive I'm sorry but for someone to have to question wether they should kill themselves most days that doesn't strike me as being very fair. Yes a lot of people have depression but even in the world today, there are still a lot of people who haven't got depression or suicidal thoughts and I think it's actually quite toxic if anyone ever feels like it's okay to make someone feel like they're not allowed to feel sorry for themselves because they're feeling depressed/suicidal, just because lots of other people also feel the same. Like you wouldn't tell someone who had been diagnosed with cancer that they shouldn't feel sad or sorry for themselves just because lots of people in the world have cancer"
Wishing to know more about the different types of SSRI medications!,3,mkqkhm,5,"Someone commented on my Luvox thread I created and told me: 

> What's special about Fluvoxamine compared to other SSRI is it's very high affinity for the sigma receptor, which is related to anti-anxiety/depression affects. Other SSRIs don't have that level of sigma receptor agonism.

What are some of the other different SSRI meds and what makes them special? I want to change my med to zoloft because I heard it doesn't cause weight gain but I don't know anything else about it.

Can someone provide any helpful info about any other SSRI meds like the helpful gentleman in my thread yesterday I quoted?"
There's only one person that motivates me to keep living,1,mkyc5p,0,"My mental health has always been shit, but these past three years have been one of a pain in the ass. I am hopeless, I can't see myself living in the future (sometimes I get the feeling that they want me gone for good). My family doesn't care about my current mental state and has made it crystal clear multiple times. I used to have some friends in real life but I pretty much lost contact with them (we met at college, some of them left and some others are now 1 year behind me and I've lost complete contact with them). I wasn't the closest to them in the first place so I don0t know if it's appropriate for me to tell them about what I've been going through.

The only person that seems to care about my existence is someone I've known for 2 years: my only internet friend. She doesn't know I am struggling, but whenever I talk to her I feel like there's hope for me, that life it's worth living. She's a dear friend I want to see grow and succeed in life, and that inspires me to keep going. 

Life is a piece of shit, but it's less shit when I remember she exists. If I kill myself she will never know why I stopped texting her."
My Depression is sometimes childish and I HATE IT,2,mktjjx,1,"Literally like just now I can go on instagram and see someone who I used to talk to like another friend of mine's post (who I didn't even know knew each other) and when i saw that I immediately thought that they've become friends to spite me, plotting something behind my back or something. 

I always try and remind myself that the world is small so it's not so impossible circumstances and why has everything got to revolve around me!

But that only works for like 5 seconds. I feel really suicidal now because it's so hard not think that little by little people are gonna hop aboard the ""conspire against me"" bus, and it's gonna follow me my whole life.

Why can't I just let stupid things go!!!"
I don’t know what is wrong with me,1,mkybwm,0,"Life wasn’t always OK, but it seems to be doing alright at the moment. My attempt was 5 years ago. The last time I self-harmed was 3 years ago. It’s about to be a year since I visited a psychiatrist and CBD (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) worked out very well. I’m pretty sure I have moved on from my ex-boyfriend and best friend; I am fine with being single since the past few years and my night terrors regarding my assault and harassment stopped too. My relations with my family and with faith are much, much better. 

I have everything yet I have this gnawing sense that something is about to go wrong. That I don’t deserve everything going right and I should spiral back, lose control and sabotage everything and anything I have. I can’t seem to focus, I can’t seem to sleep at all, and when I do fall asleep I don’t want to wake up. I physically can NOT wake up if I do fall asleep. My grades were doing very well in the past few months but we are in lockdown again and now they’re spiralling. I don’t even have an answer to what’s wrong and who is to blame... at least my problems before had a pointer. What in the hell am I supposed to do with myself at this point? Why can’t I just be happy? Why can’t I just heal and get over it all? Why does it all come back every night?"
Unsure what to do now.,4,mkociu,4,"I've posted here before, and I just really want to get these thoughts out of my mind and off my chest. I honestly don't mind if no one answers, I've come to accept and fully believe no one understands me

I'm not poor anymore, I'm not struggling to buy whatever I want whenever I want, I have a loving family, I have a wonderful girlfriend, I have amazing friends, I'm trying to practice to be more religious but there is a sensation running in me, one that I absolutely hate, I'm so depressed

Ever since I was young in high school, I've been putting myself in the position of a victim of circumstances, and now that I finally changed that, a part of me desperately wants to be degraded, to feel lower, to feel. powerless, so feel looked down upon, because that's how I felt growing up. I keep desiring to be hated, to be disappointed by people's action, to be left alone in the corner. I'm grateful for so much, I really am, but I want to be one people look at with disgust, that people find annoying to be around.

I want to be alone, I want to be enviously looking at others thinking I wish I have what they do, even when I'm in a perfectly normal position in life. I can't help this desire to want to have that aching pain in my chest. I enviously want to have a trophy wife who I can flaunt and say I deserve her for all my struggles and pain. Someone with a stunning body desired by any man who sees her with envy towards me just like how I do at other men. An expensive car that I can flex at all those who laugh at me. A lavish house where I feel empty. I constantly turn to porn and sex to fill the emptiness.

I know it sounds like I have a mental problem, I'm completely aware, I can't see a therapist, because then I'd be using part of my savings, and people would get concerned about where all my money is going. I can't speak about it to anyone but the wall in my room hoping I'll just forget the next morning and continue until I have my next mental breakdown again. I want to rot away in my room, I want to stop pretending like I'm some perfect human being who's always nice, intelligent, and creative. I just want to be sad in a corner with pity being thrown at me like scraps. I want people to be disappointed in me for all the bad things they don't know I've done. For all the people I've hurt just because I didn't get what I want and how I wanted it.

I have every desire to die alone pretending like I fought the most difficult struggle there is and I can finally rest. I go on PornHub and Chaturbate, looking for reasons to be depressed, desiring things that I shouldn't. I keep forcing myself into these delusions that I'm depressed and I start crying by myself being angry at myself for being such a disgusting human being in the first place. I don't want to change, I never wanted to change, I just wanted to die so that I can stop being such a sick fuck and not continue to hurt those around by having this fucking mental problem anymore."
Do you ever,1,mky7qb,0,"I'm just going to say it, kill meeee!! I hate being alive!! 

Do you ever have those times you just get so crushed? 
It's not something in particular but it's everything and it's nothing. Like you just want to be free of your mind?"
Dealing with family,1,mky370,0,"how do you deal with family when they seem dismissive of you/me getting help?

My dad agreed to let me see a therapist but he also made a point to say that i'm not mentally unwell and that all i need to do is to walk outside in the sun and exercise more. 

My mom and my oldest sister are taking a hands off approach and not really talking to me (not entirely irregular in my family)

and my other sister which i thought i was closest to in the family is taking a supportive yet frustrated/passive aggressive approach which really triggers my guilt sometimes. 

like i understand that 'the formula' for getting out of depression is to eat 3 meals, exercise, see the sun, talk to people, etc. but is it just me being whiny or is it that it's actually a lot harder than it looks. and i get that it's frustrating because i don't talk to my family about my problems but the family dynamic that's understood by me about my family is that no one talks about their emotions like what do they expect. i feel like if it goes to a certain point, i'll seriously break down and my family won't know how to support me other than telling me to shape up. it's so frustrating the way they're treating me and my seeking help"
I want to help my friend out as much as I can,1,mky13b,1,"So starting at the beginning of the school year I’ve grown closer and closer to this girl, I’m probably her most closest friend because her friends all have been jerks to her, we also have a bit of a romantic thing going on but nothing official and I’m saying these things because I want to know what I can do to make her feel better, even if it’s for a day or a minute. Last night while we were on ft a wave of depression hit her and she kept saying that she was being so annoying and the worst and that I should just hang up and I kept trying to say things to prove that I do really like her and care about her, cause I do. She then said how no matter how much nice things I say or anything I do her brain won’t let her believe me, I’ve been doing research and trying to understand about her depression because I just want to help her be happy, I do what I can, I listen to her problems and try to offer some help here and there, but I figured I’d come here because if anyone would know how to help her it would be people who are affected themselves, it would be really appreciated on how I can make them feel at least a bit better."
Depression effecting work performance,3,mko206,0,"I have never been so depressed my work has been effected before. I always got glowing compliments for my job performance once I found a field that was right for me. But now when I have the slightest amount of free time at work. Which unfortunately I have a lot of, compared to my old job I can't go back to, I go stire crazy. Things that seemed fun before just seem like too much effort now a lot of the time. And I never feel like I have enough time to enjoy myself either even though I have a lot of free time. I waste it steering off into space now, missing my old job when I was always busy and missing having my own place. I so fricken unhappy, and the worst part is I know what would make me happy but I can't have that. I basically have to live with my boyfriend until we move. Him and his roommates. But I think I'm so use to living on my own that being around 2 other guys that consently want to joke about how fat you are gets on my nerves. I have no idea what to do. I really love my boyfriend but he doesn't want to get our own place and while he said I could have my own place if we don't end up moving out of the country that's a long way off. I'd like to be happy where I am now but the consent stream of you look like a man or your fat jokes from his friends is so tiring and they aren't you he kind of people that respect when you aren't in the mood for that. What do I do? Someone please give me some advice. I'm going to go crazy having a new job I hate and living somewhere where I'm so fucking unhappy."
I'm supposed to be happy but all I feel is apathy,4,mko0bh,2,"I've lived my entire life doing everything the ""correct"" way, I did great in school and got myself into a top 10 school for engineering where I'm 2 semesters away from a degree, but I just don't care. I'm an attractive guy in good shape with a beautiful girlfriend, but I just don't care. Everyone always tells me I have a bright future like it's all supposed to mean something. I don't have the energy to care about my future. 

&#x200B;

I keep working hard to succeed but only because I'll be bored if I don't. None of it means anything to me at all. I don't care about my degree, my friends, how much money I'll make or if I'll be successful. I just want to go to sleep all day. It's frustrated because what's the point to everything if I supposedly have it so good right now and feel absolutely nothing. I honestly can't remember the last time I was happy."
Advice i received from a therapist,5,mko090,2," 

Hello all. I hope all of you have been doing what you can to tackle your emotions. So recently I decided to bring back my dream of becoming a psychotherapist myself a few months back after withdrawing from my previous uni programs. I emailed my relative's therapist friend and after a few questions about my future career i asked him how one can deal with negative emotions like grief from a breakup or loss of a loved one. One good point he mentioned is that people underestimate the importance of grief. He said that people try to focus too much on moving on with little realization of the benefits hardships have to offer. No matter how big it may be, one needs to embrace and become one with his emotions. One needs to see emotions of hardship as an opportunity to evolve. He also said that a kind-hearted person like me, should I ever encounter a devastating situation, is to place a huge focus on helping others in need, such as helping the homeless or supporting those with addictions. He said that the potential reason why people still struggle on moving forward is because they focus too much on themselves during stages of grief. People, especially those with the kindest hearts, should place a certain focus on helping others in need. Sometimes, trying to please or improve ourselves only is not enough. We should place effort into pleasing our friends, family, and even strangers. This can even be simple stuff like baking a pie for the whole family, buying your dog something nice like doggy clothes, etc. Practice gratitude towards others. Give change to the homeless, try babysitting,etc. Not only recieving gratitude from others help us, but we also grow as people. Perhaps consider taking a flight to a developing nation and try your best to assist those people there!

Feeling less depressed,3,mkpyyk,1,After previously almost giving up on ever finding a job I finally got one had my first shift and really really enjoyed it 🙂 ☺
Lacking motivation to keep living,2,mkxsr7,1,"With the recent lockdowns I just feel like my mental health is just getting worse and worse to the point where everyday feels exactly the same and I’m starting to feel numb. I barely leave my room due to having parents with only one goal in life which it to make my life a living hell. I haven’t showered in almost 3 days because I just don’t have the energy to get out of bed. My attendance in uni is just getting worse and worse. My grades are also getting worse to the point where my parents are threatening to stop paying for my tuition. My friends forgot I exist and never talk to me unless I start the conversation, and even when I do start the conversation it feels like I’m carrying it all by myself and they rather be doing anything other than talk to me. 

I just don’t feel like I have anything to look forward to and zero motivation to keep going. Whenever people talk about their future plans and goals in life it makes me feel even worse because even now I still don’t know what I want to do with my life. I guess all I need is a goal or a target to try to achieve but whenever I try thinking about my future nothing pops up. I used to think I would probably kill myself before I turn 20 but now I know that won’t happen because I can’t bring myself to doing it. 

I honestly don’t know what the point of this post is I guess I just needed to vent and let it all out."
I made a poem. I’ve been struggling a lot lately.,6,mkm5s2,1,"Cleaning My Gun

Quiet whispers fill my desolate room

they speak of half-truths and grandiose lies,

whilst in the opaque darkness my heart dies

—ever bound to time’s harrowing doom.

The answer lay before me with a steel grip,

cool metal kissing life itself goodbye.

Enticing joy in its nitroglycerine tip

where all the angels and cherubim fly.

One pull to end these shrieking voices soon.

One flash to blind these failing ears and eyes.

One swift iron bird to this damned head flies;

Nil chance to see the flowers of spring bloom."
I actually fucking hate parents and their logic of “talking back”,217,mk1ad7,17,"I didn’t fucking talk back. I’m defending myself because I didn’t do anything wrong. When you say don’t talk back to me, that’s how a conversation works honey. Oh I guess I can’t reply to anything or else I’m being rude because god forbid I say anything in my defense when I haven’t done shit wrong. Now my day and pretty makeup is ruined and I fucking hate that because I was so excited to have a good day because I got to wear a new outfit and try on makeup for the first time. If you were wondering what I did, all I did was say: “why won’t this eye liner go on?” And “don’t worry I won’t be cold”. I fucking hate it here"

Do you think that mental health problems should be considered disabling diseases?,4,mkltuw,4,I think yes and I'm including also depression and anxiety.
does it end?,9,mki3s8,3,"this last few weeks have been some of my hardest rock bottoms.
from outside my life should be good.
but the fault lies in my head.
I've starting to realized I was suffering from depression when I was 21, and it took me four years to seriously looking for help.
last year, I also realized that I suffer of anxiety as well.
I've been managing to keep afloat, and honestly, this last 6 month I genuinely though I was going places.
but I can see how is so slipping through my hands now.
again.
I feel so empty, and this last few weeks I feel like I'm drowning. I feel so devoid, and I keep asking myself why?
I really can't see an answer to this, there is no why, no reason.
even if was to find a way to get back up on my feet and be happy, still why?
what am I supposed to do?
just keep working, eating, sleeping, exercising, get dressed every morning, or even dedicate my life to a project or a dream, it surely going to be interesting and excited for a while, but why should I go through all this effort? what for?
I felt so low last week, I gave myself a deadline - if I was getting better, if something would have changed, I should keep going, but if doesn't, then there is no point and I should just end it - and the thing I'm really scared of, is that I will reach the deadline, nothing is changed and still I will be to coward to do it, and I'll be doomed to keep living knowing I wasn't even able to do the only thing that would actually do me any good.
I feel like I'm wasting my life and at the same time I feel that I am so late already and I have hardly any time left.
but even if I do have time left, and I can still do and accomplish things, what's the point in that if I constantly feeling this way? and again, what's the point in general?
I don't even know why I'm really writing here, I know I need help, and I know I can't do this alone, but I also don't hold any real hope that this can get fixed.
this is been for all my life, an endless cycle of moment in which I felt better - and so they gave me the kick to keep going - but then, the true parts are is all the rest, where I'm drowning, and I'm empty, and I'm in pain.
does it ever end?
or is this I just how need to get used to live the rest of my life?"

I can’t keep up with college on online classes because I just can’t I spend all the time in my room alone but I don’t wanna go out of my room to my family, lately I don’t even want to eat, I oversleep and it this point I don’t know what to do.

I hate this job I have, the money is very good but I’m stuck there 10 to 12 hours a day, one week is days then the next week is nights I go home and basically shower then sleep then wake up for work again. Even when I’m having a good day I just have that feeling in the back of my mind that something bad is gonna happen or how I’m just not happy or how the good day is gonna end soon. I’m planning to go to school in the fall if I get accepted and that can’t come soon enough, but I know then I will constantly stress about not making money, I feel like my mind just constantly jumps from one thing to another of what to be stressed/ get anxiety about.

Absolutely fed up with working for assholes...,38,mkb8b7,15,"Anyone else getting FUCKING SICK of working for assholes for nothing? I know I am. How many of you were told before getting out of school that you’re going to have a blast starting your own journey and going through life? How many of you now realize that even the profession of the teachers that got you through school doesn’t even pay enough for people to life a good and happy life.

I went to college for a bullshit trade that I basically have to travel for if I want a job because the economy in my town is garbage, and all the businesses around here would rather hire friends and cousins and family of other employees, so finding a new job is a goddamn endless nightmare, just to get another bullshit job you hate.

Plenty of people will think or say “it’s not that bad, plenty of people have it worse than you”, or “oh suck it up, that’s how life is”, or my favorite “just write up a resume and look for something you like.” Everyone knows all this shit, it’s all preached by most parents starting by the age of 12.

I literally wake up for my soul crushing night shift and my first thought is “I have to do this or shit like it for 40-45 more years” and it brings me to fucking tears. The thought of dragging my ass out to my car and going to work for some rich asshole that would have me replaced fully within a week if I died tomorrow actually makes me physically ill. Back when my parents worked, you could find a job doing basically anything and be making decent money, or get into a field of work that today you would need a 2 year school course. Now you have to cough up 20k just to go to school for a chance at getting a job in that field afterwards. And guess what? YOULL HATE THAT JOB TOO.

It’s gotten to the point for me where sometimes I think the only way to get out of this godforsaken cycle of torture is to kill yourself or come across an absolutely monstrous amount of money. I have no idea how to deal with this anger and frustration, and I take it out of the people I love and care about. Can’t take a vacation because my job doesn’t do things legally and we barely get our scheduled days off as it is. Can’t look for a new job because I speak English in a mostly bilingual are where most of the good, high paying jobs are bilingual only. Like I just feel trapped. Anyone else out there feeling the same way?"
I can’t go back to work,1,mkx8oh,7,"Recently in the last month my depression has taken a turn and put me in a worse space than I was already stuck in. 3 weeks ago I continuously dropped a weight on my foot in attempts to break it, so I didn’t have to go in to work again. I’ve only worked once out of the past 3 weeks. The anxiety always kicks in the day I have work, then before I know it I get a strong urge to hurt myself badly. My minds just so split against going in and having to do an 8 hour shift in which I’m constantly upset, mentally drained and have panic attacks in the toilets. What do I do? I can’t see my psychologist for another month(it’s already been 3 months), I just feel like I’m constantly deteriorating inside and can’t go on much longer."

I need suggestions. Should I opt for antidepressants?,1,mkx1ml,1," 

I would really like to discuss it here before I reach out to a psychiatrist.

A year ago, I went to a psychiatrist who prescribed me a heavy dosage of medications. It included 5 different types of medications. The reaction I had to those meds was really horrifying. I couldn't sleep, I was literally numb and I just felt like a part of me had been just shut down. I was having serious sexual issues too. I contacted my psychiatrist but he didn't seem to care about any of this. He said it was normal, which it might have been but these things were too much for me to handle. I discussed here and people were shocked at why he would prescribe me so many meds all at once. The psychiatrist turned out to have a bad reputation for such things. I ended up going cold turkey and within some time things were back to normal.

Now, my problem is: I have anxiety and it gives me these sudden boosts of emotions, all kinds of emotions. I suddenly get really angry and stress seems to be just inches away most of the time. You can say that my resistance towards stress is very low. Like it doesn't take much for me to get stressed. That does not mean that I am always vulnerable, but you can say that stress catches on to me faster in comparison to others. I also quickly become mindful of my overwhelming emotions and can get things cooled down within 10-20 minutes.

I just get this sudden large supply of emotions as if a truck of this specific feeling has been unloaded. It doesn't just happen with sadness, it happens with happiness too. I don't know if it's bipolar disorder, but I was once diagnosed with GAD so I know for a fact that I have anxiety. It feels like initially, the dial for every emotion gets turned to 100, and then it slowly comes down.

Some time ago, I was also experiencing irregular heartbeats, shaky hands, fatigue, uncontrollable thoughts, concentration problems, etc. But I was also going through some relationship problems at that time, but when they ended, a lot of these symptoms came back to normal. My heartbeat got better, shakiness got better, but I still experience some of these and other symptoms from time to time.

I am not suicidal, rather, everything is going ok in life at the moment. But this sudden overwhelm and panic leads me towards embarrassment sometimes. For example, I might exaggerate something my friend did and after some time, realize that it wasn't that big of a deal and I overreacted unnecessarily. I can't just ignore something because my mind goes into this endless spiral, and in the end, It gets so out of control that I just have to let it out whether it's in a healthy way or damaging.

I have had very hard times in the last couple of years but things have finally started being well for me. I am grateful for how everything turned out in life, but this sudden overwhelm of emotions makes it hard for me sometimes.

My social life is also good and I have no thoughts of self-harm whatsoever. I used to be suicidal but not anymore. I mostly stay at home nowadays and don't do exercise that much so this could be a major reason.

I'm still really skeptical about antidepressants. But I'm also aware that my previous psychiatrist was at fault. And if my dose would have been lower or better suited, things might have turned out better.

But that's just a guess. The reason why I posted this in detail is that I want someone else to share their own experience. Someone who was in a similar situation as I am and whether the AD was really worth it, or if lifestyle changes turned out to help them get better without the aid of antidepressants?"
I feel weak,6,mkk44z,3,"I feel physically and emotionally weak. I haven't been getting enough nutrition and water. I'm addicted to sweets, which is difficult to stop because it relieves stress. Often, I skip dinner and go straight to bed after getting off work."

Now i was homeless and depressed so i slit my wrists to try and end it all, i was rushed to hospital and stayed there for a few months. In case your wondering where my relatives are during this my dads side of the family was caribbean so they lived there and my mothers lived in italy. I did small things for a few months after that, begging on the streets and mowing people lawns so i was able to purchase a small plot of land with a run down house, i lived there for a couple months with the windows broken and no mattress until i could afford to renovate it and i did after i got a job as an interior designer and got a massive loan from the bank, unfortunately after this my house burnt down and i was left in bankruptcy i can’t pay my debt right now and don’t know what to do? any suggestions?"
I need help to get help,3,mkp0yu,0,"I've been trying to reach out for help but my parents don't understand when I tell them I don't want to talk about the specific causes with them and that I want to go to a psychologist. Especially my mother looks at me weirdly and tells me ""I think that's strange \[that you don't want to tell me what happened\]"". They are disappointed because I can't manage to finish my final thesis, or clean my room, or other things I have to do. I've called a psychologist, which took a lot effort and a friend of mine videocalling me at the same time so that I wouldn't be alone. At least I managed to call, right? But my call went straight to voicemail / answering machine. I left my contact details and asked for help and they called me back a day after just to tell me they didn't had an appointment for new patients until beginning of July. And now I cannot push myself to call anybody else or ask my parents for help, just because my previous experiences have been so frustratingly unhelpful. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm in a really dark place right now."

A Technique that worked. Poppety Ping. PINGDITTY POP.,2,mkrof9,0,"I just wanted to pass in a technique that has had some benefit, especially if you catch yourself drifting into a bad way. I think I found on reddit possibly this sub. So of you feel yourself down and depressed, just say to yourself out loud, Poppety Ping, vlippety vlop. Boobetty boop.

"It's like a roller coaster, it gets better for a bit and then it's downhill from there. When will this hell loop end?",1,mkwnf4,0,"For the 3-4 years I have been getting treated, I have noticed a pattern that keeps on repeating over and over again.

I get better, my meds work perfectly fine and I start to make progress, but then boom. Usually nothing significant happens, but all of a sudden my mental health gets worse, my meds don't give me the support I need anymore and I just start to fall back into not being able to do much.

Right now it's the downhill part, this time a huge fight with my mom triggered this, I'm constantly anxious, I have panic attacks and flashbacks of all the trauma in my life she has caused, falling asleep can take hours, and I have nightmares and wake up in the morning all sweaty. I don't have the energy or motivation for school like I used to have (could be also the quarantine) and my free time after school is being spent trying to distract myself so the memories don't come back

It's been stressful for the entire family, my dad is tired and started getting help himself for mental health again, but more seriously, my little sister has fallen deep into depression, self harm and being suicidal, the whole quarantine thing is messing everything up and me dealing with not only my mental health overall, I'm trying to get an autism diagnosis which is hard, and my dads house reminds me of the emotional abuse that happened here in my childhood

I'm trapped, I can't escape and my life feels like a big hell loop that goes on forever.

I don't know what to do as everything I have worked for and everyone I love are crumbling right in front of me. I can't watch my family fall apart like this, but I have nowhere else to go. I can't move out, I'm a student who has no income and is unable to work. I'm trapped in this house that is a constant reminder of what happened to me and my siblings when we were young 

I feel so small 

I'm so scared if I fall apart I'll take everyone with me, but I don't know if I can do this for much longer"

"it's okay for me to cut myself as long as no one knows this, right?",1,mkvnb9,1," 

Self-harm makes me happy. Pain helps me to cope with my own feelings. I've never had any major trauma in my life. I've never been bullied, I don't have abusive parents, etc. It's true that I suffered sexual abuse from a close relative, but it wasn't as bad as what other people suffered, right? Like, it could have been worse, right?

My best friend's mother doesn't like me and forced my friend to change schools so she wouldn't be near me. I still don't know what I did wrong. Why doesn't she like me? I did something wrong? I said something wrong? She was my only friend and now I have no one. We can't even chat online because her mom blocked me on all social media. Hah, so many people going through difficult times and I'm crying because my best friend's mother doesn't like me. Pathetic.

I feel such a pleasure when I cut myself but I don't even know why, exactly. I can't describe what I'm feeling, I can't even explain why I started cutting myself. Nobody should be involved in this, right? It's my body and the only person being hurt is me. Why do they care so much? If I feel good when I hurt myself on purpose, isn't that a good thing? It's okay for me to keep cutting myself as long as no one knows, right? If no one knows it means that I am not an attention whore, right?"
Failed my attempt this weekend,3,mknkhm,2,"I was under too much to process. I ended up taking my entire bottle of antidepressants. I was found by my friends and taken to ER.

Now it’s been over 24 hours since I am discharged and I am unable to eat or drink.
I feel loner than ever before. I just don’t want to feel like this. I feel like I will puke if I eat or drink anything. It’s more than 72hours since I had anything. Is this normal?"
Dont think I can keep up this fight,1,mkviqf,1,"I have always suffered from depression and anxiety since i was a kid.
I never really understood why i always felt down and worthless struggle to make friends and even when I do there is something in me which feels it must self destruct and end any relationship I form.
I have suffered in silence for around 20 years letting this darkness eat me up inside and now I just feel hollow.

All this pain has boiled over for so long it has led me down a dark park and I well and truly have screwed up now, no idea what is around the corner in life.
For the last week i have finally admitted my problems to a few people but I fear it is too late.

I love my job but I may have lost that now the only thing that made me want to wake in the morning, I can no longer go home untill further notice so what is left for me.

All I want is a way to end all of this quickly and to stop being a burden on other people.
I cant get this dark cloud out of my head and can not clear the shame I feel and what I have done to my family.
I am sorry for the rambling I just had to find a way to get this off my chest I do not know how long I can keep up this fight anymore."
Happiest time comes after depression,4,mklcfh,0,"A few months ago I spent every single day on this sub, was diagnosed with severe depression, didn’t have a job, basically never left my bed and cried every day. I didn’t really know what was going on but it felt like the living devil was inside of my body. I shouted and prayed for it to be over. I thought I’d never make it out of there. 

I see a lot of people on here having exactly the same destructive feelings. Let me tell you why you need to be patient. 

After going through literal emotional hell I feel like new born. After months of feeling unmotivated and drained I see everything in color, everything is interesting again. I can finally see beauty in so many things I never saw before. I’m so thankful to be living on the most fascinating rock in the universe. I feel like I can do it. I have new dreams and everything I felt like giving up on now feels like as if I can do it if I just keep working on it. My most important takeaway from this horrible time is the fact that I actively wanted to kill myself. You might wonder as to how that can be a positive takeaway, but it’s simple: What am I afraid of if it’s not death? Exactly, nothing. So that means I can live fearlessly. I’ll give all I’ve got to achieve my dreams. There’s nothing to lose if you’re not afraid of death.

I still have days where the bad inner voice returns. I try to not listen and do things that distract me. Life is not easy. But surviving depression can make it a bit more beautiful in hindsight."

My dad is someone that always thinks he’s right, he’s so proud and super smart too but I think he uses that to manipulate us (me and my mom specially) so I have (kinda) the opportunity to get out again but this time my dad won’t let me come back never again unless he goes away, so... to not make this so long... there are good days and bad days but the mental health of everyone is there, the pressure and the constant stress is so common with my parents, so, should I just go now?

I would prefer just to do nothing at all and perhaps have some sex. But that is about it. No ambitions. No vision.

Degeneration,2,mkq663,0,"I feel a sense of degeneration in many areas of my life and do not know what to do.

During the coronavirus pandemic, so much just seemed to fall apart or get worse. After I recovered from a big bout of depression three years ago, I started excelling in school. This last year, all my classes were online. I went from being genuinely passionate about subjects, to wanting to just max out grades, to wanting to pass, to not caring and just wanting to be done.  I made bad mistakes at work and am falling behind in a class. I will almost definitely pass all my classes based on my previous semester work alone, but what comes after school in 3 weeks? I have lost almost all of my previous college friendships that I carefully built. I fear COVID and did not leave my dorm almost ever. I keep thinking COVID will get better in a few months, but a few months comes and it does not. I must leave my dorm in just a couple of weeks and go into uncertainty.

Family wise, everything got worse after my mom died. The glue that held us together. I have an alcoholic father who has what most people would call a major anger explosion every hour he is not drunk or asleep during the day. My little sisters act out horribly with friends and are barely scraping along in online school. My niece has an inoperable brain tumor. I cannot do anything about this. I have tried, but it always goes back to a bad state. You cannot fix a death or replace a critical broken part.

Health wise, I recieved very bad news from an orthopedist a couple of weeks ago. I am 22 with cartilage damage in my knees and a connective tissue disorder. People used to think I had a superpower with my ability to bend my joints, but now ignorance has turned ability into disability. I hurt myself, and cannot go back in the past to fix things. It tends to be degenerative with almost universal rates of chronic pain. I look into my future and think if I would want to be around anymore. I wonder if it is justified to quit if there is more pain than pleasure received from life. At what point is this? I have felt this way in the past. I set morbid deadlines for myself (e.g. I will give it one more month before being done), but I would always procrastinate until the next one or find a little something to hang around for longer. I have physical therapy tomorrow, and figure I can stick around to try it.

My relationships are pretty much gone. I just ended things with my boyfriend, who was one of the last things that made me happy. He was too much rolled into one. A lover, a best friend, 2-3 close friends, a brother, an enemy, an ally. I would spend 75%+ my social time with him. It is unfair to place the burden of an entire support system on one person. I went from being a good influence on him academically and socially, to being a destructive bad influence changing him. And I was slipping. Depression slowly absorbed my interests in music, history and political science (my majors) and now my love. One thing after the other slipped into oblivion. I felt I had to leave before I degenerated further. I hated the uncertainty of the future we had, but I still wonder about the future I have closed off. It would have gotten worse though. I feel like I have the potential to help others, but have mad eit worse so many times.

I look into the past and think of my childhood being near perfect. Almost idyllic. But everything seems to be objectively worse since then. Some of the degeneration is from forces beyond my control. Some of it is due to the choices I have made. I look into the past and see happiness followed by mistakes and feel remorse. I look into the future and see nothing but haze and thousands of scenarios. Some of these futures I am not in at various points. I despise uncertainty and it fuels my anxiety. I do not seem to live in the present. I know this is the best thing to do, it is what people tell me to do, but I cannot. Everything has the potential to get worse. To degenerate."
I'm sick of being told I'm negative,7,mkho6j,1,"Of course I'm fucking negative. Life has been shit, 10 years of depression and 3 other mental illness plus autism, getting severely bullied in highschool. Having to drop out of uni twice due to anxiety, the Rona, being an adult virgin with no social skills and hardly any friends
Getting abused by alcoholics at home, of course I'm fucking negative who wouldn't be honestly?"
Let’s play the wheel of depression!,6,mkigku,1,"Not sure how to engage with the depressed people in your life? Are they failing to respond to the wisdom and undeniable soundness and feasibility of your advice to just ""get over it""?
It's time to play....Wheel...of....Depression!!!! Simply write each of the words on the Wheel of Fortune wheel and give it a good ol' spineroo. Insert the word you land on into the following phrase: ""Oh, come one now! You're not 'depressed', you're just being ______."" and say it to the depressed person who is inconveniencing you with their CRIPPLING ILLNESS- selfish whining and moping all the time. Alright, let's spin!
*Stupid *Anti-social *Over-sensitive *Critical *An attention whore *Boring *Dramatic *Pre-menstrual *Self-centered *Weird *Young *Delusional *Crazy *Whiny *Bratty *Trendy *Lonely *Emotional *Short-sighted *Irrational *A party pooper *Self-defeating *Unrealistic *Stubborn
Extra points for a dismissive hand wave, air quotes around the word ""depressed"", finger-pointing, or the classic ""Sorry I'm not sorry for telling it like it is"" shoulder shrug. All the points for you and your bold statement of unfiltered truth, you edgy and unique fucking unicorn! Because negative, diminutive accusations are exactly what that person needs to hear right now. How do you win? Eh, really the depressed person just loses.

I'm at the brink of ending it all,1,mkv0cf,5,"So today me and my mom got into an argument
, all sorts of words appeard, but it's OK, the main thing is, that I went out of my way to say that I'm not perfect, and therefore I do a lot of mistakes, but BAM! Just because of that I'm a sitty person, of course, you see it from my perspective, but I feel like if once in a while I'm gonna be self-centered it nought help me, but no, I'm just a sitty person apparently, and the only thing that's keeping going forward is the fact that my will is made out of iron, but with iron will you can get so far, I'm not really sure how far I can go forward if even my whole family is turning their back on me. I don't even know if I'm pretending my own emotions, at this point. I'm I actually happy? I'm I just trying to survive? I just don't know at this point. I'm sure I will get over it, but will I choose the right way of getting trough it? I feel like I'm getting closer to being in a grave every decision I make.

""Mom, I've tried to kill myself "". I choked myself for a few seconds I assume and I didn't turn blue or anything, more like I wanted to pass out for some time and be fucking freed from my mind. I'm not gonna rant more about how hard everything is and just forcing myself to live takes so much energy, energy I don't even have I know she's gonna ask me about suicidal thoughts and attempts but I'm terrified of telling the truth, of being locked in that same room with people staring through that small hole and from seeing my mom cry after the physcologist telling them about my diagnosis It has only been a year, I should've done better and not have let anyone know but now it's done and idk what to say then"

"Slipping down more and more, need advice",1,mkuw4m,0,"Hi,

I'm a 26 years old guy and for the past year things have been getting worse for me, and especially so the past 3 to 4 months. I clean up my place less often, cook less and order in more, have little to no motivation to study and am barely going out and being active anymore. I don't know how to get out of this hole, is there any advice you could give me?

Anything would go, diet tips, planning and so on."
I don't know if I want to do anything,1,mkuvxo,1,"I am writing this post at 2am Indian time thinking about what the future holds for me. All I see is a bleak future with me being left behind and everyone else getting what they always wanted. I am a student of physics in somewhat reputed institute in India. I have always loved physics and always wanted to have a career in research in Physics. I have performed reasonably well in my semesters. But for the last 3-4 weeks I have been feeling very low about myself. It feels like I will end up messing up everything and live a below average life barely surviving. I think that I have never been good at anything. I lose interest very fast in most of the things that I start. As I am writing this post, I hope I am able to complete it before giving up on this post too. The only thing that has kept my interest up is my love for Physics and Football. Football has been my other interest as well. I used be a very good football player and I was very enthusiastic about football so much so that for 5 years straight I was the first one to show up at the football practice everyday. I always pushed myself to my limits, wanting to do better. I always contemplated on becoming a footballer despite my country not having any launch pad for footballers at that point of time. All of this ended when I graduated from my school. I knew that Football was maybe something I really loved but having a career in it is not something I can ever achieve. From here, everything started going downhill. I still had by love for science and physics specifically but I always could never live upto my own expectations. I had an ugly and toxic habit of comparing myself to others. The others achieved great feats in whatever Football but I could never do anything extraordinary. I always saw myself as someone who always put in extra effort to be at the level of others who didn't have any extra trouble reaching there. Same was in my academic career. I had to study an extra night to be the level of my fellow classmates. Still I would make mistakes in an exam. These mistakes had a debilitating effect on my self confidence. I have been getting distracted very much lately. The online semester has made my attention span shorter than that of a goldfish. Whenever I realise that I am losing focus I would start hating myself for it and then  slogged day and night to study subjects that I don't really if I like it anymore. I am trying to convince myself that I love physics but truth be told, I don't know if I love it and I have had thoughts of dropping out in my mind. But  that would be of no avail because I don't have any back up plan too. I still think that there might be some spark left to be ignited and all hope is not lost. But I am trouble in finding the math to light that spark up. I have been trying to aply for internships. I wrote to 20 professor all over the country, and none of them replied. Is it me? Am I really that bad at everything? When I put my thoughts into the retrospect, I see that all I have been is a failure. I have never been able to have a stable relationship with anyone. All of my ""friends"" ignore me. All the people that I have been attracted to have not reciprocated. All the hobbies that I have tried having ended in a week. At this point of time, my future seems very bleak and I don't what to do about it.




P.s.- I am sorry for such a badly composed post. I have had troubles in writing this. Hope you understand."
I'm scared of getting rich....,2,mkpswf,4,"I think about this everyday ""What if i got rich and still depressed?""

It scares me everyday the fact that I'm not gonna get out of this cycle scares me"
My current depression struggles,3,mkmr9f,0,"It's hard, getting up every morning. I no longer look forward to the day, but with my particular depression often it feels worse if I lay around too much because of having existential OCD, I have to find something to distract myself.

So I get up, usually around 10am, force myself to shower, brush my teeth, make breakfast. For me that part is not the hardest part, the hardest part is staying sane the rest of the day.

Having obligations but having zero motivation to get through them. Trying to make it through a homework assignments (I'm doing a Master's degree) but I have no drive or sense of urgency to get it done. That and the depression has slowed down my thinking abilities by like 70%, I simply can't focus like I used to and ideas just don't flow. It now takes a lot to get the gears grinding.

The worst part of the depression is feeling no connection to myself. Like the inside of me is like a big void. Even when people are jerk holes to me I have no reaction. It was only last semester that I felt on top of the world, I was passionate and striving to make a change in the world, but things changed so quickly over winter break. I myself am still trying to make sense of how my depression got so bad so quick. I used to wake up early in the morning 6am, I would work on projects, do homework, I was a super motivated individual. Where things took a wrong turn was I eventually became burn out near the end of last semester, maybe I over did it. Then the burn out lead to depression, then it became existential, negative thoughts piling one after another. As time went on it just got worse, feeling less and less like myself. Many times my existential thoughts have made me feel like I'm going crazy, this is why I need to distract myself all the time. For now it helps, but it's not where I want to be.

My depression tells me I am stuck like this, but I am fighting and holding on to the hope that one day I'll make it back to the other side."
i think i might be developing depression,2,mkpmuq,0,"it's been happening for a while, but it's particularly bad today.

for context, i'm a freshman in high school and i feel like my mental health is slowly going downhill. i have no motivation. i'm exhausted constantly and i just feel like i hate everything school-related. there's only one thing that makes me happy- a piece of online fiction that updates once a week. i feel as if i'm living the same day over and over and it's the only thing that's different. i'm tired. i'm so tired. i can't focus or snap my brain out of this haze.

to top it off, there's no way in hell that i'm going to tell anyone. i have issues conveying my emotions and problems to my family as the feeling of vulnerability has only ever made it worse. it feels awful- like i'm sick to my stomach just from it. i have two friends and they're both over the internet. 

i've started to worry a lot more about the lives of my family. i rarely ever worry about myself. i want to go outside. i want freedom. i constantly feel like i'm going to cry.

i don't know. part of me is worried that i'm one of those teenagers who fake mental illness for attention. it feels real to me. i've started to relate more to sad music, which i know seems trivial, but i never did that before.

i don't think i'm going to kill myself. i wouldn't do that to my family, but i have been thinking more about it lately. how great it would be to just disappear like i never existed. nobody remembers me, because i was never there. nobody mourns, nobody cries."
i wanna talk,2,mkpcrq,0,"so awhile back i decided fuck it maybe i should kill myself, searched how to make a noose and put it on a hook on  my ceiling and then i moved the chair and then i fell it didnt hurt everything was silent then bam i fall down and the ceiling is broken i sat down for a bit thinking then just started laughing it was really funny for some reason then i just slept some time goes bye and i hear that cutting yourself can give u a adrenaline rush that feels good so i got a knife and tried to cut my wrist and then nothing happened i pushed harder and faster but the knife was dull i tried against my throat but even then it was to dull so now i dont have the will to live but i also dont have the will to kill myself i want to know is this all coincidence or is there really someone watching over me"
I think I could use a human electroshock.,2,mkp6gq,0,"I have had this feeling of being stuck in inertia. Like wanting to move forward but not having enough motivation. It's my fantasy. Someone to come and push me. Put me electricity. Smiles, pushes, drags, sky and sun.

Someone who gives me a little rope to walk again. I shouldn't and know I should depend only on myself, but from time to time, one longs for it.

 I have to find a way to charge my battery myself. When I do I will completely forget about all this."

depression sucks,3,mkk5uu,3,"I don’t know how long I can take it here anymore. Im really trying so hard to stay alive but its just so freaking hard. I just don’t feel like myself anymore and my depression is getting worse and worse.

Saturday School,2,mkoxj4,0,"Preread: 
I’ve always had these, but have recently been having very very bad anxiety, loneliness, pessimism, and depression (including severe adhd) to the point of it paralyzing me so I can’t leave my bed some days. My school is also having “in-school” learning, which I think is absolutely fucking stupid, and I’ve tried to open up about my thoughts about it to my parents, and asked them to transfer me to at least “at-home” learning, but they said no, which is whatever. Also, this is a rant, it’s gunna be very mixed around, and I am horrible at segways, so yeah.

Anyways, I’ve missed so many days of school, and have been called to the assistant principal’s office multiple times, and now, just a few minutes ago, she told me that I will have to take 16 hours of saturday school, which starts when normal school starts. I also have 2 0’s in two of my classes, and failing 3 of them. And guess what? I COULDN’T FUCKING CARE LESS. I’m not usually a “rude” person, quite the opposite actually, I’m painfully indifferent, BUT OH MY GOD. Why don’t people just accept that some people can’t function some days, and just let them be? I wish that they could get a sight into my neurodivergency, but whatever. It’s all whatever, everything here is whatever. I hate making my own choices, so W H A T E V E R.  I honestly can’t do it anymore, not gunna commit the bad thing, because I don’t wanna hurt the people that “care”, but if (as cliché as it is) a car were coming at me, I wouldn’t move out of the way. I wish nothing mattered, I wish we could go back to being stupid meatbags that struggle through life through different means than that of fucking school. I hate life, love, and everything in between, but I still care for people that say they “care”, because I’m stupid. 

I don’t know why I made this, nobody wants to know. I dont want comfort either, nor attention, but whatever. This is the first of many choices that I am going to force myself to make, even if I delete it as soon as I post it. I hope you have a nice day whoever had the time to read this."
This is so dumb,1,mktx15,0,"TW: selfharm, suicide-ideation 

I spent the most beautiful week with my boyfriend, and today he had to go back to the country he works in and I won't see him until friday and won't have much time to spend with him because I have to work on fuckin saturday and I know I'm overreacting but like I wanna kill myself and THIS S U C K S. So now we talked on the phone for like 5 fucking minutes and now I'm laying in bed crying and contemplating selfharming because that's like a reasonable thing to do am I right? Lmao
This is so dumb I know but why does it have to feel like the end of the world just because I can't see him for 4 days I hate everything

I was so happy that week, I ate normally I was pretty happy I kinda felt normal and now I'm back at my fucking filthy apartment and I just really want to die"
"Everybody who is depressed (in my life), is functioning or has got better and I feel stuck and left behind.",3,mklpa7,2,"I have a friend with depression (she calls it depression, I dont wanna invalidate her but she isnt diagnosed). She studies (a lot), prepares in advance for exams and stuff, has a lot of self-confidence, is functioning well, likes the way she looks, dresses up and takes pics, travels and goes to restaurants and she is ""depressed"".


I have another friend (and I thought she was the only one who could understand me) who went through soemthing (idk what) and was suicidal and depressed, but her depression iss no longer there, (went away within a month). I opened up to her about my struggle with low functioning depression and my diagnosis of severe MDD and she said nothing. She said she was doing great herself and shut off the conversation.

These people who supposedly have depression, have experiences so far away from mine and I feel misunderstood.

I tell the first one about how hard it is to get out of bed and how my muscles have no strength on the worst days, and she doesnt understand. Uhhhh..... always so alone, no one ever shares the same experinces as me.

Forgive my spelling errors I dont care enough to correct them"
In a nutshell,1,mktqnd,0,"I have no drive. I want to be successful. I want to game and chat with people. I don't like what people are. I wish I had a best friend. My self loathing would come through. I have moments of clarity. I know what I want in life. I'm getting older and I have nothing to show for it. I sabotage every relationship and then bury myself. I don't like walking. I used to work out all the time. When I connect with someone there is always something in the way. I don't drink as much but my mental is getting worse. No matter what you say, to me there is a ""normal"". I want someone my age who gets me but I only want friendships. Asking someone to accept my baggage and still love me is hard. It's why I'll truly always be alone, no matter who is in my life. People always have hidden motives. Trust can't be truly given because why should i? I never show me though. you'll never get the real me. you can't handle it truly. it's a sad truth im living with. major depression. anxiety. anger. what's love? idk."
oblivious parents,1,mktq87,0,they will never know how much their actions hurt me.
Everyone hates me and are jumping to conclusions about me. What’s wrong with me?,1,mktmvq,3,"I posted what happened Saturday night and I got a lot of people talking shit about me and refused to leave me alone. They called me a pervert, a psychopath, and other horrible names. Then they accused me of spamming and reposting when I was only wanting sympathy. I told them exactly what happened, but yet they acted ignorant and started jumping to conclusions, like I need to be locked up, I was a whiny little bitch who is desperate for attention, a liar to make myself look better, a pervert who watches men change, etc.

Those were all false. I only want help. I’m tired of people talking shit about me like they think they know everything. In fact, I got trolled by several people, one is a flat-out bitch, another is a smartass. I had to block one of them already because she won’t leave me alone. I can’t seem to stop without thinking how much of a horrible person I am, how they’re right about me. Even worse, they tend to point out how I cry about people insulting me and yet they don’t seem to care about everyone feels but themselves.

I’m so sick of them all. I feel like I’m going crazy. Are they right about me? What’s wrong with me? Why do I feel this way?"
Can anyone offer me some pep talk?,5,mkjnlu,7,"I have not taken a bath in days. I spend more than half my day sleeping or lying in bed listening to sad songs. I eat a lot of processed foods. I keep drinking my sadness away. My homeworks are piling up I'm afraid I can't make excuses anymore.

Life is objectively not worth living,6,mkhfvk,1,"I've struggled with mental illness my whole life basically, having autism really sets you up for a miserable life. The one good thing I always had was family but that's gone to shit too, 2 members of my immediate family are alcoholics and one is abusive. I can't afford to move out because I'm in the last year of my useless degree. I have lost all interest in my hobbies, depression has kicked me to the curb then curb stomped me. I struggle socially due to autism and can't make friends, I basically rot all day in my room, I have been treated like shit my entire life because of it too. Why should I be forced to endure this shit life, because of selfish people who just want me to stay alive so I can suffer? It doesn't get better, I'm sick of hearing that lie repeated ad-nausem. I look at my life objectively and see nothing, I have good friends at the moment thats it, everything else is terrible, there is nothing to look forward to in the future except pain and misery. Death is more humane frankly."
Hi idk what to do,1,mktkd5,0,"I've been crying for the past 30 mins now. Its been like this for 3 night straight. Its been in my head since the past month that i don't have friends. Sure i call them my friends but i dont know if they call me one. I just realised this when i was really frustrated and just want advice from someone. But then i keep thinking that i would just disturb them and why would they give me advise on such things when they probably dont care about me. Yes I've been left out, yes it triggered my anxiety attacks, yes no one knows, yes i just keep it all to my self mostly. I don't know what to do. I keep telling my self its okay but clearly isn't. I'm exploding silently and slowly. I don't want to do anything. I don't have the energy anymore. I'm not the same as before. I dont know who i am anymore. I shouldn't be like this other people have it much harder than i am. Keeping up this facade. Lets just keep living till he tells me its enough. Family doesn't help either. They just.... I'm just a middlechild thats not important. Just have to squeeze in anything. Not always included."
Everything hurts,1,mktkbm,0,"Like seriously can I do anything right?

I want to sleep forever so I don’t have to feel anything. I can’t do this anymore."
My family (most of all dad) constantly ignores any boundaries I set and I don't know how to deal with it anymore,0,mktir3,1,"I (26F) had to move back in with family during the past year (55F and 56M parents, 18F and 21M siblings), and I thought I was mentally stable to take it on. I've had a difficult relationship with my parents in the past, we moved past it when I went to therapy about 7-8 years ago, it's been okay since. My mum tries to help me in her own way, which I appreciate, but my dad ignores it when that's most convenient. I don't even know how to describe it, but my dad is very self-involved, I would even call it narcissistic, to the extent that we always have to listen to him because he is ""very smart, much smarter than other people"" (literal quote) yet he will never, ever entertain an opinion different than his. He is always only looking for ways to boost his own ego and it is exhausting. I cannot hold a conversation with him because unless he can (1) show off, or (2) turn it into a monologue, he is not interested. 

As many here, I have troubles with staying interested in things - I used to have a lot of hobbies, I just don't anymore. I finally picked one up and have been doing it semi-consistently, yoga, and it is actually giving me some kind of peace. But I don't want to share it with my family because I know what'll happen - jokes, or my dad instantly saying he's better at it or making fun of me - which usually leads to me not wanting to do the thing anymore. Today I had a normal conversation with my mum about yoga, she does it, too, until she started asking which classes I follow. I have my favourite and I just don't want to share it, because last time I shared something about yoga my dad said 'do it now, so we can all laugh at you' followed by 'I'm better at it, do you know it's really good for you' and a lecture. I got defensive, because it feels like a test - I know this is partially my paranoia, but it felt like they were 'checking' I really knew what I was doing, because that has happened before - and while my mum said, 'but I'm not testing you', my dad just started shouting 'yeah what's the big deal with you thinking that, anyway?' and when I didn't answer he just said it again, but louder. He's the type of person to say - if something affects you, it's your fault because you 'let it affect you'. He's full of slogans like that. I just don't want to share my hobbies with him because he'll just bulldoze right over me, and I think I'm justified in that, but the last time I said something like that to his face he played the victim and ended up throwing a tantrum. 

I am so, so, so tired. I am a husk of my former self of a year ago, I am exhausted trying to finish my studies, and slipping back into a pit of depression. I just don't know what to do anymore."

They’re just giving me prescription drugs to elevate my serotonin level but their only advice to my situation in the community is to distract myself. That’s it.

However, I am doing fine now except to my social life. Whenever I tried to open up about my interest to other people and I told them that I don’t feel anything, they looked at me as if I am a psychopath. Their behavior and treatment towards me have changed. I don’t feel any positive emotions. Not even love nor happiness. I feel nothing. There’s no sparks or butterflies inside my stomach. But I am terrified to get attached with others except my grandmother and my brother. So, what is wrong with me?"

I want to know how they'll feel- will they even be sad? All I'd want is for them to give me some sort of self-validation with their negative emotions, but of course that wouldn't matter once I was dead. 

Maybe this is just my brain's way of a plea for attention- all I really want is to be able to sit down with my best friend before she moves away (across the country) and tell her everything, but I tried to do it before and she just called me a freak, before blocking me. I've considered asking some people how they would react/feel once I was dead, but I'm worried that they won't be genuine responses, or I'll get reported to a suicide tipline.

Can I take Passionflower and Antidepressants together?,6,mkh4v1,0,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5139955/

This study added passionflower to patients on the antidepressant SSRI Sertraline. There were no issues. I‘m on Amitriptyline 125mg at night. I don‘t know where but I read that Passionflower added to antidepressants can cause Serotonine Syndrome...? The study above tells the contrary. 

Maybe someone here who has experience with combining these two or knows something about pharmacological theory if it‘s possible or rather dangerous to combine them?"
I made a poem out of my situation and my feelings. What's your opinion? can you relate?,40,mk7vd4,3," **The Urging And Crawling Despair**

*A Poem by Noel*

&#x200B;

Whose despair is that? I think I know.

Its owner is quite sad though.

It really is a tale of woe,

I watch him frown. I cry hello.                                                                                                                                                              

&#x200B;

He gives his despair a shake,

And sobs until the tears make.

The only other sound's the break,

Of distant waves and birds awake.                                                                                                                     

&#x200B;

The despair is urging, crawling and deep,

But he has promises to keep,

Until then he shall not sleep.

He lies in bed with ducts that weep.

&#x200B;

He rises from his bitter bed,

With thoughts of sadness in his head,

He idolises being dead.

Facing the day with never ending dread"
Feeling extremely lonely?,8,mkfrjr,4,"I've been reading through this sub for around 2 years now but this is my first post because I've been feeling a lot worse recently. I act like everything's fine, and from the outside, people probably think I'm living a pretty good life. What hurts the most though, is having absolutely nobody who can understand how lonely I feel and the way I mentally put myself down. For years I've felt inferior and worthless, and everything I do seems to just be a distraction so I don't drown in these thoughts. I see people doing so many fun things, setting goals for themselves, making friends and dating, but I lay at night feeling empty knowing I get to wake up the next morning as a reject and outcast all over again.

What would honestly help a lot is just knowing that I'm not the only one. Has anyone else been feeling the same way? Love you all."
I’m so tired of my depression making me feel physically sick,5,mkj1h1,2,"I struggle with both anxiety and depression and was diagnosed a few years ago. I’m sure many of you can relate to how the pandemic has made my mental health much worse, but now I’m not only dealing with the crap in my head but also feeling sick almost 24/7. I regularly vomit and have nausea as well as an upset stomach, and my diet hasn’t changed so I know it’s not that. 

Before I started getting these more intense physical symptoms it was (slightly) easier to get on with my day - everything was just thoughts and not really physical unless I was anxious. But now I can’t do anything because it’s both my mind AND body now. I’ve called into work several times because I’ve been so depressed & anxious that I felt like I had a hangover and couldn’t stop puking. 

I’m not sure if this is normal, but if anyone has tips on how to feel physically better I would greatly appreciate it"
Need advise,1,mkss81,0,"I am suffering with depression all my life and have ptsd. I have tried  going to a psychiatrist for well over two years, but never really helped me. 

I dont se a point in life. I dont feel anything, beacuse nothing has real value to me. I just want to know how  to convince myself a good reason to live.


The only time i have feeot better is on drugs. Its the only time i really felt my emotions.

Im 20 years old for context.

My question: how do you get over this? Anything that really has helped? And what is your meaning to life?

Sorry for bad english. From norway"

Maybe,1,mkspyk,0,"Maybe killing myself wouldn't be so bad?  I would leave my mom a little bit of money and she wouldn't have to deal with me and my shit any more.  But then I think of how she is and how she would be sad that her daughter killed herself.  Like she was a bad mother and it was her fault, it would affect her for the rest of her life.  I don't want to be the shitty person who did that to her, even though I already am such a shitty person.  What's one more thing?  And I wouldn't actually have to worry about it anymore because I'd be dead.  That doesn't mean that reality stops, though, and I know that.  She would continue even though I wouldn't.  It's so weird how negative emotions push me to want to kill myself every day yet these negative emotions (guilt) are what's keeping me from doing it.  

I should do it.  It's logical and reasonable for myself and for everyone around me, but somehow it's also not just because.  Because my mom might be sad or feel guilty.  That's not a good reason for me to not kill myself.  Is it?  And Im more concerned about how I would be a shitty person for doing it to her than her actually being sad, and that makes me an even shittier person.  I don't want to be like this I want to be good and nice and happy and okay but it's never going to happen I'm just a shitty person"

Are suicidal thoughts supposed to always just be kinda.. there?,35,mk89pc,16,"Last few days been okay, not super depressed. But, today Ive been feeling a wee bit down. I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for several months now. They always just kinda seem to be there? Sometimes I'll be in the deepest pits of despair and want to commit but, like today, it was just kind of sitting there in my head. I was feeling a bit depressed, and the thoughts of just offing myself came through again, like, subconsciously. I didn't want to do it, but it was still there. Its like this, even on really good days, or neutral days. I dont want to off myself, but the thoughts still swarm my brain.

 Is this normal? Do suicidal thoughts just never go away as long as you struggle with depression? 

I would like to know other peoples experiences. I can't rely on anyone anymore, and so I turn to anonymous folks online. I feel as if i should tell my therapist this, but i dont think she'll do anything."

If depression isn't bad enough I look like im from 8-12 despite having lifted weights for years so no one finds me attractive. My social anxiety is so extreme. I feel beyond cursed, possessed. Deep down I've just felt like a higher power exists and just loves to fuck with me. People act like im delusional but I just say try living in my shoes. What if im actually right , and you're wrong ? Even if no higher power exists i still feel that way strongly. Ill be alone forever also , it isn't worth going to a hooker as they don't care about ya. I suck at everything in life no matter how much I've tried. People tell me to do shit but I don't wanna do anything. Pyschedelics did permanent damage too. Mental illness did permanent damage. I'm just tired of it. If suicide didn't hurt others I truly would brutally kill myself by now I think. I have no hope for the future im truly in hell of my own mind.

Sexual intimacy,1,mkrwum,2,Hi guys I’m fairly young teen rn but it’s legal to have sex and some of my friends have done it already and it scares the shit out of me. I kind of recovered from my depression but now I think I have ptsd?!! I was bullied throughout my whole childhood so that kind of fucked me up and I’m so scared of being taken advantage of again especially in any sort of way that is threatening or shit I’m just scared of men and just being intimate with someone now pls help
"Last year I lost my father, my grandparents. I still am struggling to recover and it's getting worse.",6,mki8vk,2,"There's still some really rough nights. I've always struggled to connect with people but now I feel like it's gotten more difficult. I worry I'm just an awful person. My father possibly died from covid and I would have been the only person to give it to him at the time. I can't help but think the last time I hugged him was when I broke down crying about having tried to kill myself and he admitted to trying the same years ago. It's taken so long to open up after other past trauma and just like my mother, he's gone before I could show him I've been trying. 
  
So I'm at a place now where it just seems like no one wants to connect with each other or we're all stressed out by it. Even my therapist had given up on me after 2 years of treatment. Nothing has helped. It's hard feel that connection. I'm dropping out of my grad program because I lost my connection to the department. I've not been able to keep up on the work and just find it hard to find that passion anymore. I don't even know what I want to do for work but I know I need to find somewhere to go live and work now. I just want to be left alone but I dread the loneliness. I feel like I haven't gotten anywhere is life for being 30 and still can't manage to hold work or relationships for more than a year.   
  
I partly dream of just giving up everywhere I own to just start walking till I find somewhere new or somewhere to die. I'm kind of good with either, I'm just scared to do anything because I just don't know anymore though."
"Depression Memory Loss, Other Memory Loss, or Just Bad Brain?",2,mkmprz,3,"Hi yall, I'm starting to get very concerned about my lack of ability to remember things, and I wanted to get thoughts on it. Has anyone has experienced similar? If so,  was it depression related or related to something else? I often have trouble remembering things (if I've told a story before, new peoples' names), but its becoming more and more concerning.

I've always had problems remembering names, but at this point its ridiculous. My mom has a biiiig family, and I only see them a max of three times a year, but I should remember their names by now. I forgot my cousin's name, her husband's name, and their second kid's name. I'm incredibly upset by this. There's another two cousins whose names I rarely remember.

I remember certain details of events, but not others. A couple years back I went to a baseball game during a trip with my parents, but I can't remember who else we went with, what city we were in, or why else we were there. But I can vaguely remember the route we took to get back to the bus, where we stopped for snacks, and the drive back to where we were staying.

Stuff like this happens all the time. Could this be a depression thing? Or should I get checked for something else?"

1 comforting thought,3,mki0sy,5,"Most things in my life are out of my control because of my depression and anxiety. I panic when i meet new people, I can't handle public places well, anything i do for fun I will doubt I'm good at if I make a single mistake. I don't know if I'll ever get married to an awesome wife and have kids to show all the cool things I know. I don't know if I'll get my dream car, build my dream house or get my dream job. One thing I know for an absolute certainty is that I will choose to kill myself. That is the one power this shit gives me, but that is my choice, for mine to make alone, even if others tell me too, it's not in there hands. Only I can kill myself. And I choose not too. And if I don't get anything I want, I choose to not let it win. I WILL BE THE ONE TO KILL MYSELF, and that will not happen anytime soon. Even though every fiber of my being wants to die, I won't. That is the power this gives me. I will be the one to kill myself. But on my own terms."
Not feeling very good,3,mkjnwb,4,I have been feeling really down the past 2 days and I don't know when I will feel better. I don't want my friend to worry but I don't want to burden him. We live in different countries. Should I text him to tell him I might not be in contact with him for a while?
What to say to someone who's depressed,2,mkme3v,24,"Hey all, so one of my friends is sometimes depressed and I thought it would be nice to send them messages twice a day ish just generally wishing them good health or asking them how their day has been.

I asked them if it would be something they'd like (I'm not going to start doing it out of the blue) and they liked the idea. So what kind of things should I say? Or does it not really matter too much?

Thanks in advance to anyone who replies. And sorry if this is against the rules in anyway, I've read them but don't usually post here."
This is the last time I am putting myself in this situation.,1,mkrh9f,2,"This is it. I (M20) have decided that I no longer want to live the way I have been living. Recently, my depression has gotten worse. It all started a few months ago when my grandmother was diagnosed with rapidly progressive ALS. Soon, she won't be able to speak at all. I have been depressed since Highschool, mainly due to bullying and the low self esteem that comes with that. My grandmother was and still is a huge influence on my life and I have a very close relationship with her. Although I'm not comfortable talking about how I am feeling with her currently, she knows that I am hurting which is comforting. 

However, even though I have accepted the fact that my grandmother is going to die within a few months to a year, it's making me extremely depressed and to be honest I am feeling quite overwhelmed. I tried talking about it with a few of my friends, but they basically just said ""That's fucked."" and left it at that, granted I probably didn't sound too upset as I tend to conceal my true emotions. 

School and Work definitely are not helping either, I work in a retirement community and seeing all of the residents there just makes my heart ache and reminds me of my grandma. School has been going okay, I found my assignments worryingly easy for me and thus I began to procrastinate as I shifted further into my depression. Although I get good marks, I am not happy with the content I am producing for my classes and am constantly critical of myself, I've lost countless marks for not showing up to present my work to online classes as I just feel like it isn't good enough. In fact, I am missing one as I type this. I've been barely eating, sleeping or taking care of myself in almost every capacity. 

But I've decided I'm not going to put myself in this position anymore. Instead of applying to go to college full time, overwhelming myself again and again I think I need to take some time. Most people say to keep going and just power through it. I'll be twenty soon, most people I've been talking to think it's too late to start college at 20. But, the way I see it is I can start whenever I damn well like to. I think I'm just going to work at a low income job, save my money, deal with my emotions and then hop back to it later. I don't understand why everybody thinks they have to get set up in life right away, and frankly it's annoying and makes me more depressed when people pressure me to do so.

Anyways, I probably talked a whole lot about nothing. Thanks for listening and all that you lot do on this sub. It's an amazing thing to watch humans connect like this.

TLDR: Grandma is dying, makes OP depressed, School seems to easy and makes me question if this is the path I want to pursue, job working with old people doesn't help the first problem. I'm gonna say fuck it, stop what I'm doing and reevaluate my life choices and do some deep thinking on how I am feeling."
A thread,3,mkjkw0,0,"Some days I don’t know what it is, maybe it’s a coffee or a cigarette. Maybe it’s a green of the weed bowl.  But all of this I’m living. It’s extra."
It's hard to be confident when constantly being rejected/ghosted,15,mkca6q,0,"I'm honestly not asking for sympathy as I'm way too drunk to care about that and in my own feelings but honestly. I've hated my appearance 85% of my life and in the last couple years I've been quite confident and working on my overall appearance and general attitude ngl. But honestly constantly getting rejected over and over not even able to make any solid connections, let alone hobbies or whatever it may be, there just seems to be an ABSOLUTE magical barrier. Even with fwb or anything because sexual or not I've been so alone I just would really like any type of personal connection.

But even with all this over the years, suicidal thoughts have been insane in my brain, but honestly they're not scary, or enticing or whatever. They're boring because honestly I'd like to live, but I want the pain to stop and everything in life I try to do to make it better hasn't worked. As of now I'm not going to do it as that'd be stupid in my head. But if I had a ultimatum to make that would stop me feeling like this by tomorrow, that'd be the only way I could see plausible. 

This is all now sounding really cringe but honestly it's how I feel and on a one on one talk with most this wouldn't be cringe but a serious talk so honestly I'm just venting on here cause I have no one to do this to."

i don’t know,1,mkr8ev,0,life is too exhausting. everything i say or do gets me in trouble or turned into a life lesson. i just tried to bring my dad outside with me and he ripped his arm out of mine and got mad at me. i don’t know what i did wrong i just wanted to spend time with him. i’m tired of trying to have fun with my parents and getting shut down. i just don’t understand what i’m doing wrong
so depressed,4,mkhr6b,3,"i just cant take it anymore. im so lonely, and drugs are the only thing that make me happy"
I feel that no matter what I do I’ll never be able to carry on like a normal human,1,mkr331,0,"So I have depression, GAD, ADHD, endometriosis, a connective tissue disorder, am a cancer survivor, and come from an abusive home.

The list just seems to get longer as I get older. Meds have never helped much with any of the above. I see a therapist, I’ve tried supplements, exercise, neurofeedback, you name it. 

COVID has dramatically worsened all of this for me. The uncertainty has created so much additional executive dysfunction and even paying my bills regardless of whether or not I have the money to do so feels like more steps than I can handle. 

I live alone and work only part time. I’ll be taking on more responsibility and hours in a few weeks but I am scared because of how easily I get knocked down emotionally and physically. I’m afraid I won’t be able to handle it. 

I’m also afraid I’m unlovable because of how dysfunctional I am. I am dating someone and I am fearful if he saw the days where I cry in bed and can’t get up for hours, he’d never speak to me again. 

Today my landlord did some work in my yard (my yard is private) and it’s in the lease that he sometimes goes over there to do some maintenance stuff. My yard is on a bit of an incline and I don’t often walk up to the top but apparently my dog has popped up there 5 or so times in the past few days since I last checked for poop. 

My landlord sent me an extremely aggressive message about how disgusting the yard was and that it looks like I haven’t picked up anything from the yard since I moved in (every few days I go out there). He said my dogs paws were probably covered in feces (they’re not). He said I am violating the lease agreement and he won’t be warning me again but there will be dire consequences if this happens again (he never has warned me before).

Now I’m so happy to work to be more diligent about picking up after my dog and I went right out there and cleaned everything up. With my health issues, I’m not always as present as I should be. 100% valid criticism.

I told him I’m happy to be more diligent about it and appreciated him letting me know. I also said I felt a bit hurt by the way he expressed this to me and that I didn’t mean to upset him or his partner (my other landlord is his girlfriend) in any way.

His response was that he didn’t care about how I felt and he said there was nothing wrong with how he expressed himself.

From there I just let it go but this majorly triggered hyper vigilance in me as someone who comes from abuse. My dad used to speak to me this way. I have been crying for over an hour now and I just hate that I get so knocked down by stuff like this. 

Like I said, I know he was within his rights to be upset and I should be doing better, but his words made me feel so afraid and unsafe. He lives in the unit next door and can see me from my yard so it took so much courage for me to even get outside to pick up after my dog. But I do want to say it was absolutely only a few days of poop. It was certainly not 45 days worth which is how long ago I moved in. 

I’m not looking for advice and certainly not judgment please. Just hopefully someone here understands how difficult it is to feel so triggered because of past abuse and mental/physical health struggles. I really wish I wasn’t like this and that I could just take the constructive part of his message and leave the rest. But it’s so hard for me to do that sometimes. 

Since picking up after my doggie, I made an appointment with my therapist and chatted with a friend. Now I’m just trying to allow myself to cry it out as that seems to be what I need right now."
"Feeling stuck, just need to vent",1,mkqufh,1,"I’m a senior in college who is working 30 hours a week and taking 5 classes. I’m so burnt out! I feel like I have no time but I could really use the money and I’m too anxious to speak to my manager about it...

I’m also realizing that I have been in a depressive episode for over a week now. I have not felt like myself in a while, but I don’t think any of it is bc of my medication. My appetite is shitty and when I’m not on my ADHD medication, I am so lethargic that I sleep through the day. I’m irritable and can’t hold a conversation and feeling awkward. This is so not who I am. I hate feeling annoyed by everything and having no motivation to do schoolwork. And I feel so lonely. I love my roommates and I have great friends and family. 

I’m extremely lucky, so why do I still feel alone and isolated? 

Why do I have no hope for my future, and why can’t I stop comparing myself to the friend of mine who is 3 years older, has all of the social and systemic advantages in his favor, and is going to Columbia Law? This is so ridiculous and embarrassing ahhhh I can’t believe I’m typing that out.

Side note, I wish my coworkers would stop asking me out!!! But I don’t know how to say no, and I don’t know why I can’t say no 😭

Maybe I’m smoking too much weed? it’s the only thing that calms down my physical anxiety and makes me feel social. I feel so shameful that I’ve been smoking once a day now. 

Thank you for reading, my mind is all over the place!"
How do deal with being in a relationship with someone who has depression?,2,mkliye,1,"So my wife has always suffered from depression/anxiety, I try to be empathetic and I've had my spouts of depression in my life so I get the feeling like you have no control over it. But I think me catering to her has made it worse over the years. We have three kids, I'm self employed and mostly work from home, and days when she's in bed all day I just take care of everything. So by me 'taking care of everything' she really has little responsibilities which over time makes her feel like she isn't needed and makes her depression worse because we are all continuing through life without her and she feels like there's no place for her. But she kinda did that by forcing me and the kids to live day to day without her.

And then on top of that, the last couple years it's been getting worse. Sometimes she'll spend 2,3,4 days in bed which fuels the above and makes us all even more independent from her.

Now I don't want to be upset and angry with her about it, I understand it's a disease and that we have circumstances that are also effecting it (lockdown, most of our family/friends have moved away, etc) so a lot of times I get through it by thinking to myself that if she wasn't here and I was a single father I would be doing everything anyway and wouldn't be complaining or be upset. So in my head I just think that, which just distances us further because I'm always just going about my life as if she isn't in it.

Not sure what to do at this point. If I talk to her about it then it'll just make her more depressed. And because there's not really a 'solution' it's like whats the point in addressing it.

Any advice or resources you could point me to?"
Damn almost cried at work,1,mkqk71,0,"I grew up in a house where my father would get tore down drunk and then yell at my mother or us kids because the house wasn’t spotless. Dinner was made, kitchen was cleaned up, dishwasher had been ran and then unloaded, dishes were out up, bathroom was clean, living room was clean, my sister and my room was not but whatevs. So he would yell and yell and yell. 

Well today my boss got really mad at something my coworker did. We all thought we were all on the same page from last Wednesday. Apparently boss man wasn’t. So my coworker did what we both thought was correct....it wasn’t. 

So today we get to work ACs in server room are not working so what’s supposed to be 70 degrees is over 100. The camera server crapped out again. The security pc crapped out again. And we couldn’t log into a laptop with the vpn that had been created last week. So tension is rising. And then my coworker told boss man what he did in Active Directory and the yelling commended. 

I literally almost had a panic attack and had to turn my chair around and do some breathing exercises to calm down. Luckily no one noticed this. That would have been weird had they. But ya so today I almost came real close to crying at work. 

And I’m on new psych meds and so I’m pretty bummed already. Not feeling great and I’m one small tear away from having to have rotator cuff surgery and it was a work related injury but I thought I just pulled a muscle so I didn’t do workman’s comp. so now 3 months later and finally went to doc I find out my bursa sac is completely inflamed and I have a gnarly tear on one of the tendons and I can’t afford PT or surgery so I’m doing at home PT and still trying to work cuz my dumb ass doesn’t have time to take off. 

This has been great!"
Films and TV,1,mkqgel,0,"Do you find that when you're in this downward spiral of sadness you're so numb you don't want to do anything whether the sun is shining or not. I can't help but think, if I was stood in a lovely scenic location why would that suddenly make me feel better?

All I find myself doing is staying inside and watching films. I was watching Cinema Paradiso today and the romance on screen was so beautiful it made me cry, not only just because I don't have that, but also because film is better than reality. You're seeing life with all the boring bits edited out. Life is long, repetitive, mundane and pointless. Just constant sadness and then as you get older life finds new ways to remind you how good you had it, until the punchline of death.

Why do people have children, when all they get is pain punctuated by boredom. I'm so fucking alone, I hate this shit.

Fuck it"
Back into depression 1 year after breakup,1,mkqett,0,"I don't know it this is the right corner of reddit for it.

However I just feel like writing it down, and maybe get some emotional support..

&#x200B;

I'm 23M and I struggled with a heavy depression before, about 6-7 years ago, mostly due to working a really bad job.

I'm not the kind of person to get help. I really don't know how I got out of it last time. But I just was eventually, I quite the job, and had people to kind help me through.

&#x200B;

One of the people would become my GF for 5 years. It was a long distance relationship it wasn't the best but we loved each other very much. I took the relationship for to granted, and I think I was just to young to figure out what I wanted in my life and couldn't decide how important she was to me.

So we broke up about a year ago, after she told me she felt trapped, and that I wasn't committed enough. However the bad things leading to now just began.

Due to us being best friends before and texting daily for 8 years we just continued.

This lead to me not realizing that we really broke up. And me logically mind knew, having her reasoning behind the break up in mind that I wouldn't be a good thing for us getting back together.

So when she tried to get back to getter multiple times in summer of last year I rejected her. Having her best interested in mind.

In Winter we texted less and I had a vacation from my very demanding job and got to thing about life.

Figured out that I'm a foul. That I gave away a great thing, and that I just should have done more.

Guess what - when I told her all of that she told me that she had moved on.

However I kept trying and reestablishing a relationship. We began spending more time together (online) and again talking more.

Looking at right now: she had her first date 2 days ago, and it sounds like she spent the night which just destroys me.

&#x200B;

I also tried to move on. But it doesn't seem to work. I cant stop thinking about her. And the bad thing is that we are still texting. I know that this part is so stupid. But I also feel like I just cant let this person go. She was such are integral part of my life for sooo long, at such a young age.

&#x200B;

And all this leads to the depression part. Which is the one I'm really struggling with.

I think I got a low key depression for a while now. Maybe for over 1.5 years. Meaning that I cant enjoy things, cant concentrate on small things, am restless all the time, and just don't feel happy. Also my current job just isn't as satisfying as it used to be and a lot of people I liked at work quit during corona. I cant excise any of my hobbies at the moment due to everything being closed due to covid, besides gaming. I do enjoy gaming while I'm doing it but afterwards I just feel guilty about wasting time.

&#x200B;

I just feel like I'm never going to be happy again. That I will die alone, that I wasted everything, and the only one who is to blame is myself. The depression hits the hardest at night. I cant sleep. I just don't want to endure it anymore, and I don't know how to get out of this. I have no one to talk to about this. My friends just make jokes about those kind of things, same with my family. I'm also super uncomfortable talking about my life to people that know me.

&#x200B;

Of course my conscious mind knows that I will eventually get out of this. That depression is temporary and life can be wonderful. But this of course doesn't do shit for me right now. Everything just hurts. And I feel alone and awful. I try my best with the run of the mil Antidepressant tools like: exercising, eating healthy, going for walks and taking vitamin D (Which helped a ton with seasonal depression which I also experienced a couple of times.) I think my only option is to suffer though it and hope for the best that I doesn't get worse.

&#x200B;

I know that here a people who have it so much worse than I do. And I feel really bad complaining.

&#x200B;

And I apologize for any typos, spelling or grammatical errors. English is my 2nd language.

&#x200B;

Thank you for reading if you came this far."
"It seems much of my depression was mostly situational, but didn't fully realize it.",28,mk7sin,8,"I recently got a job at a private airport, and I do various things, such as assisting mechanics, processing plane rentals, etc. There are a lot of people there that I can really relate to and have conversations with about technical stuff, plus I feel like my life is moving forward, and overall it is a very interesting job.

I would used to go to bed feeling empty inside, and I generally didn't find much joy in life, but now I don't have that. I think my depression was mostly caused by a lack of joy in my life, and I just couldn't fully directly correlate it. I still use dipping tobacco, which I noticed can boost my mood and get me motivated, so I don't know if I am still partially depressed. 

I just wanted to say that. Maybe my simple success can help others here."
Just wanted to share something on my struggle with depression.,6,mkfczr,1,"I hope this true story helps explain whats happening with me:
Many years ago we had these neighbours who kept two family dogs. Unfortunately for the dogs, when our neighbours moved out of the house they chose not to take the dogs with them. As the years passed those dogs relied on the scraps of food we gave them, and 'food' from rubbish bins. They grew old, sickly, and one of them appeared to have cognitive problems too. One day, one of the men from that family came back to the house to look for something, and those two dogs despite being very old and grey and weak ran like they were puppies towards their old owner.
 I wasnt there,but my mother said their loud cries sounded almost like people crying. The man(our old neighbour) disagreed with us when we told him that the dogs needed him, saying ""oh they ran towards me so strongly, they appear well enough to look after themselves"".


I reached out for help for my depression, i fear im relapsing. But i feel this sense of complacency whenever i actually get help  Complacency that is ruining my recovery.
Whenever Iam in the therapist office I feel So happy and grateful(for being there) that i almost cannot remember the abuse i receive from my family and relatives. Therapists expect to see a sad miserable helpless looking person for depression, who can tell them all about their miseries - but thats not what happens with me.  I feel so full of gratitude that I cant express the reality of my suffering accurately.
People say 'oh you look so good and happy, im certain your not actually depressed' ""oh your mother looks so sweet she cant be verbally abusive or emotionally manipulative""

It leads to the therapist not accepting i have depression or aspergers. Ive seen dozens of therapists, and i dont want another one to fall ignorant to my 'hidden' sufferings."
I miss myself,10,mkdimq,4,I don't want to feel all of this. All my life I've always tried being a good person helping others. I don't know what wrong did I do to deserve this. I just want to be happy again. I want to feel proud of myself. I want to prove that i'm not a mistake. And knowing the fact that I can't be how I used to be kills me. I feel like ending all of this. I just don't want to feel any of this.
Everything in my life is going wrong.,2,mkkw1x,2,"But that's okay. 

I don't care at this point just hurry up with me universe."

Constant Loss Of Appetite?,1,mkpq63,0,"Hey all. Im 24M. Had 27 test as Im hypochondriac and have heavy health anxiety, so my story is since august of 2020, I have less or no appetite.... Does it normal constantly? I diagnosed with  depression and anxiety too, so any words much appreciated!"
Trouble Maintaining Erection on fluoxetine,1,mkpdtt,0,"I've been on Prozac for around a month now. It's been rather tough maintaining an erection as well as attaining orgasm. This has been rather frustrating, so I've begun tapering it out over the next 2 weeks.  


Will these symptoms last? I'm scared this will have a permanent effect on my sex life. I've heard that those permanent effects usually only happen to those on antidepressants for years and years. How can I manage this?  


I guess I just want to hear that this issue will pass."
UGHHCICICJ I JUST WANNA GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE 😀😀😀‼️‼️,3,mkgo7b,0,I want to get out of this literal body and just fuck off from everything including myself. I hate this place hate everything hate this country hate the weather omg why can't it all happen already why do I need to take time HOW MUCH MORE TIME DO I NEED IVE BEEN HOLDING ON FOR FUCKING YEARS . I can't fucking stay like this even for another year or months the fuck. I'm turning 20 and my life hasn't even started oh my god. Ok honestly I just literally want to fucking kill myself at this point I'm so fucking done
I just want to tell you it can get better,18,mk9p1e,1,"I spent most of my teens and 20s suffering from severe depression (along with anxiety and a variety of other ills). I never thought it could get better, because experience had shown me otherwise. I was in the dark for so long, I really thought I'd be dead before 30. 

Well, my 30th birthday is in about 6 months, and I just want to tell you there *is* hope. Even if you don't feel it right now--even if you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel right now--it is there. Today, a song from high school came on in the shower and I cried, thinking about how far I've come since then. I've spent many years in therapy, and take multiple medications. There is no shame in seeking help. I no longer constantly want to die. I really thought I always would.

I'll never say I have it all figured out, but I definitely have it *more* figured out than I did. It is possible to get better. It is possible to learn how to tolerate your life, and yourself. **You have worth, you deserve good things--love, friendship, accomplishment, moments of peace. Don't deprive yourself of them because you don't feel good enough. Try to be kind to yourself, even when the depression tells you not to be. Have compassion for your suffering, and forgive your mistakes. You're just an imperfect human like the rest of us. It's going to be ok** <3"
Feel like I've let my parents down,1,mkokk8,4,I turned 33 last week. I'm unemployed with two degrees and no direction. I never really made the transition to adult life and I've been lost ever since.
My mom is depressed,2,mkjn22,3,"My moms been depressed my entire life, and I on my own can’t help her anymore. It’s caused me to feel depressed over the years and I need to heal myself before I can help anyone else. I just feel horrible, because I know she needs the help."
Sometimes I wonder if my depression and breakdowns really are self-inflicted,17,mk9cl3,2,"I feel like I choose to think about things that make me sad, whether it's music or something I'm worried about or something that happened to me in the past or that I did or said to someone else. I cry almost everyday and sometimes three or more times a day, but I feel like I shouldn't be. I'm about to graduate college and I've got a few things possibly lined up for right after that, but I'm not looking forward to any of it. I just feel so overwhelmed and tired of it all..."
Tired,6,mkec98,3,"I pretend to be happy around everyone else so my problems don’t become a burden on them, No one ever asks me how i feel and it’s always me to be the one helping others but they tell me i suck at giving advice and never talk to me unless it benefits them

I just wish I had real friends"
"I'm so damn aimless, everything is hard and bad to me...",1,mkoc4n,0,"I don't know where to start honestly. I keep thinking that I've been born in the wrong life or something. Nearly everything is just bad or hard for me. My body is a cunt and loves giving me pain every day for no apparent reason. I'm relatively close to finishing school, but before me comes by far the most difficult school time of my life for like an entire year, pretty much all of my friends annoy me in one way or another, I'm constantly dealing with porn addiction and beat myself up mentally whenever I fail. I love physical work, the gym (which is closed thanks to covid) was pretty much heaven on earth for me, the thought of having a simple, manual labor job is great to me, but everyone in my family, friends etc says that I have to finish the highest form of school where I live, and I just so happen to live in a country where the difficulty of school is utter bullshit (and that's a well known fact where I live, not something that I only perceive that way). I keep wondering, why even do all that? I don't need a huge house, the best paying job, the highest rank in society. I just want to live peacefully, honestly a minimalism lifestyle appeals a lot to me. I'm so damn unhappy with my life, nearly everything seems to work against me, and I'm just tired of having to care. I'm not suicidal at all, but I sometimes feel so dead inside."
Struggle,1,mkoaed,0,"So kinda fell into this recently. Was in an ok but lack luster relationship. Ended that, my choice. Going back to trying to work on myself but I have no motivation. Hurt my knee and my arm. Now I can't even do my favorite thing which is disc golf. Been drinking to much, to the point where I can't remember parts of the day. I pass out mid day and wake up later. I know what I need to do but again, no motivation at all. Want to be alone but don't want to. I feel the worst for my daughter who I have for half the week every week. I love her but every weekend I have her and no break. Idk, just rambling and I have no direction."
Dilemma Update,1,mkoa8b,0,I have felt pretty normal over the last couple of days. I want to go see someone but I also don’t want anyone to know because this wouldn’t be the first time I seen a professional for this.

"How should one cope with emotional and psychological abuse? How can I deal with this endless cycle that is constantly keeping me anxious and afraid of anyone, I feel like a living corpse because I can't express my negative emotions to my abusers and am a constant victim, what should I do?",1,mko8pi,4,"&#x200B;

Usually abuse is looked over when it is not physical. I sometimes wish my abusers could break my legs so I could be taken seriously. What messed up my mind was none of the insults I was called and it was not none of the slaps, punches and kicks I took. It was the threats,ignoring,glares,fits of rage, gaslighiting, isolating me. How can I ...cope with the past and deal better with emotional abuse in the future. I feel constant anxiety, as if it would happen again, for whatever reason people always choose me as a victim/scapegoat for their anger and scream at me, project hteir insecurities onto me. I don't know what am I doing, and what behavior is attracting these kinds of individuals, I sometimes feel liek I have to set strong walls around me and not let anyone in since even small empathy attracts bullies

I have physical symptoms due to repressed anger and bullying in school, I went to all doctors and they told me I am healthy, so it was psychological. I want to take off my anger on people who deserve it, those who abuse me, not take it on people who don't deserve it-my parents, hearing me scream. I am usually really quiet, overly polite and nice person but I have never been respected. It is is like two people exist in this world - moronic dumb agressive people who teach you to fear them, and nice people whom no one respects for no reason, despite them being agreeable and doing everything, no one respects them, which is weird. The so called assertive people seem to be really rare. I want to become assertive because I can't really be agressive, I am so emotionally raped that I can't even scream anymore. I just, I just want bad people to leave me alone and people to respect me. I literally don't know what am I doing wrong with my behavior, is my body language bad, is it my empathy, is it my overniceness? I read many articles on why people attract bullies and they all give different reasons. I feel hopeless and don't know what to say anymore.

I don't know what is true and what is false, it seems like bullies only respect those dumb kinds of people that are agressive like them - i think people think they may have confidence and stand up for them selves due to the pure agression when in reality they are just assholes. Mature people are quiet and kind but people think I am weak. I want to stop being vulnerable, but as long as I am human, I will be vulnerable, however I want to change my self in a way that will say - hey, she isn't inferior, so I won't bully her. For whatever reason people just decide to bully me. I always blamed my lack of friends and mental illness that causes me to be overly emotional over little things, which I still am, I can't correct this trait, so I really try to not be reactive...the problem is that in school usually the bullies forced me into a corner until I couldn't help but react, so whether I reacted or not, I was bullied anyway. I don't understand how people once decide they hate me and then literally judge everything I do. - I remember being bullied for drinking water and literally breathing once in 10th grade, I don't know why someone could be so petty.

TLTR: How can I stop the cycle of bullying and become like one of those people that are usually not very smart but are brave and can stand up for them selves and command respect. Please don't tell me - BUT YOU EARN RESPECT- becuase you don't earn it. No one earns it. From my experience, only the more dumb and agressive people who fought were respected and nice people like me were just bullied. I would like to become more proactive, responsive and less reactive and emotional, how can I control my anxiety. I sometimes feel like I am doomed to constantly be bullied, since it is an endless cycle, everywhere I goes, there is always this group of assholes that size me up as a girl, and since I am not naturally sassy and outspoken and am quiet, they take it as having no confidence."
Question,1,mko70n,8,"Anyone know how to push away deep conflicted feelings, I’ve done it for a while but it’s come back, I’m to young to drink, I try not to think about suicide and idk what to do, I’m not very emotional around people but I kinda want to forget I’m alive you know?"

I care so much about the people around me and I can’t even care for myself.  It’s not that I can’t care for myself, I choose not to.  Every night, I brain forces me to relive past horrors and I can’t do anything about it besides watch as I views terrible memories like a movie in from of my eyes.  Every fucking night.  I can’t stand it anymore.  People told me things would get better but they haven’t.  Started at 11 and now I’m 16, it’s been five fucking years.  I hate life.  I through with this shit.  I just want someone to be there for me, to love me, to understand me.  I’m too shy to get a girlfriend.  I can’t get myself to do shit.  I just want all this to end, but I don’t have the balls to do it.  I am too scared that if I tell my friends about my depression they will leave me.

The psych Dr told me he didn't think I was depressed. I replied because I have bpd. He didn't offer me anything but a pamphlet for home treatment which since my multiple recorded comments about suicide haven't made any contact with me. They don't care. They don't think I'm a risk. Maybe they don't know me at all. Maybe it's me who has it all wrong parhaps my over welling sadness and feeling of being constantly tortured in the living life are false.

Doing nothing is scary,2,mkiy73,1,"So I’m an alcoholic, I drunk to treat my depression and anxiety. I stopped drinking six years ago, because I had so severe withdrawal symptoms, I had to be in the hospital for a week. After it, I started my own business and started PhD in history. Nearly all my depression and anxiety connected symptoms are gone. My last six years was very busy, I had a lot to do every day. On Friday I started to feel strange, it’s probably COVID but I will be tested only tomorrow. So I’m at home alone since Friday and my only task to do is to recover. It means lying on my bed and watching TV, because I feel pretty bad and I don’t even have energy to read a book or anything else. Yesterday my depression symptoms appeared, I feel useless, I’m ultrasensitive again.  The weather is beautiful, but I feel I just wasting my time lying here and I’m just cause problems for my family. I just realised that maybe the only reason that most of my depression and anxiety symptoms are gone in the last years is because I had a lots of work and I was always too busy to care about it."

I just feel so empty. The fact that I will never see her face again is still unreal to me. Just three days ago she was here with us and now she’s suddenly gone? 
She was so helpful, a great person and helped me feel less alone.
I still don’t know why. What was so painful she had no other way out? I don’t think anyone knows.

I have been nothing but a sex toy all my life. I'm done.,121,mjwen1,44,"I'm done, my only worth is to give guys sex. It's the same song and dance...

Pretend to be mad when they hear how men have treated me in the past 

Pretend to be vulnerable with me

Then the sex comes in and the whole veil drops, they may come back for more sex if desperate otherwise I don't exist anymore 

I'm done. I will never amount to anything more than a fuck toy men use out of desperation 

They openly tell me they can do better and can get better than me....I should be grateful I'm allowed this much affection

In a dark place,4,mkfbz5,3,"TW // mentions of suicide, suicidal ideation

Lately, I (22F) have really seen my depression come to a new low. I've been diagnosed for about 8 years now and have been on meds for that long though I suspect I was depressed far before then.

There's not much to this other than to say that while I've been depressed for a good chunk of my life and have wanted to die, I knew that I could never do anything to myself. I knew I'd never be able to commit or even attempt because while I crave death I also fear it.

In a sick way, I hate that about me because it makes me feel like a coward. I feel like I'm too weak to be able to even do the one thing that I want or that would end my pain. I know it doesn't make sense and it's fucked up but I don't know how else to describe it.

just wondering if anyone else has experienced this too"
How do you handle lapses? How do you own up or avoid them?,1,mkn57a,0,"I'm in the sixth week of my first full-time work and unfortunately, I've also just restarted my medication after three weeks of running out. 

My immediate superior has been concerned since the second or third week of my job because I've had lapses: failing to log-in or out and submit my End-of-Day reports, failing to perform small daily tasks, sending in task submissions late, and at times not sending them at all.

My superior has been one of the most patient bosses I've ever had (only five, really). He started meeting with me weekly since my third week to plan out my daily tasks. When my personal laptop broke down, he got me a work laptop in just a couple of days.

On my fifth week, I started really breaking down (the second week since I ran out of meds). He met me online and asked why I was underperforming. At this point I finally opened up about how badly my depression was affecting my performance (I informed them about it during my application), and we set about making my tasks more manageable. He also talked to management about enrolling me in their HMO (which I'm actually not entitled to yet because I'm still a probationary hire). He also reached out to his own friend to get me a prescription in the meantime because I can't afford a psychiatrist appointment. Then he told me to rest for the week because we had a long weekend from holidays anyway.

Today was my first day back after that break. We set expectations again, and I was supposed to handle one of my regular tasks (updating and adding shared content to our social media accounts) alongside one deliverable per day. Unfortunately, I lost track of time and failed to deliver again. He's told me about it and said that while he understood my situation, I have to respect our agreement and not disrespect him. 

I understand. They hired me because they're severely understaffed, and without me, the work would just be taken by my immediate superior. He's also gone out of his way to provide support even though I'm just a new hire.

So the questions are: how do you handle lapses? How do you move forward if they happen? How do you make up for them? How do you avoid them? How do you keep track, and remain consistent? How do you pick yourself up after a stumble (understatement, really)?"
No body really cares about anybody do they,12,mk9k56,1,"I really want to get out of this depression state I'm in its exhausting, why do I care so much about everyone around me but not a single person even my own family cares enough about me to ask how I'm doing"
"Guilt, fear and depression",2,mkihpl,0,"I've been going through an intense period of guilt and shame. Shame for who I used to be, for things I've done and mistakes (not all I could help or prevent) I've made. I feel guilt for hurt I might have caused, for damage I might have inflicted and for what I now see as lapses in judgement. I'm unsure if I remember these things correctly, as they caused little to no depression or hurt at the time, but now they loop through my head with painful regularity. It's starting to impact my ability to function. I stare back at the recklessness with which I lived my early 20s and shudder with both shame and regret. I also feel that people will remember or find out about these instances, and my life and relationships will fall apart. Most of these things happened 6-8 years ago.

Many people see my as a good person, but in the regard I feel I'm a fraud. For reference I'm diagnosed as a depressive and take medications.

I'm looking for tips to overcome this phase of crippling, obsessive rumination. Anybody been hit by something similar and managed to beat it?"

Losing interest in everything,6,mke6v9,2,"This is the third time I've struggled to write this in the last week. 

On a downward spiral at the moment. I'm struggling. Struggling to be who I'm expected to be. The work colleague,  the husband, the father, the friend. 

My temper is out of control. I'll fire up to 11 over spilt milk. I'm constantly yelling, looking for fights. Aching for someone to look at me sideways. I feel like everything I've ever loved has either been taken away from me or is leaving on its own accord.

I feel like I'm constantly being put on the back burner,  my needs, my feelings, while I hold everyone up on a pedestal around me. Trying to make others feel good and give from me to them to fulfil theirs needs. Especially the kids. But I'm struggling to love lately,  struggling to find happiness with them,  all I do is yell at them. 

The things I use to enjoy being me no happiness no more,  no joy, no elation. In a house full of people I love and things I use to desire,  but feel so empty and lonely. Not lonely enough to want company,  I'm beyond that, I don't care for it. I don't even want to pat my little dog any more

I don't want to be any more. I am tired of having to be. I'm tired of everything"
I hate being depressed and horny,5,mke2vb,0,The post nut clarity hits harder than ever. But I really need that 2 seconds of happiness.
hello.,6,mkd7pj,2,"hello. I know there are many posts on this subreddit, but I hope if you are already reading this, you will stay.

I’m not sure what’s happening with me, but I’ve been this way ever since I was a child. My childhood wasn’t amazing, I had to live with a manipulative and mentally (sometimes physically) abusive mother up until I was 16. I’m now going to be 21, and if anything feel as if I’m in a worse place although my relationship with my mother is the best it has ever been. I always thought perhaps she was the reason for my depression, and that not having her in my daily life would be the answer.


I’ve accomplished many things since I left her home, but truly I’m not interested in anything or have any goal that I want to live towards. I’m in school, for once in a good position (shelter/food wise), and have a girlfriend and friends that love me very much.


I was begging for these blessings before, because all my life I felt that with them I wouldn’t feel like I needed to disappear, that I am too sensitive and this world wasn’t meant for me, and still to this day I feel the same way despite having the care and resources that I wished for.

Although my depression has gotten better, the never ending feeling of I wasn’t meant for this world is still here. I still have terrible days where I can’t leave my bed and can’t control my emotions, but for the most part I’ve been taking care of myself and trying to be more optimistic. Even while being optimistic, I still feel like this is not going to stop.

I feel like saying I want to d-e is more hardcore than what I really feel, when I just want to peacefully pass away. I don’t want anymore pain, I don’t want a sad ending. I want to be able to tell the people I care about that it’s okay if I leave because my soul wasn’t ready to be in this world, and hopefully in another lifetime it will be.

The only thing keeping me here is my 1 year old dog who is so amazing and loves me so much. I will miss her the most and cry at night thinking about how much she will miss me.

I’m going to give myself one more chance and try to find meaning, or whatever else it is that will make me feel comfortable being here. Thank you if you read this all the way through."
Waiting for another day to be over,8,mkbqmk,5,"Everyday it’s the same. I do what I can to pass the time, but there’s nothing I really want to be doing or enjoy doing. Nothing brings me pleasure. So each day I wait for it to be bedtime so I can once again slip into unconsciousness for a little while only to be disappointed when I wake that it’s time to do it all again.

Can anyone relate?"
"I still cry over a 16 year old boy's death (murdered by his friends) 9 years ago, even though I never knew him.",5,mke065,1,"I don't know why, but this death always makes me feel immensely sad whenever I think about it. It was in Winter, the 16 year old boy was having some kind of night out with his friends. I'm not sure how long he'd known these friends, but he was seen at at a McDonald's with these friends, and wasn't seen alive again. The boy was reported as missing and a search was underway. Early the next morning, he was found in his car in the middle of nowhere, dead and half-frozen. He'd been choked to death and from what I recall it was quite violent as bruises were repeatedly mentioned.

The suspects were never charged due to insufficient evidence. None of the boy's belongings were taken and no motive was revealed. The case remains officially 'unsolved' to this day and from what I recall only one or two YouTube narrators ever mentioned the case with updates. It's like everyone just..forgot about him. His death didn't even get into the national news and it was only mentioned in a few papers.

I just think, it must've been so scary to be alone at night in the middle of nowhere with a group of three friends who seemed completely normal up until that point with him in the car with them, then they (for no apparent reason) turned on him and killed him. That's like a living nightmare. Then to add insult to injury the suspects were never charged so the kid (and his girlfriend) doesn't even have any closure.

This case kind of makes me want ghosts/spirits to not be real, because if his ghost/spirit is still wandering around, I feel like your murderers getting away with murder would be absolute torture and you still don't know why they just killed you out of the blue in a really painful slow way. If that happened to me I think I'd have a massive mental breakdown in my mind as I died.

I wish there just could have been someone walking by so they could've saved him. Then he'd still be alive.

He'd be 25 years old now. Sometimes I get reminded of his death and I cry. I imagine the terror he went through and the fear, the hopelessness, the terrified look on his face, the feeling of betrayal, how it was all dark/alone in that car, everything. For some reason he tends to come up in my dreams a lot, like I'll dream that it comes up in the newspaper that he made some miraculous recovery in the hospital, and he awoke from a coma and he's still alive. I get excited and happy, then I wake up and realize it's just a dream and he's gone.

If I ever travel to the town/state he died in, I'd make it a point to get some flowers for him and leave them at his grave.

(To the boy) I hope that wherever you are right now, you're safe."

DEPRESSION MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE,1754,mjimbp,150,"One minute you’re fine and the next you feel so down that you can’t even get up or think or do anything and all for NO FUCKING REASON. Like nothings wrong but you just feel so down FOR NO REASON.  It legit makes no sense.

What actually works when life is shit?,3,mkfxki,6,"So, I've been wanting to ask this question for a long time now.  
Do anti-depressants actually work?  
Also, I've heard that sometimes the kicking in (ie, effect) of those medicines takes place at different times for different people.   
Like for eg: 1) Person A noticed the effects within a week 2) Person B noticed the effects within a month.  


Is this true?"
How do you get things done when you’re depressed?,1,mklzzs,2,"Trying to find the motivation to clean my room and bathroom. We have an inspection tomorrow but I don’t feel like getting out of bed or doing anything today.

To do list:
- pour bleach/white vinegar into the toilet bowl and let it sit for 30 minutes
- scrub the toilet bowl
- clean the area behind the toilet
- scrub the bathtub
- scrub the sink
- wipe the windows
- clean the mirrors
- sweep and mop the bathroom floor
- sweep the hallway
- de-clutter and tidy my bedroom
- sweep and mop the bedroom floor
- put new sheets on my bed
- air the place"
Linear thinking,2,mkhqew,1,"Sometimes, I become aware of the linear thinking of my mind. It's the same feeling as having a lucid dream:
I woke up and the first thing coming to my mind was: ""This is it. This is my life from here to 2 years"". I was picturing myself exactly the same as I feel *now*. 

Generally, that is enough to sink my mood, agreeing to that idea, but today it was just silly. 
Of course that awareness didn't make me feel better, but it let me acknowledge it and let the feeling to fill me up and cry.

Like parenting myself. 

It's kinda funny but makes me wonder if that's good or bad thing.
I feel better now, so I choose to think is a good thing. Lame or not, it is what works for me."
Am I wrong for hating my family. They aren't the worst but I just ... can't stand them. Do I even hate them? Or what. What's wrong with me,1,mklwyn,1,"I can't tell if my family is bad. Am I wrong to feel like this?????? Gosh. But I hate this fucking place. I hate that I'm born here. And I hate that I'm me.


My parents aren't the worst but they aren't the best. It's because of them I hate myself though. And they're pretty close minded. I won't go in depth with my dad since he's not around anymore, but I'm pretty sure he's worse than my mum anyway. My mum really thinks just because it's someone is gay less than a normal human. 


I can tell my mum tries her best but I still can't fucking stand her. I wanna cut ties from everything that has to do with now. I need to leave....... I'm only 20. So it's hard. I know in other countries people are independent at 18 but it's different here. Even at 21 a lot of people here are still dependent on their parents.


I feel bad and ungrateful but I can't fucking stand all of this. I hate them. And you know what. They can hate me too. I don't even care if I die so why would I care about anything else"
My life is just a mess and I want to die,5,mkdoaw,2,Me 14m have been struggling with getting diagnosed with autism it's all but  confirmed I show all signs pointing towards it and my government isnt helping (britain) I sliced my hands with glass and sharp plastic and I'm no longer in school due to my problems please can I just have some advice I can't do this anymore
My life is pointless,3,mkemak,3,"I have hit a point where I’m entirely lost. I’m 23 and gone through a lot of crap. I’ve suffered with anxiety, panic attacks and depression since I turned 6 but I’ve never really gotten any real help. The NHS sucks and I was really let down by CAMHS when I was in their care. My therapist was lazy and discharged me with a diagnosis for autism that was later deemed redundant. But ever since, I’ve only ever been unsuccessfully put on adult waiting lists, even though I’ve a mental health history. Bit lost with that all.

Essentially, I have nothing. I’ve no friends, no passions and no career ambitions. My relationship with my parents sucks, and I’m generally just a useless person. I want to go to university and I keep trying to get my Level 3 qualifications, but I always suffer with manic episodes and suicidal tendencies due to the stress which forces me to drop out. Then I’m never able to land job interviews because I am not an attractive candidate (lack of qualifications, hospital school history, diagnoses, etc).

I’m just not sure what this is all for. I feel like I’m mostly an inconvenience to everyone. I suck and no one wants to know me. My only good friend has finally admitted I carry too many red flags for her to be comfortable anymore, and I don’t even know how to stop myself. I don’t want to be like this but nothing seems to fix it.

Genuinely, what am I expected to do? I only ever see one out these days but I don’t want to take it."
Are you meant to feel happy when the depression is over?,1,mklve7,0,"I first realised I was depressed 10 years ago and tbh life wasn't great before then either, but I felt happy for the first time in 5 years about halfway through 2016, probably because I was out of school for the summer and was able to give myself time to mend. But then life started again and I went back to feeling hollow. 

I'm working now and since 2016 I've had a few minor depressive relapses, but apart from that I just have a nagging feeling of hopelessness for the future and I don't know if I'd call it depression or not, but it's not like I'm thinking of ways to kill myself every day or anything.

If you told me I had a terminal illness I think I'd be a bit relieved, but I feel like it's more because the world sucks than because of depression.

Basically what I'm asking is does it sound like I'm still depressed, or am I just jaded and miserable because who the hell wouldn't be in 2021?

I can still have fun with things I used to enjoy doing, like marathoning TV shows and playing video games (I'm actually pretty excited for a few upcoming releases), but every day still feels like a pointless waste of time.

Am I supposed to be happy? Is anyone?"
I want to end the pain and suffering.,1,mklodm,12,"I can’t anymore. This whole world is bad and I can’t live hear anymore. No one cares about me.

I literally quit everything I do but I even start it so what’s the points I ain’t got no future, everyone doing there own thing and I just being a lazy. It’s just me. I don’t wanna live a life with this illness anymore, I don’t wanna live a life where I don’t and can’t let people know my thought and opinion. Last night I was going to take some pills. I didn’t but I might do tonight."

Finally I deleted your pictures and it hurts,3,mkfmq8,0,"I restored our picture in the hard drive but the pictures still in my phone and today I decided that I need to delete it and start healing. I cried out loud as I deleted our pictures from my phone and social media but I knew I needed to heal and let you go. We have so many wonderful memories during the 5 years of our relationship. We lived together for 4 years, we cooked, watched movies, played games, supported your hobbies, encouraged you to fulfill your dreams, cared for you when you was sick, explored the world together \[traveled\], accepted and adored your flaws, when you struggled I will always find a way to ease your struggle.  I feel sad if I'm not being able to help you. I will always have your back no matter what. I said don’t worry, if plan A doesn’t work, there’s always Plan B, it still doesn’t work, we still have C to Z. There’s always a way. We will make it.   


The day you broke up with me because of depression. I'm still there to help you for 2 months, I'm did researched for everything about depression so I can understand better and help whatever I can but you pushed me away, you told me you didn’t need my help. You said we were over, you don’t know if you still love me or not. Get your life and move on.  It hurts and yet I still not given up to help you. I called your mother and told her the situation you were going through. That was the last option I had to help you. When the day you told me, you get help from a therapist. That was the last day I called you. At least I know you gonna be fine.    
If you really don’t love me anymore, you don’t have to worry anymore. I will never come to disturb your life again. Perhaps because of my flaws and imperfections make you unhappy about me. I'm sorry I tried my best to be a good partner and your bestfriend but I still not the one you want.   I wish nothing but the best for you. I hope you will find your happiness that you deserve."
Vivid nightmares,2,mkhb5m,2,"Just wanted to let it out here.
I had series of terrible dreams where I woke up drenched in sweat, I think I woke up 2-3 times and everytime I went back to sleep it’s another blood, rape, murder - and always family related

And I had another ringing in my left ear when I woke up. Already confused and disoriented, I started to panic thinking my tinnitus might coming back.
Thankfully it was gone when I woke up in the morning but still terrifying experience oh god

 I really don’t know why it’s happened because I didn’t watch or read anything horrific. I was slightly sick though(sinus infection with headache)

I wonder it’s deep seated problem or just random fuckups my brain make

And I’m really depressed today because of this, not to say that this CAUSED my depression but rather brought it up again, can’t stop thinking about it nor get this depressing feeling out of my mind

Thanks for reading..."
I'm ruining the relationships with my friends,3,mkfet7,0,I talk a lot about my mental health struggles. Most of the time it's kind of like sad jokes. But some of my friends were feeling really bad because they were dealing with the same things. I had one of my mates dad tell me how it was affecting him. I felt so bad and was seriously hating myself because of it. They've kinda stopped talk with me as much and I can't help but feel completely at fault.
Feeling numb/nothingness,9,mkaqz2,3,"When I used to get depressed I found myself being really emotional and have breakdowns fairly often. Ever since the pandemic started it felt like I started to lose my emotions to the point where I feel numb. There is such a strange feeling in my head like this pressurized cloud preventing me from feeling anything or thinking properly. I used to be able to express myself more back then so coping was not as difficult but now it's like this battle in my head if what I'm feeling is valid. The battle in my head makes me just stay quiet because I feel like my thoughts/ feelings aren't worth talking about. I'm also lost with life and what I want to do, I'm a new uni grad (24 M) and it's difficult to find my place in this world during the pandemic. My parents rely on me a lot so I feel this pressure that I need to have things figured out and contribute to helping my family... especially right now when I'm sure everyone is dealing with financial and mental health issues. But not having things figured out or doing anything due to what's going on in the world really aggravates me. 

I'm not even sure why I'm typing this out and I'm not really looking for answers,  I guess it would just be nice to see if someone feels the same and see if typing it out makes me feel better. 
Thank you for reading."
Does my partner have depression? What more can I do to help him?,2,mkh3rs,0,"My partner (M30) has always been a hard worker (possibly a workaholic) and high achiever but he is shy and sometimes finds it difficult to accept compliments. Despite this he’s always been happy and would be motivated further when he allowed himself to accept praise and feel proud of his achievements. However over the last few  months I’ve seen his mood get really low. He normally always likes to be doing something practical and his mood would always be high when he completed something on a weekend e.g building a shed, trying out a new recipe etc but now he says those things don’t give him joy anymore and he often feels anxious thinking about work.

He says he can get temporary amusement in his free time from playing video games but then he’ll feel guilty for wasting that period of time. He also says his mood improves fora short while when we go out for a walk but as soon as we get home he’ll have work on his mind and gets the blues again. He is especially down on Sundays.

His boss and colleagues all seem to love him and he gets loads of praise for his work. He very recently got a huge pay rise. He was initially happy about it and seemed proud of the praising comments he received but now says he feels like he thinks his boss is just blowing smoke up his ass and he doesn’t deserve it. 
He says he feels like if he did fuck-all all day his boss would probably email him to tell him he’s a fantastic worker and it’s making him feel really low and unmotivated. He says he feels lonely in his work and just feels like he doesn’t want to do anything when he’s meant to be working. He actually did very little work during 1 week and said he didn’t get told off or anything and he feels really down about it.

He says he doesn’t think it’s from working from home / lockdown coz he goes into the office 2 days a week and still feels the same.

I’ve done little things to try and lift his mood e.g surprising him with a subway delivery for lunch; suggesting we take a walks 3 times a day. I wrote a list of things he’s done that I’m so proud of him for - this one he said actually made him feel worse and that if I ever tell him I’m proud of him it makes him feel bad. He started to drink quite a lot after work and this worried me so I encouraged him to wind that down to max of 2 glasses of spirit and to avoid drinking if he’s feeling down. I give time to listen to him speak about his day and anything he’s worried about. We also looked up therapists in the area and he says he is feeling optimistic about his first appointment in 2 weeks time but I still feel like I’m not doing enough.

He says he doesn’t think he has depression as he doesn’t feel suicidal he just feels low and lost motivation but I can’t bear to see him like this.
 What else can I do to get the love of my life back to himself?"
It’s only when I’m alone,3,mkf9jf,0,"But I want nothing more sometimes than to just be alone. 

Today I had a little of that time after some relationship turmoil that was caused by me and some irritability. 

And with that time I decided to journal and I broke down

I realized just how sad I really am all the time 
I just never know it because there’s other people distracting me from myself. 

I can never seem to pinpoint when this sadness started or how long its been lingering 

All I know is when it comes it feels like it’s always been there, lingering beneath everything else. 

All the smiles and happiness and even anger. 
I felt those truly I did. 

But when this feeling comes, it’s deeper than any other feeling I’d felt before. 

Thanks brain and company for helping me for a little while, distracting me, making me feel little bit better or evenfor just masking this deep ache in my chest. 

It hurts so much when I realize it’s never really left
The realization of the shell I’ve become. 
How much I’ve let myself slip away. 

Even when the intensity of the feeling goes away and the smiles return. 

I notice I’m not doing the things I should be doing to make myself better 

I’ve lost all motivation to get better because I’ve done it before
 I’ve gotten better

Or so I thought

Because it ALWAYS comes back And it’s like all the work I did was pointless 
Leaving me to feel like a failure and a fraud. 

I notice it’s much easier for my brain to trick me when others are around, I notice I’m instantly different (happier or just irritable) because I don’t want to explain. 

Part of me feels like sadness is weakness. 

Part of me thinks they won’t understand. 

Part of me thinks I’m overreacting or being overly emotional. 

But damn this shit hurts    

But I’ll be fine 

I’m just tired.

is the bet lost?,0,mkknqi,1,"Hypothetically speaking:

Someone, while outside from his old house, makes a bet and says that he wont return home to get paper napkins. He also points to the direction of the old house while saying it.

1.5 year later, he is outside from his NEW house and he returns home to get water bottles in order to dispose them outside. When he arrives to the house, he notices more trash and decides to clean it. He rushly picks trash items and throws them into the trash bags. The first item that he randomly picked and put into the trash bag, was a napkin but he did not fully realise it. He then continued rushly picking and putting other trash items to the bag. He left his house with the trash bag full of trash and disposed it outside.

1) He did not lose the bet. The bet was that he wont return home to get paper napkins. Which means that there are some specific actions and 1 specific intention that start from outside of his house. He returned for the bottles (different intention). After entering the house, he noticed more trash and decided to pick every trash and put it into the bag (new circumstance). He picked napkins along with other trash and put them into the trash bag. Picking items from his whole house may count as cleaning so its a new event. Napkins were put into the bag with other trash, so they became trash. He left his house with the trash bag. If someone asks him what did he do? He would say that he returned for the bottles BUT decided to clean his whole house (new event) by putting trash into the bag along with the bottles.Bet not lost.

2) He lost the bet. The man returned for the bottles but decided to pick more trash items. Since he was planning to take trash items by putting them into the bag, with the intention to get them out in order to dispose them, he had the chance to pick everything except napkins. By deciding to pick the napkins and put them along with the bottles in which he returned for, maybe it counted as if he returned to get the bottles and also the napkins. Even though they were trash, he had the option which trash to choose to take out. Since he returned for the bottles and then, decided to take napkins, it maybe counted as if he returned to get bottles AND napkins. Bet is lost.

What do you think and why?"
Lonely as all hell,4,mkduls,1,"I wish I had a partner. Like realistically speaking I don’t think I’m ready for it yet. Really I know I’m not. But it still hurts to see practically everyone else around me having somebody or at least enough friends to keep them from struggling so much with the urge. I can’t talk to anybody about my feelings either cause I’ll just get hit with what I ALWAYS do. “You’re too young for a relationship” “Relationships are hard work” “You’re never gonna get married” “You don’t need a boy in your life” “Marriage ain’t all it’s cracked up to be.” Thats just a few things I hear/have heard the instant I do much as mention a boy or dating. Hence why I’ve stopped talking to anybody about it. But still. Suffering in silence is no better. I not only want someone to be intimate with, I want someone to just talk to. Hang out with. Do my favorite things with. Get in petty arguments with just to apologize and forget about it later. 


But no. People try to scare me into staying single by telling me horror stories about their relationships, either past or current. Not to mention my own parents didn’t even stay together and had a horrid relationship that ruined the whole family. So unfortunately I don’t have good role models where it matters most either. And with my mental/emotional problems if makes me think, who’d what to put up with me? What if we end up hating each other after like a month and split up? After all none of my platonic relationships have really gone well either. Why would a romantic one be any different? What if people just guilt me for being with someone instead of staying single? What if my dad doesn’t approve? He’s the kind of person to sense one thing wrong about a guy and send him running, preventing me from having any further contact whatsoever. Which I think is one of the main reasons I can’t talk to guys. I’ve never been allowed to even be friends with one. And as long as I’m living with my dad I don’t be able to. Even though I’m 20. Not to mention the only guys I seem to attract are literal creeps, like old men who are pervs or young guys who just want in my pants. Even then it’s just the never ending doubt. The what if’s, never stop. 

So I guess I’ll either be stuck being alone for good or I’ll end up in a relationship and unhappy. At least that’s what everyone’s convinced me. Stupid as it seems it’s got me crying in the middle of the night. This is why I feel like it’s better to be cold and distant. Emotions are such a waste of time."
I dont even know anymore,5,mkdt0q,2,"I'm 14 and I find myself putting up a humorous and cheerful persona around people I bottle my real emotions up and barely cry apart from when it all comes out on random nights

During it I think of how much I wish to love/be loved but I dont feel I deserve it 
I also think about how much I hate myself more of being overweight as I gained much weight over the past 2 years 
I isolate myself from others around me but I do want to be around people but I just cant find the energy to do anything really 

Theres a bit more but I'm not comfortable talking about it right now"
Strange experience with my friend. Need some opinion or a different perspective ...,3,mkf0gz,9,"Hello to everyone!

First I would like to say that I am very supportive toward people who are going through depression because I know how hard is to get out of this ""state of mind"". I wish all of you the best and the quickest recovery possible - nothing but LOVE. I am 32 years old male and I don't have clinical depression (so I am not gonna talk about how I understand everything), but I experienced some extreme depressive states in the last few months.

This is my first post here because I come to the point where I need some different perspectives/opinions of people who struggled with the same experience.

5 years ago I met my ""at least I thought BFF"". My friend was very depressive (was on some medications), was constantly negative toward the environment, and was always in a cycle of thinking negative things. Explaining all his troubles from the past, present, and fears for the future. Since I am the kind of person who accepts people as who they are, I didn't think of him ""Something is wrong with you"", but I decided to support him. Before I met my ""BFF"", I was a ""normal"" person, who experienced some depressive states, but I was never ""super depressed"". In beginning, we would hang out once per week for 4 - 5 hours + I would call him (2 - 3 hours phone conversation) every single day (and I am not overexaggerating) to check on him if he is doing OK and if he needs someone to talk to. In the beginning, his mental state was not ""affecting me"", since I was reacting positively toward him and I genuinely wanted to help him.

Not that it matters, but I was very successful in the majority of life areas in comparison to my ""BFF"". I have a master's degree in economics, my friend's high school diploma. I started to work when I was 20, my friend finds his first job when he was 30. I have a high-paying job, my friend was getting a ""social security fee every single month"". I hold a high position in my firm, my friend is working in production departments/warehouses. I had a lot of friends, my friend was considered a loner. I had a great relationship with my parents and GF, my friend was resentful with his parents and never had a life partner. I lived in a 60m2 apartment, he lived in an apartment of 10m2 and couldn't normally go to the bathroom. Like I said those things didn't matter to me, and this information will come in handy later in this Post.

Example: When he would say ""I would really like to have a job"" --> I would stay positive and tell him, that he will find the job or to focus on what he would like to do and if he needed help I can give him some pointers on how to write a CV or I can help him to find a job (use some of my connections). He didn't want to work, because was focusing on himself, and I accepted that.

Over time I started to notice that whenever we would hang out or have a phone conversation that he was bringing me ""DOWN"".  I remember one time when I would listen to him saying about past suicidal thoughts for 5 hours, I came home and I wanted to explode from all the negative energy (had a massive headache, couldn't sleep, etc.). Since I was always told by my parents, to be supportive of society and especially friends, I was thinking ""this is what a real friend should do"". I didn't panic too much. In the last 5 years, he made a lot of improvements and I am/was very happy for him. He found a job, he moved away from his parents, he started to see some girls (nothing serious), he found some friends, starting to incorporate some habitual routine toward his life (reading book, going for a walk, studying about programming, etc.). Let's just say that I saw some massive improvements in his life, and I was also proud of myself since I believe I was his ""helping hand - even if just for 1 %"". I was there for him when everyone left him!

Last 3 months I started to experience a depressive state of mind and since I was supportive of my friend for 5 + years, I thought it would be a good idea to share this experience with him since he dealt with depression his whole life and if someone could give me some pointers on how to deal with depression, it might be him. When I told him, that I have a rough period of time, he listened to me. Which felt great! But after I gave him ""insight into my personal struggle"", he started to behave differently.

He would give comments or behave like:

(1) ""I purchased iPhone, because I can and not many people can purchase it, am I right?"" --> Trying to insult me, since I don't have iPhone, which I could purchase in a heartbeat if I would want to.

(2) ""I am making money, and I saved so much money in the last 6 months, I know how hard is for you?"" --> Trying to insult me, like I can't barely buy myself something to eat. Which doesn't make sense, since I make 3 x more than him and I save money as well.

(3) He stopped calling me, and when I reach out to him, he would be rude and behave like I am a ""piece of s\*\*\*"".

(4) One day when we would hang out, he would say to me, that we need to stop or reduce our hanging time, without giving me a more specific reason. He would say something like ""You need to pick yourself up, and then we can start hanging out"" or ""I used to think of you as a Role Model, but now not anymore"".

All I want to say is this ""I was always supportive to my friend for 5 years, and I would listen to his trouble every single day and getting this negativity from him"", which to be honest had some affection toward myself and how my mental health developed. Now when I have some problems, he is nowhere around. He doesn't care for me, as much as I cared for him. It hurts! The most absurd thing is that ""He started to behave toward me like I am a loser, and he is like a person who has everything under control.

Now I understand ""Why people avoid depressive people"". Does anyone had the same experience, where (1) you accept the negative/depressive person in your life and that person affected your life in a negative way, and when you develop some mental health issue (not sure, but most likely from my BFF), they see you as a loser and they want to move on with their life?"
*ADHD issues & Major Depression MEDICATION Q*,1,mkkh5u,2,"I’ve been unofficially diagnosed with ADHD as a 24(F). I say unofficial because I can’t currently afford the 1,000 test to make it official but my therapist (who specializes in ADHD) and I both agree. I also have major depressive disorder but my therapist can’t tell which is worse as they are both so intertwined. I started Wellbutrin and had a rare side effect of myalgia and muscle/bone pain after only 3 days of medication so I was forced to stop. My doctor is giving me a week to settle before prescribing the next attempt and is allowing me to look into what I think is best and he will prescribe whatever it is. He thinks we should focus on the depressive symptoms first and see if that helps before moving into any stimulants (as he fears they may increase anxiety symptoms and i guess because my diagnosis is ‘unofficial’. Basically i’m asking if anyone has experienced anything similar and has any recommendations of medication that worked for them? I was bummed about Wellbutrin because I really thought it would be the miracle drug for me. :/"
Coping Methods,3,mkdpzr,4,Diagnosed with bipolar 2 Currently going through a depression episode right now seeing a therapist in a month. Off medication at the moment I’m not a huge fan of pills. Just want to know what Healthy coping methods you guys use that help out when feeling hopeless. Sorry my mind is really foggy right now and can’t think straight.
It feels like my past has caused near irreparable damage,2,mkgmjs,0,"This is a hefty vent, and no one has to read it, but I need to get it out.

I (20F) was born into a dysfunctional family, by no fault of its members. My mom had crippling Anxiety and my dad Depression. I just so happen to have inherited both. Go me...

My brother has a form of autism that has diminished over the years. He's one of the most wonderful guys you'll ever meet, but when I was little he was abusive, and so was my dad. What happened wasn't their fault; it never, ever will be. It still hurt though. My brother would hit me over the head as hard as he could multiple times a day, and yell in my ears; they would just laugh as I cried. My dad's not a bad person, he just didn't have any other way to connect with his son, who only payed attention to my mum. I stress ate to cope with how hectic my home life was, so I got fat. This was the base of all the teasing directed at me by almost everyone I knew. My mom was never around to see it. She couldn't cope with the chaos, so she just wouldn't come home. I don't blame her.

My other memories consist of jumping from babysitter to babysitter, never feeling present, never getting attention. No one had time for me because my brother needed them more. Again, I don't blame them, but as a kid I believed no one wanted me. I hung out with bad crowds of ""friends"", always a weak link; the little fat girl that did what they wanted because she was desperate for a friend. I sat alone at recess, drawing. I felt like a corpse. Kids can be so cruel. My teachers and peers thought I was odd, and on every report card, I got bad grades. There was a note on every one saying: ""She needs to focus when the teacher is speaking."" I couldn't, being in my reality was too stressful. I never really grew out of that need to distract myself.

Then, when I was around 11, my mom had an affair. She met a guy on a website for smokers, and fell in love with him. She travelled to America a lot during that time. My dad knew, and he had nobody else but me to talk to about it. I remember the three of us: My dad, my brother and I just crying on the floor as my dad talked about what was happening. He asked me often if I thought what my mom was doing was fair. I tried to support him, but I never knew what to say. He always seemed a hair's width away from ending it all. This went on for two years, and then summer came. My mom was in America with this guy. She was planning on leaving him because he had tried meth and other hard drugs and she was in danger. Then he killed himself and she found him on the floor. I can't imagine what that must have done to her. She was in denial for months. I was a 13 or 14 year old when she came home from that trip. I tried to help her at the expense of my own wellbeing. I was there for her as a shoulder to cry on when she felt hopeless. I don't regret it, but I couldn't process it at the time.

We're a close family now, full of love, but damaged. My mom always asks me how I could be so sad and hate myself so much when I'm so loved. Sometimes I wonder if she knows the impact of all the shit that went down as I grew up. I didn't really have a great childhood. I'll never forget what my high-school counsellor told me when I opened up about my life this one time: ""How did you make it this far?"" It felt validating I guess. I didn't have an answer, still don't. Now I'm expected to be a functioning adult as if nothing ever happened. No one ever taught me how to do that.

I was kind of healing, and then 'rona hit and that all went to shit. I'm in University studying music, and I'm almost done, but the mental toll is killing me and I want to kill myself. I'm wildly depressed, but I feel like I should have my shit together. God I want to die, and it's my fault.

To anyone who read this near-novel sized post, thanks. It's nice knowing someone lent an ear (or, I guess a pair of eyes.)"
Bad experience with edibles?,1,mkkbyk,2,"So this was last night... I took a shot of alcohol at like 7pm, I'm not light weight or anything but I decided to only do one, and I took the edible around 1130. It didn't really hit until like 1230 to 1. My friend said it was 10mg and I've never smoked before and it was my first time trying edibles too. The feeling kind if sucked? It was like I was too tired to focus on how I felt but I got shakes?? Every 5 to 10 seconds felt like I was in a dream and I was aware of it but in the dream I was falling and if you know the jolt your body gets right before you hit the ground and you wake up THAT'S what it felt like.. that constant jolt. Anyway I slept at 330 and woke up at 7 and my stomach feels awful. Idk if it's the mix with the shot and the weed? Or if maybe it's just the edible? Just wondering if a stomach ache or shakes are normal for a first timer lol"
I feel like family and friends don't care,12,mk7pzm,2,"I've been depressed for 9 years now and during that time I opened to my mom and friends a couple of times, but it seems they just forget about it or don't care, because I try to act normal, or because I laugh. Ofc we have happy moments when depressed, but laughing doesn't mean I'm cured. I can't remember a week in these past 9 years that I didn't want to kill myself. I kinda wish we would become ghosts when we die just to see their reactions to your suicide"
I am losing my mind.,3,mket7a,1,"My loneliness is slowly killing me and will eventually kill me. Nobody talks to me. Nobody recognizes my existence. I tried everything to make friends. I have tried everything to find a partner. I have tried everything for 21 years of my life and nobody wants me. I am a 42 year old man and I cannot take it. I have been crying for the past couple of days, my chest hurts and I have moments where it is even difficult to breath. I am not okay. Nobody helps me or even tries to help me. I am losing my mind and I am not coping."
Why does he have this power,3,mkdjc3,4,"A little while ago, I finally cut off a toxic, narcissistic, asshole of a ""friend"". I was in a depressive state for weeks after that and now I finally get better, he finds a way to talk to me. He didn't say anything, didn't do anything, he just said hello to me. And now I'm back in a depressive mood and I'm having one of my anxiety related tics, and its awful. He has this power, and it pisses me the hell off."
Im just fucking tired,19,mk53rb,5,"I hate not being in control of my life, physically and emotionally. I hate being incompetent and I hate being at the mercy of my emotions.

Mourning over a lost weekend,4,mkdfwt,0,"Ok, the title is a bit dramatic.... but this Easter weekend I pushed myself to make plans. I had almost a full weekend planned, a nice hike, a movie and some ice skating.... but my housemate didn't send through rent on time and it came out of my account and it got overdrawn. I literally lost all the money I had for the weekend! So all those plans were cancelled and I've been sitting at home all weekend like a usless blob. I really hate how things like this happen and it just sends me into a depressive spiral, I was feeling ok, I just hate how emotionally fickle I am, one small inconvenience and I'mnot getting out of bed. I've forced myself to go out a couple of times and just walk around my neighbourhood, but it doesn't feel the same.
Anyway, I really hope everyone else had a better weekend than I did!"
I think I'm just gonna live up to a certain age like 40 and then off myself,9,mk93a6,4,"I know I'm young and everything with just 19 years but I honestly don't see how things are supposed to magically solve themselves for me. I've never been one to work hard ever in my life and all previous attempts and improving my wellbeing have failed. They say some people just can't be helped. I'm probably one of those people, destined to live and die a shitty life."
Starting to realize that I'm not okay.,2,mkgcgn,0,"This is just going to be me complaining, but literally nobody in the world will listen to me so here we are.

I'm unhappy and hopeless. I'm taking an overloaded courseload, so my life is consumed in going from assignment to assignment trying to get everything in on time but I still don't feel like I really understand the things I need to to go into my career. I need an internship to graduate but I have no idea how to even go about doing that, or what they would expect of me, or how I would even be able to satisfy them. I'm totally unmotivated, just dropped a class last week. My main laptop is totally dead, the battery in my car is dead, I constantly feel dead, I don't know whether I'm dreading the future or desperate to escape the present. Probably both. 

I'm totally alone in the world: 0 friends and emotionally distant family. Town is in lockdown hell so even uni clubs are basically stopped and nothing is happening. I haven't had a conversation in months, probably. This room feels like solitary confinement, and my laziness only increases with how indifferent I am to my success and how there's nobody in the world who cares one way or the other if I succeed anyway. 

On another account, some user said something nice and hopeful to me unprompted and I started crying. My sleep schedule is fucked. My eating habits are fucked. My mental health is fucked. I don't have hobbies anymore except sleep. I often hope that I'll be caught in a gas explosion or something so that I can have a painless, guiltless exit from the world. 

And it's only very recently occurred to me that maybe I'm really not okay. I'm not starving, I've got an above-average amount of savings because I've worked for a long time and I never spend any money. But it all just feels totally empty and I only keep going out of a vague sense of obligation. Feels that if I lose my momentum then it'll be gone permanently and I'll burn out into a soulless shell of a person with no accomplishments and no means, living an uncomfortable and hard life. 

Well there's my rant, a tale told by an idiot, deflated and pitying, signifying nothing. How's your day?"
How depression really feel like,16,mk5xjd,4,"The voice inside my head is screaming but no word cross my mouth. Feels like a deep black hole inside of me which eats all of my emotions. My body is functioning but I don’t feel like I’m breathing. Just existing in this world full of money, superficial people and sex. Everyone wants love but nobody is willing to give love. Nobody see the pain inside my eyes but I can see the pain in everyone. My eyes scream for help but no one can hear me. Why I am the only one who feel this way? Am I an alien? Standing up in the morning only to go to the bed at night, not crying anymore because every inch of myself is numb, drowning in the hole inside of me. You can’t tell anyone because everytime you talk people hear you but they don’t listen. They don’t understand what I’m saying. In the end we will not remember how much we had, money or a nice car, we remember the people we loved and cared about, but they are so rarely. We all want a long hug from someone we love, but nobody is willing to give it, even it would be so simple and helping. 
We are lost in the universe, just floating."
THIS. It never really goes away... I'm beyond exhausted and lonely. The people around me can't understand how much I struggle and I don't blame them. And I hate myself for being so powerless and helpless to just end things.,1,mkjp8b,0,"""Then there is this: In some way, the quiet terror of severe depression never entirely passes once you’ve experienced it. It hovers behind the scenes, placated temporarily by medication and renewed energy, waiting to slither back in, unnoticed by others. It sits in the space behind your eyes, making its presence felt even in those moments when other, lighter matters are at the forefront of your mind. It tugs at you, keeping you from ever being fully at ease. Worst of all, it honors no season and respects no calendar; it arrives precisely when it feels like it."" - Daphne Merkin, A Journey Through Darkness"
Perpetually lost,3,mkegfo,2,"I sit here tonight, staring at this post in progress, thinking ""what do I say? How do I say it?"" Truly opening up is hard. It means I have to stop hiding my secrets, drag then out, and risk it all again. I'm sure there's tons of people who can empathize with me. I'm not alone. But logic and feeling don't always agree. Is this even the place to just lay it all out? 45 minutes a week in therapy feels so superficial, so short. It's never enough, but what do I tell her? I can't even look at her.

I'm nothing important. Nothing special. And honestly, I'm not even a good person. And somehow, I still need that validation, that... Whatever it is I need but can't ever find. I'm just... Heck, I don't know."

No I'm not depressed because of the pandemic.,278,mjqgbm,55,"I've been depressed way before that. I hear many students complaining they're depressed, wishing things would go back to normal. Pathetic me wants things to stay the same. I want everyone to be miserable. Besides, I've been miserable even before, and I doubt anyone would give a shit even when things go back to normal. 

I honestly don't care. I am used to being alone. Surviving in my own thoughts with no one to talk to. I'm not fucking sad because I don't have any friends. I've fucking dealt with it because I have to, because no one will help me. So if you can't fucking party with your friends for a year, boo fucking hoo.

I know I sound like a terrible person, but I used to be caring. I've stopped giving a shit though, it saves the trouble."

other depressed people seem to still have lives - i don’t,2,mkfqtt,2,"sometimes i see other depressed people still have some semblance of a life, and it makes me feel useless. seeing even the low functioning ones function better than i do reminds me that i’m at rock bottom, and that their bare minimum is literally me at my maximum power :(

i promise i’m not saying my depression is more valid than anyone else’s because of this! actually the opposite! i’m saying it makes me feel even more hopeless about my situation, knowing i’m as low as i am. it makes me feel like a failure of a human being.

i won’t describe my lifestyle in full detail because it’s too humiliating. but i don’t go to school, i don’t work, i never leave the house (regardless of quarantine), and i don’t have friends. not a “i have friends but just don’t feel understood by them” scenario either. i haven’t socialized or bonded with someone my age in years. no one except family texts or checks in on me. i don’t go out to have fun, even for myself.

just imagine the least stimulating life you can imagine, and i’m 21 years old living it. it would be no less different if i were brain dead honestly

I think failed my checkpoint,3,mkdswg,1,Hello. I’m 11 years old and today I just took my checkpoint exam. It was English. It was also really hard. There was this section where you had to write an essay but i was panicking since there wasn’t enough time for me to complete it. The essay was to write about an newspaper article but I wrote a completely different theme. What should I do? I’m gonna fail my checkpoint exam. Any suggestions on how to boost my confidence up?
I really don't like the twenty first century; constantly living in a state of nostalgia,4,mkb7ol,4,"While my childhood and teenage years weren't great, in which I was  bullied by my peers, I still relatively had a good childhood. When I wasn't having to deal with schoolyard torments, I escaped to a world of nerd culture, and had hopes and dreams for my life as an adult in which things would be better.

In the past decade or so I've been finding myself reflecting on my childhood growing up in the 1980's quite often, and daydream about how great life was for me, especially waking up on Saturday mornings to watch cartoons, eat cereal and play with my action figures, summer vacations and just having no adult responsibilities.

About a month ago I came across a box filled with videotapes, and started going through them. They were filled with television shows I had recorded throughout the 1990's, the height of my teenage years. Watching those videos has made me feel both nostalgic and extremely depressed in the past few weeks. They're from a time when I had so much hope and optimism, when I thought I would make something of myself as an adult. I also see things like the commercials of that era, or even late night talk shows, and it made me realize how much I dislike our current culture in comparison to the one I grew up with. I'm now constantly living in a state of ""I wish we could go back to that way of life"", and I find myself scrambling trying to find more programming of that era, or tuning into music from that time period. Then I hear a song from 1996, something I probably haven't heard since then, and I feel sick to my stomach like I want to throw up. I like the song, but it makes me incredibly sad for the fact I never got to experience life like most other teenagers did, and things didn't get better as I got older.

I've got a whole set of problems as it is (my post history will show that), but in the last few weeks I feel so incredibly lost and longing for a time that I know I can never get back. I think I'm having a mid-life crisis of some kind, but I don't know what to do about it. All I want to do is sleep and keep watching, listening and reading content from my childhood and teenage years, and wishing I could go back. This is not healthy, and I think I need some kind of help.

EDIT I've also been drinking alcohol a lot more lately."
Just learned my job may be at risk and I'm depressed again,3,mkdpii,0,"Today my manager told me the GM feels I may not be doing enough at work and wanted me to list my task and responsibilities. I also learned the GM doesn't know I work 5 days a week instead of 6. I assumed I could work 5 days because I'm on-call.

I feel extremely upset about learning this because I do a lot of work that no one else could but to them it doesn't seem to be enough. I already feel stressed out everyday and I'm afraid if they take my two day away I'm going to breakdown.

My depression has already kicked in and I'm assuming the worst of what's going to happen. If it comes to that I have to do 6 days, I plan to tell the GM that I won't be on-call and I'm going to put my phone on DnD everyday after work.

Sorry for the rant. I wasn't really looking for an answer, but I just wanted to let my feelings out because I have no one in real life who would listen. It would be nice if anyone has a story about a situation at work that worked out on your favor."
working + school while depressed and anxious 24/7,4,mkcaby,1,honestly nothing adds on to my anxiety and depression more than knowing i have to go to work and put forth effort and then focus on school after work. i hate school so much but i can't move forward in life without school. but i also hate working. but i also need money. ugh
Switch off,3,mkdm7v,0,I wish I could just turn off my brain. Everything feels so loud. I always have something negative to say about myself... it sucks
I don't like being alone,2,mkfae9,1,"I'm  a intorvert so I do like being alone but when I'm have one my anxiety attacks or depressive episode, I don't like being alone. Despite that I told my friends and family that I don't like being alone, everyone ignores me and leaves anyways, I even told my roomate who share that same symptoms as me and even he takes off for 9 days without telling me and I'm just constantly sad about this. My fridge is empty and my house is messy because I'm just too depressed all the time to do anything and no one seems to understand that, they just yell or harass me and just call me a lazy person. I'm sorry for rambling on, I just want so eone to hear ,e out"
I just don’t get it,2,mkfa5l,0,"I feel like shit all the time and am in constant search for quick temporary remedies to feel something. But what is it even all for? Everything is tiring. I don’t even know if I’m even suffering that much, I just want out"
in the middle of work and i really feel like breaking down,5,mkay5h,3,all i want is to kill myself and disappear from this world without feeling guilty about leaving broken-hearted people behind.
How to be vulnerable with your loved ones about your depression?,2,mkf6rz,1,"I’m (19f) currently really struggling with my depression and I’m feeling the need to tell my family, but it feels so weird and uncomfortable to be vulnerable with them. Growing up they were kind of emotionally distant which is why it took me so long to tell them I was depressed in the first place. 

When I did first tell them about my depression, they didn’t really believe me until they saw me have a breakdown. It’s been a few months since and they’ve done a complete 180, almost being helicopter parents now. Calling me, facetiming me and checking in with me like they never have before. 

I want to tell them how I feel since it’s clear they care, but I just don’t know how to be vulnerable with them when I never have before. When they ask, I just tell them everything is fine and going well because I don’t want to scare them or make them feel they failed as parents. I’d really appreciate any advice❤️"
Im trying,2,mkf17x,0,"I know some of y'all have seen my posts about the pills and wanted to die already, two weeks ago I was in a car accident and since that day it opened up my eyes to see how precious life is. Physically I am getting better everyday but mentally....... I don't think that is going to go way anytime soon. I just keep replaying that night, the impact of getting hit, the smell coming from the cars and I am trying my best to get through it but it is hard. Since that night I haven't abused my pills like I was doing every single day, I am not abusing my syrup like I was, I am really trying my best to get off of all that. But the past 2 weeks have been so hard physically and mentally that I just wanna down 10 percs like I was doing before all this happened. I am trying to become a better person but man is it hard.... The hardest thing has been my ""friends"" before I got into the accident I was doing everything for them, if they needed a ride I would take them and never once asked for gas money, I would take us out to eat, drink, everything and if I had money I wouldn't let them pay. I am a nice person with a good heart and pure intentions but it just got me thinking and really depressed like now that I am without a car, hurt, no one has checked to see if I needed anything and I just keep telling myself why is it like that. But maybe the accident happened to open my eyes to alot of things. So anyone thats out there feeling down right now, don't give up! You are loved and if no one has told you this, I am proud of you and you are doing enough. I love everyone who comes across this post and hopefully soon I can get my mental health better 🙁"
when did it all even start?,2,mki2y5,2,"I'm 13, I know I'm young. Actually I don't even know when did this all start and how it is happening to me! So basically when I was 6, my mom went abroad to work and I was left with my dad and my grandma. At that time I don't really care about the things around me but when my dad found a job then lost his time with me, I start to feel the lack of attention? I don't, I can't explain it! And for like 4 years I have minimal connection with my mom and even my dad who live in the same house as me don't have time to spend bonding time. I'm just lucky I have my grandma but 'cuz she's getting old, she started to hallucinate, talk in her sleep, speak absolute nonsense, mood swings and even talking to no one (I don't know actually know if it's 'cuz she's getting old or she have mental disorder, we tried to consult to doctors but she hated the thought of a hospital). All I know my grandma is the only person I can lean on. Then 2 more years later, (I'm at first year of high school) like 6 days after my 12th birthday my grandma passed away, the doctors said that the vein in her nape exploded and that she was already brain dead. When she passed away I don't how to react, it took me like 4 months of moving on and emotional supports from my friends. I thought it'll end there but it didn't. Around May 2020 during quarantine, I found out my dad have another woman, I was shocked and I cried once then I'm numb. I don't even know why I didn't told it to my mom, maybe it's my selfless instinct saying ""It's not your business, don't fuck with it! They're all grown they can handle it!"" And it did not end there, July 2020 still in quarantine, my uncle from my mother side invited me to have sex and being me a person who doesn't like the idea said no! Then he like forced me thankfully he's a small person and I'm not successfully ran away from him and shut myself in my room. And that was the very first time I experienced an anxiety attack and I tell you, it's fucking horrible! The same  incident happen again but I got lucky that one of my friend called me so I was able to escape the hell out of there. I know I should've reported it to my parents or to someone but I was so scared that I didn't have the guts to even utter a word. Just thank god he's gone now, and I just wish he'll never go back here and that his entire soul burn to death. I'm still trying to overcome my panic attacks and my depression? I don't know if I'm just stressed or depressed but I'm highly positive to have either both."
I don't care anymore about shit,3,mkd72v,4,"So, I am a high school student(13). I have never had a friend in my entire life. I saw my mom getting beaten almost everyday by dad. My sis tried defusing the situation but now, she is just the spectator. My dad cheated on my mom. My relatives' children were just spoilt so now they want to leech off of me and get profit. My mom just beat me every other day, my sis just watched. I got bullied by classmates in break. The teacher just watched while I got beaten by them. My mother told me to get good grades, so I did score the best grades in my entire school, but I was still getting bullied. I thought piano would help but it didn't. I did learn a lot of hard pieces of the piano but it never sufficed. I learnt japanese just to forget about it. Eventually it just came back. Counsellors, netizens and everyone just told me that life gets better. It didn't. I am just the same, getting bullied everyday, get beaten at home, emotionally absent. My sis is trying to cut ties with our family. Grades didn't help me. Musical instruments didn't. A language didn't. Counsellors didn't. I guess I just don't care about anything now."
My dog died,4,mkbkc2,4,"My dog died yesteday, and the only thing I can think of is how I will interact with people when I tell them that my dog just died.  
I don't feel anything and it scares me. My dog was my best friend for 11 years straight, he was the most kind dog I know and helped me to get through some tough times. But now he's gone, just like that. He got some kind of infection and in span of 2 days diseased, unable to walk, eat and even drink.  
I cried once when my parents took him in a big black bag (he was big lab so they couldn't get him up any other way) to the vet. I wasn't there for him, I didn't even ask where the vet was. I just felt numb and took a stroll.  
Now I'm sitting in my room and I just don't know. It feels like nothing happened and even wording it like that doesn't make me feel anything. I just thinking of all scenarious about how my friends will react and what I need to say, what face to make. Is there something wrong with me?  
And to think about all of this, is there anything or anyone that I'm afraid of losing? I just feel like an empty vessel, someone out of this world, not in a bad way nor in good.  
Feels shitty but not really  
I'm sorry, Archibald, you are the goodest boy, thank you for everything."
Pushed away my last friend,3,mkd0me,7,"Random impulse told me to, so I did. I thought I might feel something, but I was wrong. She's a cool person but Im an asshole who always plays the victim when I do dumb shit, and Im doing just that by making this post, but who gives a fuck. I may not be *the* victim, but I am a victim. I don't think when I speak, and I'm unwilling to change for the better. I deny help when it's offered, and I hurt all the people around me. I'm broken and flawed and would be better off alone anyway. She's going to get better now that I'm not dragging her down, and I'll probably put myself over the edge and finally let go"
A problem with my mum,1,mkhpjn,0,"Recently I don't really get along with my mum, no like I have ever got along with her, but lately its even worse. She's ignoring me, doesn't speak for all day. I think that she may be depressed, when she went on graveyard, she told me that she's going where she's belongs. I have no idea what I should do, I want make her smile, but I don't know how. I'm really sad and her bad mood affect to me too."
I feel alone even with a loving family,3,mkbc5t,11,"My parents while not perfect are great but nobody ever comes to check up on me even just to shoot a quick “hey” or “what’s up”, my favorite person in the world to talk to has started leaving me on read and now other people are on delivered or read, I’m the butt of every joke my best friends while great people to hang out with  have kind of resorted to making me the butt of the joke sometimes I don’t have a pet because I’m allergic to dogs and cats so no little pet to have as a friend nobody to go to when I’m feeling down cause I don’t want to worry anyone and I’m too scared to commit suicide because I don’t want to hurt the good people in my life"
I hate being unattractive as a female.,15,mk3j0u,11,"being an ugly female is so draining. It’s depressing. I probably wouldn’t be depressed if I weren’t so ugly. I’m constantly reminded of my ugliness every time I look in the mirror to put on makeup to appear a slightly less ugly.. I just wanna die. If anyone feels the same, lmk. Maybe we can be friends lol"
Opinion,3,mkb9gx,1,"I don’t feel like people who haven’t experienced depression are good at helping others with depression, tbh I feel like they only make it worse... idk not trying to start an argument but yeah..."
"Everyday - for years now, I just hide in bed...",23,mk0929,5,"Especially when there are important things I should be doing.  My bed is safe, quite, and comfortable.  It is away from the world and society that has hurt me too often.  Most importantly, I have my dog here with me.  She is sweet, kind, and my only real friend.

The only problem is I am an adult and I am stuck here now.  I don't ever want to do anything.  I know I can work towards making my life better than what it is, or has become, but I just can't bring myself to leave the safety of this bed."
When I was a kid,3,mkcnhc,3,"I had always wanted to have friends, but I never could really make them. I was the girl that was weird and had interests the other kids didn’t have, so I became the outcast as a result. I remember finally gaining the courage to join a club. I ended up being a part of this reading team. Essentially we’d read as many books off e reading list as possible, and then we’d attend competitions at other schools where we answered questions about the books and earned points depending on the difficulty of the question and whether we got it right. This was the closest I had ever gotten to making “friends” at that age, and when the year ended and I learned there was no reading team in high school I cried like a baby while my mother held me. It was pathetic, I knew this, especially since some of the people on the team still made fun of me and were only nice to me because they knew I read the most books out of all of them. I guess it was just the feeling of being needed for once that made me feel good about myself. I had a similar experience when I joined yearbook and discovered I was actually a pretty good photographer. However, that ended in a similar way.

As a young adult though I have plenty of friends. People who truly care about me, and would never intentionally hurt me. Friends who appreciate me for who I am, but when I get super depressed like I am now I kind of close myself off. I have this thought that there is no way someone can love me when I’m in this state. In the state of crying into my pillow and envisioning how much easier it all would be if I just gave up entirely. I think I keep waiting for the day I’m magically better, but as time goes on I realize that there is no such thing as getting better. I will always have generalized anxiety disorder and persistent depression disorder. I will always have these episodes where it feels like I’m drowning in a sea of pure darkness, and sometimes I debate if it’s truly worth it. I wonder if I’m actually being a good friend to my friends, or if they’d be better off without me in their life being inconsistent. The thing is nobody has ever told me that I’m not worth it and that I’m a burden. Well, at least nobody who is currently friends with me. I mean there are plenty of people who have told me some pretty terrible things, and who have dubbed me a shit person who doesn’t deserve the air they breathe. It took years of counseling to come to the realization that sometimes people are just mean and what they say isn’t necessarily the truth. When my mom died I lost a lot of friends. People I was sure cared about me and who I cared about in return. People I would have answered the phone for in a heartbeat and people who had fond memories with. You see, I don’t think anyone can really tell who is their friend and who isn’t until that friendship is put to the test. For me, that was when my mom died. The people who are still here today are those that truly care about me, and the people who left are those who were simply using my friendship for their own selfish gain. It took me a long time to realize this and stop beating myself up. It took sitting down with my counselor and listing every shitty thing that they had done to me to realize that they were never really my friends to begin with.

But then I get into these head spaces. The negative head spaces where it feels like someone is sitting on my chest while I cry, and I realize that maybe they were right. Maybe I am just this shitty person who lies all the time and has never been a good friend to anyone. The lord knows I have never been honest to people about how I truly feel unless they’re my counselor. I have never told people how sometimes the emotional pain of existing and things not going the right way makes me want to take a knife and plunge it into my jugular. That I think about how much of a burden I am and how everyone would be happier if I just following my thoughts to the edge of that bridge and flung myself off. So I close myself off from them, and I don’t answer their texts and when they ask to play games I feign business as a reason why I can’t. I know it’s selfish but I don’t have the energy to entertain them like I usually do when I’m in these states. Can you imagine it? Wanting friends so badly for years, and now I finally have them but I’m too sad to even answer a text message? 

Don’t worry. I’m not actually going to do these things. I have learned to cope through these emotions and hang on long enough until they pass, but that doesn’t make any of this any less difficult and I would be lying if I said that these constant episodes simply exhaust me at this point. God why can’t I just be happy?"
Just now realizing how I was sexually assaulted and forced into a relationship for 2 years,4,mkb4x0,2,"College age male here. I have finally cut a certain toxic person out of my life, and finally the weight of fear and terror I got at every call and every conversation is gone, but now that I've had months to myself I have been able to realize what happened for real.

It started as cuddling, innocent enough, and frankly the sexual contact that started ensuing was definitely wanted by me. At the time it was a FWB relationship -- no romance. However, my first kiss with her, which happened not long into it, was not wanted by me. I did it to satisfy her, and I still remember how catatonic I was during that first kiss -- she even said how awful it was, because I went into complete panic mode, couldn't move at all. First time having real sex was the same -- I didn't really want it yet, I'd expressed that her, but she guilted me into trying 3 times to have sex. I say trying because the first 2 times, my dick wouldn't even get hard due to the anxiety. I wasn't ready for that, it was my first experience of any kind, and it was progressing too fast. Didn't even like her like that.

Feels like none of this even is valid since I willingly made out with her and had sex with her after that though, like, I shouldn't be complaining about it.

I didn't even really want to be in a relationship with her but both my and her mental illness didn't help here. I needed validation and was getting it. The abusive nature of the relationship turned emotional after that. Don't need to get into the yelling, the gaslighting, the everything. It never felt right because I would go to bed feeling even worse every single day but I craved the affection and companionship so much that I stayed. But god, I'm a wreck now, even more than I was before all of this. First really bad depressive episode in a long time today, when I thought I'd gotten better. Gained over 20 pounds in the last couple months. I'm unconvinced anyone desires or wants me, physically or otherwise. I'll never be able to find a relationship worth getting into for me even though I want one. I've been permanently ruined and handcuffed to someone who stunted my growth emotionally during formative years of young adulthood. I just want to break down and cry."
"""We're here if you need us.""",6,mk7zof,1,"So that was a fucking lie, huh?  


I dunno. I'm an awful person aren't I? Maybe it's true, then, maybe I'm just a manipulative piece of shit out to feel sorry for himself like he said. I hate living life as it is and I hate the people who surround me. I've known certain people for years and thought we could call each other pals, only to be thrown out the window some night and called manipulative trash, and then excluded.  


Fuck my life. ""We're here if you need us,"" that's just conditional folks.  


People really don't care unless they get something out of it."
"I'm so tired of having to freak out before I get attention, then people make all these promises so I don't get that low and then they can't hold to them",7,mk7511,6,And I can't keep reminding them because it makes me feel like I'm fucking bothering them no matter how many times they say I'm not
I’m pretty much done with this life,2,mkeep5,1,"Every story has to come to an end. This life just really isn’t worth living anymore and I’d rather finish it off sooner than later. Hopefully it’s just lights out and that’s it. The peacefulness of nothing. Complete isolation, complete darkness.

How would it be any different?"
im just gonna kill myself then,2,mkedty,5,i fucking hate humanity so much
Feeling down,2,mkebxo,1,Idk i feel so empty and unappreciated inside.
Married to depression,6,mk8n91,3,"First off I love my wife. She has battled depression her whole life. We’ve been married almost 9 years. However, her mental illness is beginning to negatively affect me. I don’t know how much longer I can hang on. I don’t know how to talk to her about it because that would just make her even more depressed knowing that her depression is taking a toll on me. How have those in my position dealt with with this? What is the way forward from here?"
Therapy didn’t work either,2,mke9wz,1,"I’m 21f and a grad student. I recently moved across the U.S. and I’ve been having a rough time transitioning. I had a pretty terrible end of year in the last few months of 2020 and that triggered my anxiety and depression. I’ve also been having su*Vidal thoughts pretty frequently. I decided to start therapy a little over a month ago and it didn’t work out the way that I had hoped it would. My therapist wouldn’t react much whenever I spoke about some of the darker things I’d gone through. She never asked how I was doing in the beginning of our sessions before jumping in to talking about my past trauma. She would often show up to our sessions late and I would have to email her to ask if she could hop online. I just felt like she didn’t really care about me or my problems. After our sessions, I never felt like I covered any bases with some of her probing questions. More recently, I terminated our sessions and she asked why. I didn’t have the heart to tell her that we weren’t compatible, so I told her that I would be pursuing different goals. I understand that therapists are also human and make mistakes, but I felt so isolated in my relationship with this particular therapist. I feel really bad about terminating because I want to get help, but I also don’t want to invest so much time into therapy that doesn’t work for me. I submitted paperwork for counseling services this past week and hopefully, I can find someone more suitable for my needs. I feel so hopeless and lost after quitting therapy because I’m starting to wonder if I’m the problem here. Don’t know where to go from here."
What do I do?,1,mkh9j0,1,"My life fell apart after I graduated high school and my parents divorced. Was psychologically addicted to opiates I used to deal with extreme depression and powerful mood swings to the point where I considered suicide but was to afraid to go ahead and do it.

I don't have a job or license because of my own weakness and even dating is out of the question, I can barely function by myself and many people outside of my friends and family would look down on me for being 25 and in the sorry state I am in. I do not want pity, I do not want anything handed to me other than advice. I am a mentally ill borderline autist who suffers from debilitating depression (when I am cold turkey or only on pharmacy antidepressants) and very bad ocd that makes it hard to relax by my self. I have no motivation and pathetic physical stamina (I can barely do anything without getting winded) and I am terrified of the day when both my mother and father both pass away because I can not even fathom of having to live without the two closest people I have ever had that love me unconditionally no matter what.

If there is one thing I have ever been blessed with and lucky to have its 2 parents who adamantly refuse to stop loving or caring about me. I have ambitions of becoming a youtuber for money as well as going into anthropology and similar sciences and perhaps become a polymath of sorts. I have miserable physical stamina and strength, clinical depression that I have to take certain substances with to keep at bay, severe obsessive compulsive disorder that I have to this day am still in therapy in, drug cravings, not the best looks along with most girls either hating me just by me talking to them and being around them or flat out being ignored totally or just friends but I consider myself somewhat intelligent (though my intellect is nothing brilliant especially after my mind has been dulled due to substance abuse for years).

I would appreciate anybody telling me what I should do."
I self harmed again,2,mke7yo,3,"I self harmed again after quite a while I'm not sure how long maybe a year. I used to do it everyday in middle school but I slowed down significantly after my sophomore year of high school. Last time I ""relapsed"" (if u can call it that) I didn't get what I wanted from it and it didn't make me feel different. This time was different and I want to do it more tomorrow. Why did this happen? Why do I keep coming back to this? What does it mean that I don't want to stop?"
I’m a washup at the age of 19,1,mkh7du,4,"how did i let this happen? I was doing so well, I was so happy for myself, graduating early, winning so many awards at school, my teachers thought I was a protege, a prized and gifted in the talent I worked extremely hard in, and now im jobless, I cant go to school again, and can hardly leave my room. I’m so fucking mad at myself. I let everyone who ever believed in me down because I am too sick in the fucking head to do anything worthwhile. My life is over and I can’t even whimper in pain because I’m so ashamed with how it all was over so fast. I’m sorry. I never wanted this. I was so excited to become an adult, to start working my ass off to prove how good I am, to find the love of my life and get married, to have a family,  but I’ll never experience that. I’ll never leave this place. I’m trapped. No matter how much therapy, medication, hormone stabilizers, it doesn’t matter. I’m bound to be miserable until I die, the only way I’ll ever be aloud happiness."
I want to stop taking my antidepressants,1,mkh78u,2,"They make me feel nothing. I don't feel sadness, sure, but I also don't feel excitment or joy. I want to stop, and after looking into it, I've realized that there's no clear answer as to how to do it. Everywhere says to NOT quit cold turkey, but doesn't explain how to do it otherwise. Do I take one every few days? Every two days?"
Are some people actually happy in life?,11,mk583k,3,"I’ve felt constantly worried and down for so many years, I can’t imagine people waking up every day with a positive attitude. People that don’t fantasise about dying someday. It’s so foreign to me."

I can't go outside, I have no one to spend my time with or it's raining all the, I can't do any sports outside and inside too because of my small house I'm living in. I can't afford any gym or anything, actually, everything is closed for almost a year because of this fuckin virus. In my house is the same, I can't find my self in my family,  one day I laugh with my parents or talk to them like a normal human begin and the next day is only screaming and arguing suck at everything too, my grades are horrible and I have no interest and even if I find something interesting it is either too expensive or impossible to achieve (for ex. I always wanted to work on some astronomy but telescopes are so expensive and I  can't afford it or It's impossible to see anything in the ""city"") I literally spending by days died and not begin alive.

Sinking on foreign soil,3,mkbs4s,2,"My husband is struggling to keep up with my emotions....and quite frankly so am I. One minute I'm elated and going a million miles an hour and  then out of nowhere BOOM....I'm struggling to do anything and crying in the shower. I relocated out of my home country and haven't been able to see any of my family or friends for over 2 years now. I finally started settling into life here and then had to move again and everything is so overwhelming. I just cannot get out of this pit of misery. I want to be grateful for the life that I have but my mind won't let me. My husband is trying to understand but he really struggles to deal with my rollercoaster moods. It's like an endless cycle of guilt too because I feel bad for feeling like this. The good old ""people have it way worse"" guilt. Anyway, just needed to be heard....thanks for listening."

I’m going to kill myself I think,21,mjzf53,12,"Reading on google that you should check yourself into a psychiatric hospital if you 1. Are activley contemplating suicide or 2. If you can not control your mood swings, the overall gist being that if you're going to hurt someone or yourself, you have to go bye-bye.

I dont know what is going on with my brain, before I can even comepelty wake up all I can think about is how much I want to kill myself and what the mecanism of todays compilation is. 

I know it gets better, its gotten better before, but I’ve never been doing this bad consistently for a long long time and its scary, I want to kill myself, I want to die, but I also understand that there is so much to life that I would like to experience, it’s just unfathomably difficult to want to exist long enough to experience them."
My stuffed animals and pets are my only friends.,9,mk5a01,2,"I'm starting to feel ok with it! Honestly they aren't just objects to me anymore, they are sentient beings. If i talk to them they talk back, i love them because they don't judge me . They have personalities.

My pets are the same, i love them very much. My two cats will lie down next to me if i am crying . And my stuffed friends accompany me too. Something 'real' people won't do.

I know this is creepy to some people but i don't give a shit. Nobody cares about me, so why should i care what they think. Yes i do believe my friends have sentience, I don't see anything wrong with that. Except, maybe the fact that i am losing my sense of reality, But i don't care. I've been alone for so long that i need to make my friends myself.

Sorry for this unsettling post, i just needed to get this off my chest. I plan on getting more friends and just covering my bed with them."
Depression paradox(?),2,mkdlkc,4,"I'm not really sure to call this a paradox, and I've never actually told anyone, not even my therapist this, but does anyone else relate to the feeling of hating yourself, but then hating that you hate yourself, im trying to put it into words work with me here. But it's like you get pissed at yourself but then when you do start to say those terrible things about yourself, you say to just stop being a baby, you're fine, but then hate those thoughts as well? Like you just don't deserve those thoughts, or the thoughts of not deserving them. If you're able to understand me, hopefully someone can relate, thanks for listening to my rambles."
Cant wait to kill myself,20,mk073l,12,"My death will be glorious, the end of all my suffering. I hate life so much. Been depressed like 9-10 years. Other mental illnesses too. Extreme social anxiety. I look much younger and in result no one ever finds me attractive, but mainly due to me being so quiet and boring. I have no soul, im just a wasted human. Too often suicide is on my mind. I think life is stupid. Why the fuck would I work for 70+ years while being mentally ill, having no partner to come home to, nothing is enjoyable, lots of suicidal thoughts, never happy. Why. Life is so cruel, constantly I gotta see people with much better external lives. Internally yea, people have it worse maybe but I can't see it being much worse. I'm so useless, undesireable, and dont give me the bs that I didn't try. I've worked out for years, tried therapy/meds/yoga/mediation/pyschedelics/positive thinking/reading/trying new things/putting myself out there/talking to people/venting etc. Fuck off honestly. Fuck your stupid ass dr phil advice I fucking hate this existence. If God exists its evil as fuck too. Life is hell. I hate this life"

Suicide hotline experience,2,mkdhnl,1,(My experience is different from others I am not encouraging people to not use this hotline This is the rant of my own personal experience)  seems like people don’t give a fuck about your experiences. I talk to some lady earlier and I vented a little bit to her and it just seem like she did not care the entire time I was venting to her literally crying it just seems like she wasnt interested she just wanted to go home I don’t know like if some of y’all experienced people how to suicide room which is similar to this color but I tried calling back after she left it was put on hold about 15 minutes and by the time I got somebody in the line they told me to call back in a little bit. I don’t know about you but if I was really suicidal I would’ve just taken my wife right now like yeah I want to dieKill myself for it but I know there’s probably people out there who want to do it more than I do and the fact that that line this was a miserable failure makes me wonder who even fucking cares about people like us?

Favorite video games are being remastered and released in over a month and it keeping me afloat.,7,mk7en0,11,"Any reason to keep going is a good reason even if it is a video game. I already preordered it and pre downloaded it and it’s 3 games so it’s gonna take me a while to get through them. That gives me months to find the next thing to be excited about. My wife and family are the main reasons I keep my head up but I find it’s always better to have one more thing even as superficial as a new game, show, movie, or book so you can look at the future and smile a bit."

I don’t want to feel anymore,2,mkd8v3,1,I dont want to feel sad or scared or anxious or nervous anymore. I am tired of worrying I’ll be abandoned or that I’m not good enough or pretty enough or funny enough or anything enough to be loved. I know I’m supposed to find my own self worth but I can’t. I just want it to be over. I want to feel nothing because I feel too much and nobody else even cares. I want something real but it doesn’t exist and I’m too naive and idealistic  to understand that. I’m just always gonna feel alone and I want to fade away
My mind is so cloudy lately,3,mkb3m9,1,"I’m having trouble remembering a lot of things. Think I didn’t take my meds today, and didn’t want to risk doubling my dose. Anyways I’ve felt euphoric all day. Felt really happy looking at the sky, spending time with a friend lately, where I am in life. It came crashing down fast though. Every night it’s always the worst of thoughts in my head really. Really nothing nice or nothing that makes me happy lasts in life I know all of this is going to end, it has before and I’ll be left feeling so empty again. 

I don’t know why I keep writing these posts even but there is a small comfort in yelling into the void like this for nobody to see."
Depression Relapse - Needing Help,3,mkb1rt,2,"Hi All

I'm having the first proper relapse into my depression for about a year. In essence, a break-up is the closest reason for this but it's made me reflect on everything else and it's just spiralling out of control a bit.

Of course there are good days, but most days I just feel this indescribable weight on my shoulders that I just can't escape from. I've always been a high-functioning depressed person but it's honestly getting harder and harder to get up out of bed or do anything anymore. I'm sorta losing joy in the things I used to enjoy doing and its harder to get these incredibly mean, self-biting thoughts out of my head. 

I just feel super lonely and inadequate. I'm on the verge of tears most days and it's honestly getting harder to just cope day-to-day. 
I'm starting to think that maybe just being depressed and melancholy is a part of my personality, but I don't know anymore.

I'm not suicidal (I was about 2 years ago but I've dealt with that comprehensively), so there's always a bright side, I guess. 

I guess I'm just looking for some advice on how to cope. I'm still seeing my psych but I would really appreciate any additional advice if people have them :)"
I really wish I surrounded myself with better role models/friends when I was in my late teens/early twenties.,4,mk9e02,3,"I feel like a lot of my self loathing tendencies that come with depression wouldn’t be as bad as they are today if I surrounded myself with better people. I had it pretty rough growing up which I won’t get into, but the friends I made and people I surrounded myself with in my early adulthood created a framework for my identity that stuck with me for a long time. By this I mean I hung out with older people who went to bars constantly and sexual assault was common due to alcohol inebriation and the girls I hung out with were always craving male attention, whether it be good or bad. I also worked in the restaurant industry for many years which can be pretty toxic. When you surround yourself with people who don’t treat themselves well, it drains you too. I wish I knew this when I was younger."
Null (random rant),2,mkd357,0,"I’m hopeless right now. I can’t do the things I love anymore without feeling empty. I can’t smile for more than 5 seconds. I’m buried in expectations from my parents to be a perfect student. I run back and forth between practice and school. I can’t sleep for longer than hours at a time. I can’t sit still and enjoy life without being interrupted by thoughts or people. Each day I grow numb to my emotions and I push the people I enjoy away. I just want to feel someone next to me or to just have a hug or something, Jesus. I just want to feel something other than the heart beat in my chest or the shaking of my hands."

Finally getting help!,2,mkcwna,0,"About 2 months ago, I knew I needed to seek help because if I hadn’t, I probably wouldn’t be here right now! Depression and anxiety runs on my moms side of the family. I found a therapist by myself and she helped recommend a psychiatrist. I’ve been on anti-depressants for about a month now and couldn’t be happier! My family has seen me happier and will continue seeking help! Never give up! Life is precious and sweet, and short that there are people to help! I’ve been through depression for about 10 years, being 25 now, I’m gonna live life to the fullest 😝"

Just a thought,2,mkcu7b,1,"Most people won’t kill themselves because they think of all the people who would get heartbroken if they died.
Its very selfish to think that way if you think about it but I think everyone still uses that selfishness to keep themselves alive for as long as possible.
Then there’s people who was given the gift to know that nothing you will ever do is going to  matter. The people with this much freedom commits suicide."

I really just want someone who I can get in the car and go for a ride with. I want someone who I can just lay there and talk to and not feel like I’m really bothering them, but I haven’t had that for a long time and it’s getting draining. 

I recently turned 18 and it’s made me realize that I’m not going to be a teenager soon, I’m officially an adult and I don’t have a single irl friend. I don’t see people one on one anymore, and haven’t in over 3 months. 

I guess I’m more lonely then depressed, but I just want someone irl, I just don’t know how to interact. There aren’t clubs near me. I’m not in school, I can’t keep a job due to anxiety issues. 

I’m just exhausted of being alone."

Now I don't even care, the only reason why I think about stopping is the questions I'll get if people see my scars.I just don't care about myself anymore, I don't care about the harm I'm doing to myself cause I just don't feel like I have anything in me worth the effort anymore."
"Depression has robbed me of everything. Friends, family, my career.",3,mkacmh,2,"My depression has always been there but has worsened over the past 7 years and throughout that time I’ve lost everyone except my poor long-suffering partner. I can barely get myself out of bed (and god forbid to shower) - let alone nurture relationships. It’s meant I’ve had to drop out of medical school.

My partner would be so happy without me, all I cause him is misery and I hate myself beyond compare for this. He is such a wonderful, kind and generous soul - he deserves so much better, he deserves the world. The best person I’ve ever met. Anyone else would have run miles years and years ago, but he’s too kind for his own good. I don’t deserve him. Everyday I think about how me leaving this world would be the best thing for him.

I hit rock bottom a very long time ago and I don’t know how much longer I can stay here.

Thanks for reading, I just had to vent."
really been struggling lately,2,mkcdfg,0,i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about a year ago but i’ve been struggling with it for much longer. eventually i learned how to deal with in on my own so that i don’t hurt myself or make self destructive decisions but recently it’s been getting bad again. something will very slightly trigger me and then i get into a mood for a few days or maybe a few weeks. this usually entails distancing myself from things i enjoy doing and people i might normally enjoy being around and just feeling empty and sad. i try and get help by talking to people about how i’m feeling but i just get so tired of getting the same responses and then feeling worse about myself. i just feel really lost and i’m wondering if anyone can tell me how they deal with this (also i’m on escitalopram)

No one can hear me,2,mkc777,1,"Nobody. Not my family, friends (hahaha i ghosted them all), or my therapist. I'm sick of it all.

I guess it has something to do with the way i am. I'm stubborn and insecure and i'm just tired of it all. I'm 18 and i live with my grandparents and mom. I have no job, i dont go to school. I hate myself. I live with my abuser. My dad left me.

I'm constanlty being reminded of how bitter and useless i am. I have a nasty codependent relationship with my mom. My grandma nitpicks at everything i do.

I hate my skin. I just want to tear apart my skin just so i wont feel so fucking trapped. My mood swings are crippling and it hurts so fucking bad and i can't even tell anyone without feeling like a burden. Its not that no one cares. Its more like people want you act like everything is fine so it doesn't inconvience them. For my dad i have to shut the fuck up because 'its life'. 

For my therapist its those DBT skills they act like is so fucking legendary. Everyone around me is telling me to not let this 'sickness' or depression get in the way in my life. To me its like telling someone with a broken leg to not let that get in the way of running. Like what the fuck? I don't let depression affect aspects of my life IT JUST DOES. I try to do things to make it less painful and i just can't do this anymore. I'm sick of myself. Of being surronded by the same four walls. Knowing this post is going to get lost and i can't really blame anyone for it. No one wants to hear someone bitch about how fucked up their life is. But i'm doing it anyway. I have a cringy tumblr vlog i use to write out all my violent thoughts about myself."
Thought about sucide but I don’t want to die.,2,mkc6if,8,"So when I was first diagnosed September 2019, I had thought about suicide. I never attempted it. I never wanted to really die. I thought about how I could. I took note of all the pills in my house. How I could easily overdose with my bottles of epilepsy medication and my moms attanilal. I counted pills I had left. I thought how I could run to the beach and go in the ocean. I could jump of a roof. But I never tried. I never attempted it. I wanted to be alive. I had people I loved that loved me. I had music. Now a bf. I had a job I liked. But I still thought about suicide. I wrote a song today about this. I know this is kinda ranty, but has anyone had a similar  experience, any advice? Thanks. I thought I was doing really well with my depression, but I guess not."

What is everyone hiding?,2,mkc3f7,2,There’s no way I’m in the same way of the way things are as people that I can see. Everyone is in on something I’m not able to know. I know everyone else knows why the admin think I don’t know that they are lying. There’s something I’ve forgotten that explains why none of these things make any sense. Do you understand? There’s a short story where they take kids that are useless because they missed a few notes playing the piano or some other shit and do a surgery called unwinding where they take apart the body bit by bit while the person is alive and then use all the parts for transplants. Maybe they’re unwinding me. Maybe the admin told my psychiatrist that I haven’t published shit so he started adjusting three drugs at once to nuke my brain so they can unwind it. Put my neurons in a student that works right and knows whatever it is that the humans are hiding from me. Please help me make sense. I don’t have anyone to help me. If I tell my psychiatrist he’ll send the police to ruin my life. I don’t know how to get out. I just want everything to stop.
I’m back at it again,2,mkc3ci,3,"Have been on 5 depression medication and I’m on number 6 right now. 3 different anxiety meds also.

Every fucking time I swear I feel better for a while and then back in the hole. I’m on meds for bipolar disorder rn but haven’t been diagnosed. My dreams are better than reality and I feel like a lazy sack of shit. Back and fourth over and over, friends barely talk to me and I feel lonely. The worst is when I try to do things to make me feel better and it has literally no effect on how I feel. That really brings me down even worse. Feel like there’s a god damn rat in my brain shitting and pissing and clawing away and eating my brain and burrowing in so I don’t feel shit and hate myself. Welp that’s all I got."

"I’m stuck (vent) (tw: rape, abuse)",2,mkc19l,3,"I’m transgender and have been struggling with depression since I was a kid. I was abused growing up after my mom died from cancer when I was 3 years old. At 10, I moved in to my grandmas house where her husband raped me dozens of times. I’m now 17 and have 2 months left before I am kicked out and have to pay 400 dollars each month (I have no job.) the reason I’m being kicked out is because of being a slightly messy person due to depression.  I recently got top surgery and was prescribed anti depressants. I cleaned up my act and my room, and still it’s not enough. I have no where to go no one wants me. I’m stuck in a hard place with no hope."
Apathy,2,mkbyl3,1,"My boyfriend of 7 months broke up with me half a week ago. I cried every night and talked to him over the phone every night. I was incredibly broken hearted.

I can't go to parties because I will ruin the mood for sure, I won't be able to make the person I love happy... I can't stop thinking that any person would do better than me. That also makes me jealous and I don't want to, I don't fuckin want to think that way of my friends. I know that I'm a piece of shit but at least I don't want to be a jealous piece of shit."
I can't watch romance anime,6,mk6pif,3,"I can't watch romance anime.

I'm a 19-year-old Swedish guy and I can't watch romance anime anymore. Anytime I try it just gives me something close to a panic attack and the feeling of dread over the fact that I've missed out on any kind of romance and won't ever experience anything like that hurts a lot. It doesn't even apply only to especially romance anime. Every time I see in any type of show a kind of romantic relationship i have to shut it off.

And from what I've experienced isn't this something I can fix like my personality. It's from the simple fact that I'm just really fucking ugly. If you wanna have a reference point I'm a worse-looking blond version of the person you will see if you google blackopscel which makes me just feel hopeless.

Can't seem to feel happy,2,mkbtns,1,"So, a bit of background first. I'm 33, 3 children (oldest turns 6 on Tuesday), diagnosed/suggested that I have persistent depressive disorder from a therapist in college, I work nights for my local 911 dispatch, and I have never attempted suicide but have come close to forming a plan before.

I go through cycles of up and down like anyone else but, with the above mentioned persistent depression, I seem to have more lows than highs. And, it seems, like I'm stuck in a rather persistent rut lately. There's all sort of things to be happy about too. Like I've taken some big steps to get my personal finances in a much better place (things I've been wanting to do for a long time), I'm on the verge of getting promoted, had a conversation with my wife recently about how we're the most confident in our relationship we've ever been. 

But whenever I think about all of these reasons I should be happy I get this sad sinking feeling. I'm the type of person that wants to talk about it but don't feel like I have anyone I can go to. I don't want to throw my wife under the bus, because she's an awesome person and an awesome wife, but being able to provide catharsis for my persistent sadness had never been something I've been able to go to her about, just not one of her strong points. Kids introduce so much stress, it's normal but doesn't mean it's any easier. The house is persistently messy and neither my wife not myself are the studious types to keep up on it, although I've become increasingly more anal and frustrated by the fact that I am and have always lived like a slob.

As for work, my sleeping schedule is entirely inconsistent. I work a rotating schedule, switch back to a normal sleep schedule for my days off, I work a lot of holidays which I hate. Not a lot I can do about it though.

Anyways, just looking for some encourage/sympathy."
i'm just trying a wiser person to help back on the right track,3,mk9jgi,1,I really want to talk to somebodu
Can’t seem to find happiness in myself or other things it’s getting to me,2,mkbrik,1,I’ve had depression since I was 13 I’m now turning 19 and feel like absolutely nothing has changed in me I’ve been to hospitals I’ve taken all the medication but I still feel like life is not for me I am an extra here and I’ve started to care less and less about everyone around me which scares me sometimes I don’t know what to do anymore I hate life .
"I never really thought myself to really get depressed, but recently I just... realized how bad it was",2,mkbqln,1,"My dad has had me help him with his hobby/job and I only focused on it because it was absolute shit, but what with me turning 18 I’ve finally had time to look at myself, and I don’t know if I know what to do"
I know it's over,2,mkblvj,1,"My best friend of 20 years has abandoned me. She did not care about my mental health. I tried to get passed that, but she held all the cards and decided it wasn't worth it apparently. Now I'm just sad all the time.

I feel like going to therapy made me feel worse,17,mjyi7c,6,"I don't like the fact that they have to mention about how the pandemic is affecting everyone, not just me. That does not matter to me as I have always been like this to begin with.

I lack motivation to do anything. And I dislike interacting with my parents even more. Just today they  had me talk with my mother and never have I felt such disgust in a very long time. I have not improved, not even the slightest. I even picked up my binge-eating habit while at it, which is not their fault but I am setting an example here for my worsen habits. I have four more weeks until I won't be seeing them, so I texted them if I can seek out a psychiatrist instead. 

Therapy isn't really for me and now I got to know after months of tiring sessions."
Why is everything so exhausting with depression?,7,mk50b8,1,"I don’t think my dad understands how much energy it takes to do basics as someone who is depressed. Ive put on so much weight in the last year. Partly because i cant motivate myself to exercise, but also I’m struggling to shower daily and take medication, never mind plan and cook healthy meals. Why does taking care yourself seem so hard? And how can i explain this to someone who loves me, but i think doesn’t understand."
I don’t know whats going on with me,1,mkelc6,1,"I don’t know if i’m depressed or not but recently I feel like there is really no point in trying at anything anymore. I don’t feel like myself, no, i feel like I never knew who I was in the first place. These thoughts all started when my childhood dog died while I was at college. I had him for 16 years and when he died I didn’t know how to feel. I was emotionally numb. I was sad for a while as anyone should be, but it didn’t feel real. I was afraid that I was just pretending to be sad, because thats just what people did when they were sad. Then I realized everything I have done up to this point in my life is all fake. I never showed my true personality to my family. I have always put up a facade anytime I’m with other people. When i’m not with others, i’m working to better keep up this facade that I’m doing well and that I’m happy. I pretend to have a personality but I don’t even know myself. I’ve been running on autopilot all my life, living like some kind of npc doing everything just to avoid conflict. Looking back, I realize I’ve never truly felt happy in my life and my emotions don’t seem as vibrant as others. Rather, they’re dull and I feel as if i’m in a consistent state of indifference. Now I see how empty of a life I seemed to have lived. I feel like I’m in a prison, never able to be myself because I’m trapped in a living body. I want to know what it feels like to be happy, but nothing I would do would ever seem to achieve this. All my aspirations and goals are empty, I just seem to copy those around me. At the same time, I sometimes think that maybe it would’ve been better if I didn’t have such emotions in the first place. I wish that I just disappear, but I don’t have the conviction to do so yet. I wish that someday, i will gain the conviction to do so myself, but I would not die before my parents."

I don’t want to be this weak. I want to be strong. For them. Why does being alone hurt so much. I don’t know how much longer I can last for. Tomorrow isn’t going to be better. Sooner or later I’ll have to give up. Sooner or later it’ll break me. Sooner or later I’ll die. At least then everyone can be happy."
dont have motivation/energy for anything at all,4,mk77i2,2,"i only really have motivation to play videogames and watch youtube, but thats really it. i wanna do alot of other stuff like programming, but i just cant be bothered enough to do it. even thinking about forcing myself to do it feels immediately draining and i just cant handle that feeling so i end up just not doing anything. sometimes i cant even get myself to play videogames and i end up in a limbo of watching random youtube videos even tho i actually wanna play some game or even do programming. or even further i sometimes just cant even get the motivation to move at all in any way, as even the thought of it feels draining and i just wait there collecting enough energy to just click a button once. its really painful and the only things i can do outside of what i already said is fueled by things like my ocd, causing me to write this whole post as a form of compulsion. hhhh i just wanna do... stuff"
Ever get angry when people ask how you're doing?,3,mk8u2m,1,"How often do you neglect friends, family, partners for days or more and then when you realize you're not going to have anyone to talk to when you feel better and finally feel the obligation to interact with people, they start with some absurdly boring shit that makes you regret reaching out? Or worse, they ask how I'm feeling or go straight to ""what's wrong?"" because it's obvious to them I'm not ok but not obvious that I don't want to talk. Odd; starting a conversation when you REALLY don't want to talk. Haha. Fuck."
"I Think ""I Don't Want To Be Alive Anymore"" Multiple Times A Day",2,mkb2rm,2,"I don't know why I'm bothering. I told my doctor and therapist I keep having these thoughts. It's frustrating because my depression wasn't always like this. I want off my medication. Off this fucked up thinking. Off the depression. Just let me go. 

I don't want to die but I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm tired of this pain. I'm tired of everyone and everything. Nothing has meaning. I have no joy, nothing to look forward to. Money means nothing. 

I'm happiest when I'm asleep. Once I wake up and realise who I am, that's when the depression hits. Why can't I just sleep forever? Why can't I just sleep at least 24 hours? Just let me dream. Let me enjoy the characters in my head. Just drift away. Some place better.

And what happens when covid is over? I go back to working in an office I hate? Driving an hour in traffic, working a job I hate only to go to bed and do it over again 5 days a week. Then on the weekend because I'm so exhausted with humans I just spend time away from people and relax. Until the Sunday scaries come back and ruin me. At least this pandemic has given me more time to be happy. I never want to go back to ""normal"". 

I just want to be happy but every attempt I make brings me a step closer to fucking depression. How the fuck does medication + therapy give you the opposite reaction? This is like giving chemo for cancer but the cancer grows stronger. I wish I never tried to think I could rid of you depression. I was better before I tried. Better before I could think about a time of what the fuck even is happy. I deserve to be dead. 

Feeling hurts. My skin is so sensitive. Every touch feels meaningless.

I never experience good. I only experience bad or nothing. But hey at least the medication and therapy are going to trick my brain into thinking it's all right! 

Please just end the pain. Heal me of this depression. It's been a decade. Just please. Let me go. Let me go depression. Let me ..."
Maybe I’m just a lone wolf.,19,mjyhdj,32,"I don’t really think I was made to have people. I don’t really have anyone close to me or ever really had. I was always that least favorite friend for some reason. I stopped talking to my friends for bout a year. Nobody really ever checked up on me or talked to me but I wasn’t expecting to. Nobody would to someone you’re not close to. 

The only people I could say are close people are my family member like my parents and brothers and sisters. But even then I sometimes feel they hate me. I feel they’d be better off without me. 

The only person who I ever truly felt a real connection with was my ex. But she left me for a bs reason that wasn’t my fault. Three months later and I think she’s seeing someone else. I knew her in real life but we dated long distance because we lived in different continents. But she was going to come back soon so we waited. But broke up with me before we came back. Meaning I never saw her, never hugged her, never kissed her. 

I sometimes feel I’m cursed. Like nothing I have ever done in life ever turned out Ok. Even the most basic things I planees turned out shit. Maybe some people weren’t made for this. I think to myself all the time if I’m a good person. For my whole life I thought I was a good person. Or at least I really tried to be. But I’m starting to think I’m a shit person. Maybe that’s why I’m cursed. 

I really appreciate anyone who read this far."

I’m tired to cry,1,mke9hz,0,"Well, on April 2019 I met this guy 
He was the first person who I said “I love you” he was my first love I felt so peacefully with him but the nightmare just start beginning.
8 months later we broke up for firs time, gosh I cried all day and night my mind was in white, I couldn’t accept that he wasn’t with me anymore, he cheated on me the times that he wanted and I was so blind that I didn’t accept it I couldn’t afforded it I loved him more than me and my family, and well you should wondering “was he so handsome?” Gosh no, no way, all my friends said me the same thing, he was the ugliest person you can know but well that’s not the case. However, he hit me some times, he made offensives comments about me and my body, he always blamed me for all the wrong things on OUR relationship, but well. We broke up and come back since more than 7 months, but today... He met another girl, and he stated to date her... and he looks so happy... 
he destroyed me, he made me so fucking insecure about myself, he’s the worst person I know... but I still loving him... he caused me depression, I took pills for that shit, and he just dating another girl... i loved him... it was a honest love, the most beautiful love you can think, and he just go... now I’m just in a bed, thinking what is wrong with me...

Career success stories with chronic pain and mental illness?,3,mk8dp8,0,"I'm a 22 year old that has lived with severe mental health problems since I was a kid and then developed chronic pain and fatigue issues as a teen. I have chronic pain in both arms that makes anything involving my hands/arms painful, especially repetitive movements. I have to take frequent breaks with whatever I'm doing before the pain/fatigue gets too much. If they get out of hand then it triggers pain flares and depressive and dissociative episodes. All the fun stuff.

So essentially the ideal work environment would be somewhere quiet (preferably at home), self paced, and part time. I'd like to actually work towards a career, not just jobs to get by, you know? I love art, nature, food, and animals. It took me 5 years just to get an associates in Psychology because I had so many set backs. By the end of it I was so burnt out and my mental health so bad that I didn't feel like pursuing my Bachelor's in that field. I love school and learning but I've had to drop classes almost every semester because of pain or a depressive episode. It's hard not to feel hopeless and terrified every time I think about the future.

Does anyone here have any success stories? Thank you for the help!"
My only friend I have known for 9 years is completely ignoring me,1,mke2pi,5,"     This shouldn't be fucking with me, but he just leaves me on read and hangs up calls immediately. I can't stop feeling like its my fault, its been 2 months. He was the only person I would ever talk to so I've just been super lonely sitting in my room. I just feel completely useless, and I feel like shit for thinking that people should have to talk to me."
Worst thing about feeling better is realizing your spouse is no longer interesting,2,mkafcm,10,"She is gentle, she is caring, she is loving. She stands beside me time and time again when things are bad. I like spending time with her. I like hugging her, kissing her, loving her. But life has become dreadfully boring. TV, movies and books. Or she does her arts and crafts. I want to get out and do adventurous things. Outdoors stuff, nature stuff. Climbing and hiking and go carts. Excitement, daring. I want to learn sports shooting. I want to go off roading, axe throwing. I look at other women our age, other wives our age and they do fun stuff. Sure I could do all those things myself but I would rather do them with my wife, my life partner. So each time I get feeling better I only get feeling worse."
Depressed About Ex of 12 Years Having Baby,2,mkaei9,1,"Some background about me:

I’ve only had one girlfriend in my life and we dated for 7 months while I was in college 12 years ago. She dumped me and it was horrible but eventually I started dating again and began to get over her, or so I thought.

Flash forward to about a month ago when I found out that she and her husband had a baby and for some reason it just killed me emotionally. 

I’ve been anxious and depressed ever since. Is this an understandable reaction to anyone? What can I do to move past this? I haven’t been this depressed since we actually broke up in 2009."
Just Blogging for Self Post-Smoking,3,mk7za4,0,"Sort of a cross between here and r/leaves, but damn it's just a strange moment in time.

Recently got terminated after I gave a verbal two weeks notice, but I saw it coming, so it didn't matter. Sometimes it just hurts being told to go home. Eligible for unemployment because I never put it in writing, but that's not even the point. I've constantly been in a cycle of smoking pot to sort of mask these feelings I'm currently feeling. 

""I am full of emptiness"" is just a repetitive thing to feel. Constantly doubting what I want to do. Picked up sketching, but no interest in past few weeks. I start, but then realize I am only doing things so that I'll become ""the greatest"". I have such a big ego and no matter how much I acknowledge it, it is so hard to ignore it and just do things to enjoy things. I am constantly in a rut of wanting to become the best at whatever I do. Not like I show this, but if I feel like I'm wasting my time not working to become the best of whatever I do, then what is the point? I know the point is to just enjoy myself, but that seems like such a waste. My head is the biggest enemy, it keeps me back so much. 

It is so hard to just live life. I've constantly had these dull and numbed out feelings that my safest place in the world is in my dreams, which is so strange, because that's the source of all my problems; my head isn't it? 

I used to be able to just smoke and  find enjoyment to my activities, but now whenever I stop smoking to try and enhance or further myself..I become stuck, dull, boring. In front of people I'm just a machine of humor, and it feels so real when I'm with people. Take me away from socializing, take me away from working, and now I feel like absolutely garbage. These are normal things and I get it, but my therapist doesn't do much other than listen. I wish he would ask me questions or make me think in ways I can't, but I am constantly being a devil's advocate to every decision and everything I do. In the vicious cycle of depression and anxiety I am the quickest person to instantly punish myself; even if the sketches are great, or even if the video game finds its course...If I can tell the pattern I tell myself in some way that its pointless to go on because, of course, ""I have figured it out""...Even if I haven't figured it out, it just feels that way and pushing on more just becomes so uncomfortable.

  
Everything is so uncomfortable. 

I wish you all the best; stay safe and stay human."

Birthday,1,mkdpgm,0,My bday was yesterday it was a good day but to see how time flies bye and how many people were left in my past just killed me. I’ve been growing numb lately and I just wanted to talk to one person the whole day they were busy and then when I did have the chance they didn’t respond.

Help,2,mka2gc,0,"I’m borderline homicidal and suicidal, every time I “accidentally” hurt my dogs I grab a knife and start cutting my chest so no one will be able to tell I self-harm. My dogs are literally the only thing in this entire world I care about and yet I hurt them and after it happens all I care about is death. I start banging my head against the wall and crying uncontrollably and the worst part about is my dog consoles me after. Even when I’m not depressed all I think about suicide or some form of death and or homicide to pass the time. I don’t care about taking any sort of medication or going to therapy I just need someone to tell me how to end is instantly I would prefer no pain whatsoever but pain is acceptable as long as it’s instantaneous."
How do you find a new hobby as an adult?,6,mk3hn5,8,"I'm at a loss in my life. I am back at the point I was ten years ago, and all the ""progress"" I made has been washed away. I have no friends and no prospects. I don't find joy in anything anymore. I work from home and eat and sleep and that's my whole existence. How do you go about finding a hobby to give yourself purpose in life when I have no interest in anything? I can't even play the same video games or watch tv, I find joy in literally nothing but sleep; because sleep is when I don't feel. 

I'm not artistic at all, I'm overly critical of anything I create. I'm not ""exercise for fun"" guy. I like to cook good food but I have no friends to share it with let alone being in a pandemic when no one can get together anyways. I wish so much to not exist anymore, but I'm too afraid to even attempt suicide. I feel so useless and helpless and I'm at the end of my rope."
"i want to see it get better, but it’s so bad that i don’t know if i can wait any longer",3,mk7p3t,1,"i really do want to see it get better, see myself be happy and not wish i was dead . i want to get to a point where i’m comfortable with who i am, and know who i am , and feel important. i want to get to a point where i don’t wake up and wish i had died in my sleep. i want to get to a point where there are more good days than bad. i want to get to a point where when something goes wrong, it isn’t something that tips me over the edge. i want to get to a point where simple tasks like showering and brushing my teeth aren’t daunting. i want to get to a point where i’m eating well and i’m happy with my weight. i want to get to a point where i enjoy things again. i want to get to a point where i have more energy to do things rather than waste my days in bed. i want to get to a point where i’m not crying myself to sleep. i want to get to a point where i’m not feeling so guilty about being in a relationship because i’m mentally ill. i want to get to a point where things are better but i’ve been holding on and waiting and waiting and it feels like that point will never come . i don’t know if i can hold on for much longer, and it feels like this point will never come"
I wish I could look towards the future again,2,mk9x0x,2,"This year has been a train wreck. My mental health is in the absolute worst state it’s ever been. I even attempted suicide. I honestly wonder why I’m still here. Everyday is just a struggle of trying to feel okay. Even slight inconveniences feels like less of a reason to live. 

Before, I always had goals to work towards that kept me somewhat sane. Now I have no goals. No relationship goals because me and my partner are rocky to say the least. We’re in a bit of a better spot now and I want to trust him, but I can’t help but fear I’ll end up hurt for the millionth time. My partner also fears the future and we both want different things. I want to work towards living together and more down the line and I worry he doesn’t want that any time soon. 

I also have no job goals because I put all of my eggs into one basket like an idiot and got turned down from my dream opportunity, and now I have no fall back plan. I have no moving goals as I don’t want to live with my parents (they’re abusive) but also not in my partners parents house because I feel like I’ll only cramp the place up. I have no future goals at all. 

As I said, I survive day by day, yet graduation from college and adulthood inches closer. And now, everyone, even relatives like uncles and grandparents, are pressuring me to figure it out. No matter what, I’ll probably lose and further lose my grip on sanity."
The Paradox of Opening up to People,3,mk5vyu,3,"Anyone else struggle with opening up about depression to people? These last few weeks have been some of my lowest in recent memory. Ironically, I have had some external success in my professional career during this stretch, but my internal mental health has just been awful.

Recently, I've often found myself just spending time alone at home and drinking. The feeling I experience of emptiness and hopelessness is nearly unbearable, which leads to me wanting to reach out to some of my friends. But this is where I've noticed a bit of a Catch-22 in this regard:

On one hand, I am lucky to have pretty supportive friends. They would want me to reach out if I am suffering. But, doing so would both (1) make me feel like a burden; and (2) likely make me regret doing so. I have opened up in the past to some of my friends and while it feels good to get some things off my chest, the net benefit I receive doesn't always seem worth it. Additionally, the resulting light they see me in changes. Their new view of me might be more accurate, but I don't know if them ""looking down"" upon me (if you will) is worth being able to get something off my chest. (Sidenote: I think the ""looking down"" reaction is the both due to the overall stigma mental health carries, as well as my specific situation -- being a depressed man in the midwest.)

On the other hand, the aforementioned feeling of regret is probably better than just continuing living through this pain alone like I am now. Maybe reaching out is shitty, but at least it's something. And just maybe will it be better than the alternative this time."
“Talk about your feelings”,8,mk1isn,4,"okay okay okay , I have an observation I guess you’d call it , so basicalllyyyy I’ve been struggling sooooo fucking horribly mentally , and that’s fine whatever but whenever I try to help myself and communicate my feelings to the people around me like my past therapist have told me , I literally get tossed to the side by EVERYONE , like the second I bring up my thoughts and feelings to anyone it’s instantly not important , idk it makes me genuinely feel like no gives a fuckk about me which is fine theyre entitled to that I guess , but then I think about how when people do actually attempt or relapse into bad coping skills how it’s alwayysss those same people to be like “check on your friends😫” or like “if you ever need to talk to ANYBODY I’m here for you” like pleassseeeeee , I can’t tell if I’m more mad or more lonely lmfao but anyways , sorry for being so angry LMFAO my feelings have been suppressed for weeekkkkssss✨ <3 I hope y’all are doing okay tho 🥺 and y’all are having a beautiful day 🥺"
Been awhile,2,mk9vlg,1,You ever feel like your just a safety deposit box for someone else.
I’ve never had a human like me,3,mk5udx,2,"Male or female, nobody has ever wanted to have any romantic contact with me in any sort. I’ve tried everything, putting myself out there, being more reserved, trying, not trying and still nobody has ever wanted me.

Has depression affected you more as you get older?,2,mk9p6d,1,"I'm 35 now and it's been like this basically nonstop since I was 13. I felt like I had reasons to be sad when I was in my 20s; shit job, few if any friends, rarely had a relationship that lasted very long, and my future looked pretty bleak in general. Now I'm married, own a home, much better job, all of the standard adult things people would expect of a man my age but I feel worse as a result. My life is objectively better but I still have these stretches of days or weeks where I really struggle. I always told myself that things would fix me; someone who loved me, a better job, not renting apartments or riding buses anymore and as a result, I felt somewhat in control of my emotions. I had convinced myself that I was sad because my life sucked basically. Now that it's clear none of those things made any difference, I realize how helpless I am and those episodes of feeling said, worthless, and withdrawing last longer and are harder to get out of. Does anyone else feel like they're sinking lower and lower as they get older?"
How to feel like myself again?,2,mk9nre,2,"I am quite new to reddit and apologise if i break any rules or anything. Id like to start off by saying I used to have depression and I turned my life around and fixed it, I was confident, got good grades, independently happy with the support of my friends and family, I started dating a guy (same age as I am) for a year and a half now. But since world events happened and I am doing online school, nothing feels the same, I'm depressed again, no longer the person I once was, failing all my classes, feel like a disappointment and I have no clue where to go or what to do. I am on a waiting list for a therapist and I don't know how to talk about these things as I don't want people to look at me differently, along top of all these problems genetic health issues are showing up and its just bringing me down more. I have considering not living, but I know its not my time to go as I want to help save more lives. I have no where to go and no one to talk to, any help or comments will be appreciated, thank you."
No matter what I do I'm still depressed,13,mjy70i,3,"Take today for example. I got up early and went out to enjoy the sunshine and do some calisthenics. I then decided to also play some football on my own and then with a few other people. Then went on to do some basketball on my own and yet I'm still bloody depressed. 

I feel no different than I did yesterday when I just spent all day on my computer playing video games and going on YouTube. 

No matter if I spend the day at work or I spend the day studying. It makes no difference. I'm just always miserable and wish it would all just end. 

Sorry, I just needed a  place to vent."
Am I really suicidal/depressed?,3,mk7bq6,3,"I sometimes wonder if I actually have depression and suicidal ideation or if that’s just an excuse to feel sorry for myself. Am I really truly depressed or do I just want to think that so I have convenient excuse to blame my failures on? Am I actually depressed or is it just a reason for me to not try in life? I think about this a lot and I hate the idea of just wanting to feel sorry for myself and not try in life.
Sorry for my very late night thoughts."

Cant seem to get out of this spiral!,1,mkd12p,4,"For the last few years, I've realized that Ive been slowly slipping deeper and deeper into a loss of control/depression. Two years ago my mother was fighting terminal cancer and in hospice here at my house. To top it off, while i was taking care of her, i also got diagnosed with testicular cancer. Unfortunately I lost my mom who was my best friend and the only true support I always had. I was fortunate enough to get through my battle and I'm currently still in remission. After that covid hit not much later and I was permanently laid off from a decent paying career of 10 years. For the last year ive been on unemployment, not searching for a job, just diving into alcohol and finding anything to take me away from this reality. I take care of my father now, and just constantly think and worry about death, being alone, not finding love, and feeling worthless. I know partying and drinking is probably a big cause of my feelings but I also am just so exhausted from all that has gone on in the last few years. Im afraid to really show true emotions to pretty much anyone. I go through these phases where I just want to be alone but once I am, i want company & vice versa. I feel so alone, I dont have a girlfriend because Im a rather wild guy and show no signs of being a good partner right now. Im an artist and even my desire to create has slowly dwindled away. All I wanna do is lay in bed and watch movies if im not out drinking. Nothing seems to matter, life is so strange, Id like to feel loved by someone but even the last girl I dated ghosted me and now my good friend is dating her. Before that my ex of 7 years cheated on me and is now married living in another state. I dont know what the point is anymore besides just wasting away. Idk this is my first post ever and I'm kinda ranting, thanks to whoever reads this. Beneath it all, there still lies some hope deep inside of me but boy oh boy its fading fast."
feeling so lonely,3,mk583y,7,"i seriously feel like i can’t talk to anyone. i feel like a burden and my problems are small. i’m legit having one of the hardest times in my life and i’m trying to get through it alone so i can feel independent. i know people won’t be there for me forever based on how they’re acting now. i text some people and they rarely answer. that’s including my sister. i’ve lost my self love and all my support. desperately trying to survive. sometimes i don’t even feel like i can tell my therapist, and they’re BEING PAID to listen to my problems. i hate myself and i wish i didn’t. i am trying to love myself but my life is so difficult right now. someone please tell me they love me and care about me. i don’t even care that you’re a stranger. i just need a virtual hug."

i absolutely have no idea what to do with my life,2,mk97he,1,i have mdd add/adhd general anxiety disorder and cannabis use disorder ;). i have no way to express myself. i hate myself and everything i try to create. if it’s music i can’t accept that it’s anything other than the juice at the bottom of a garbage bin. i just got out of a psych ward for an attempt with xanax. i just wanna go to the void i know there isn’t anything after this i just really want to leave i have bad episodes every now and then i’m on so much medication it’s putting fog around my thoughts i just broke up with my gf of 2 years just so i could have one less attachment to this world. i wanna make it easier to leave. disassociation to this world used to be how i would handle things. i would just believe i wasn’t real and nothing was real and i would be okay with that and it would make it so much easier to commit suicide and cut and do whatever i wanted. but that ended me up in a hospital. i have nowhere to go nothing to be no one to love. i’m supposed to be alone that’s what i’m here for
Question,2,mk95cc,1,Can depression be caused strictly by environmental factors?
My grandma has passed away and I don’t know what to do,2,mk941j,2,"It has been over a month and I still feel like it has happened yesterday. My family won’t even talk to each other because my grandma was all that was keeping us together. And I didn’t even cry when all of this happened, I feel an empty void. I don’t wanna leave my house. And worst of all my friends don’t understand so they can’t actually help me. Am I depressed or am I just lazy?                    Edit: grammar"
How am I supposed to tell my therapist ( sorry alot of swearing),1,mkcq3e,1,"Holy shit I feel like I'm suffocating. I almost killed myself, but I wasn't going to do it I knew I wasn't. What if next time I don't know if I am or not. I want a different life so bad. Anything, I would rather be kidnapped and trafficked across the country than this shit. How am I supposed to go to school, I can't do it. Why does all this shit have to happen right now, like just give me a fucking break. My mom fought with her boyfriend today, brought back great memories. Really makes me want to stay there. I'm getting mad at everything and getting my at myself for getting mad. My thoughts are so irrational and it infuriating. And The fucking shit covered chairy on to is my cat is missing. So in the span of 5 days I lost my cat and my dog got cancer. I have 3 e's and I'm about to fail another class. I got all the work I'm supposed to do for spring break and did none of it. Why can't I get a break. Honestly I wish I could go to a mental ward just to get a break. Sorry I'm probably gonna post like 8 more times, but tonight is gonna fucking suck."
Help,3,mk6mzr,1,"I need help.  I'm not functioning, I feel like the world is closing in on me.  It's hard to breathe, it feels like I am trying to fight against an immense pressure that is coming down on me from some unseen hydraulic press.  I feel like I'm existing in some demented dimension where morning never comes and evil rules the realm, oppressing me until I don't remember who I really am anymore.  I don't remember what it's like to actually live my life, to accomplish things, follow a routine, make plans and stick to them.  Anything I think of to do, no matter how mundane or ordinary, feels like a big, insane, wild, far-fetched pipe dream.  I can't tell what's realistic and what's not anymore.  I mean, I'm *aware* that going to the grocery store and making a doctor's appointment are perfectly normal, everyday activities, but I *feel* like they are just insane notions that would never work.  Like, I may as well hitchhike to Disneyworld to sell paintings I stole from the Museum of Contemporary Art, because that feels at about the same level of normalcy as trying to get a job in an office or a store.  I feel absolutely insane sometimes, the way everything just seems so overwhelming and huge.  I'm being pressured by everyone in my life to get a job, and it just seems so far beyond impossible.  Impossible is getting up, taking a shower, and doing errands and chores.  That's an impossible day.  Going out and getting a job, then going to work every day, on top of homeschooling and housekeeping?  That's just so entirely inconceivable that it feels like a completely foreign idea to me.  And it's not a foreign concept to me, not at all.  During times in my life when my psych disorders weren't so bad, I was a productive forceto be reckoned with.  I worked, went to school, belonged to organizations, had a busy social life, and carried extra work on my shoulders in the way of research, writing, blogging.  All on top of my home life.  And I thrived! I was productive, happy, and healthy.  But now, in the depths of this infinite abyss of depression and anxiety, the girl who did all those things, who made big plans and reached her goals, seems like someone else entirely.  Maybe someone I read about one time and admired, but could never hope to be anything like myself.  I have been trying to find some freelance writing jobs, but I haven't had any luck yet.  I've also been working on hand-painted home decor to sell on Etsy and other online retailers, but I'm still unhappy with most of my pieces.  I also signed up for Doordash, Grubhub, Instacart, and Postmates, but was unable to do any of them because they all do very extensive background checks, and I used to be a bit of a bad girl with compulsion issues concerning retail theft and substance abuse, so I have a few dark marks sullying my background.  These companies were unimpressed by that, and informed me that I would not be welcome to offer my services to them.  And, at least for the time being, that's the type of work I need.  I need a flexible, fully personalized way to make money.  If I'm working for someone else, if I'm unable to get out of bed or don't have the wherewithal to perform my job that day, I will lose the job, and gain another negative employement experience on my resume.

I don't know what to do.  I'm a mom, a very involved mom.  My son is my light, and the thing that keeps me going when nothing else seems worth anything.  He's the thing that inspires and motivates me, keeping me from falling apart entirely.  I homeschool, and he deserves to have me be healthy, alert, and whole, and I deserve to be able to enjoy watching him learn and grow, I deserve to be present and excited about the life my family lives together.  I deserve, and my family deserves, to be able to get ourselves into a better situation, to move out of my in-laws house, have our own home, our own plans, routines, and traditions.  But right now, all of that just feels so, so far away as to seem entirely impossible here and now, and highly unlikely at any point in the future as well.  Every day I wonder what's going to happen when we have to start doing things differently, when we are no longerable to live rent free.  What will become of me, will I end up on the streets?  It feels like it sometimes, though I know my husband would never let that happen to us.  

I need help, like I said.  I keep making doctor's appointments and missing them, either because I get too overwhelmed to go to them, or I forget about them entirely.  I am on medicaid, so I have to jump through all these hoops to eventually see a psychiatrist, which is not something I'm really capable of doing while I'm in the place that I'm currently in.  I keep thinking maybe I should check into the psych ward to get some therapy and get on a medication regimen, which is something I've done with much success several times in my life.  I just worry about my son's reaction to having me away in the hospital.  I don't want to leave him.

I know that it sounds like I'm whining and making excuses, and I hate that I sound that way, it's disgusting to me.  Believe me, though, I have tried gritting my teeth and hitching myself up by the bootstraps and grinding through.  I have tried the ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach.  It's not working.  I'm in the worst place I've ever been in, it's never been this bad.  In the 22 years since I've been a diafgnosed depression and anxiety sufferer, I have never suffered to this degree.  I have never felt disabled or invalidated, but I do now.  I feel like I am suffering from a terminal illness, like my days are numbered and few, like I am approaching a very dark and horrifying end.  Not suicidally, just that time is running out.  I don't want to die, I just want to stop feeling like I want to die.

I am sorry for the long, pathetic post.  Thank you for staying with me. through the whole thing.  I'm not looking for pity, I am not just here to bitch and whine and say ""poor little me, please feel bad for me.""  I swear, I'm not, though I'm totally sure that's exactly how this reads.

Really, the point of this post is that I simply can't do this anymore.  I need it to stop, I am so incredibly sick of this being my whole life.  Every single aspect of my life is influenced by depression and anxiety.  Every.  Single.  Aspect.  The big things and the tiny things.  It's exhausting, and I am at the end of my rope.  I need help, and I need it ASAFP.  I don't need it six months from now when I'm finally able to get in with a psychiatrist.  I need it right effing now.  Does anyone reading this have any suggestions for getting psychological help on an immediate basis?  Including medication.  We have a lot of behavioral and mental health outpatient programs, but they don't prescribe medication.  Not only do they not prescribe medication, you are also not allowed to be on medication while receiving services from them, because they all deal with substance abuse as well as mental health.  I need to see a psychological medical professional who can prescribe meds as well as provide therapy.  I need to know how to see one fast, fast, fast.  

Thank you in advance for any and all helpful advice."
Be careful with what you wish for,32,mjsyyg,3,"I always felt like a disappointment, always had low self esteem, always ran to weed to fix my problems.

After a knee surgery I discovered freelancing, I wanted to become the best at what I was doing. So I put all my effort in it and came out on top.

I always fantasized about being rich and knew that Bitcoin was my only chance. I was selling it along the way to buy stuff I don't need, to impress my girlfriend that Im finally doing something on my own, until I realized I could retire at 24 if I would've just pushed just a bit harder and held it.

I always loved our cat we had together, I was always thinking I just hope nothing bad happens to her, she always woke me up with snuggles, until a car hit her and she died late at night while I was busy with work.

I was always worried that my girlfriend of 7 years would cheat on me ( our 7th year anniversary was on the 14th March 2021) we were each others first love, high school sweethearts, been through thin and thick, I was filled with insecurities and always had the scenarios playing in my head. She left me for a rich, 15 year older guy two weeks after meeting him.

This all happened in the span of 3 months, I got my whole life, future taken away from me in such a short time, everything I've worked for is slowly dissapearing, people that I've loved and the pets I had since childhood are dying.

I moved back to my parents house, without a proper job, without a license for a car, Im lost, I don't know where to begin next, I don't know what to do next. And to top it of I have a little debt.

Your mind is a powerful place, learn to acknowledge this and listen to your heart. I never really believed in the ""universe has a plan for you"" thing. But looking at the past, filled with regrets there were many obvious signs showing up. Respect those signs even if it looks stupid, there's a meaning in every thing we observe. Learn from my mistakes, you don't want to get your future rug pulled by your past mistakes."
I'm worried about my life,2,mk8v5s,0,"I don't think I'm going to kill myself but last night I had a dream I cut myself again. I recently asked a girl I thought was cute for her number and surprisingly she gave my ugly ass her number. I was super worried about being 18 and her being 17 but I mean I won't have sex with her until she is 18 and she said she is still getting over her last relationship. I appreciate this because we only went out to eat once but I'm worried about not having fun when we go on our like ""dates"" and stuff because I want to get to know her better and stuff but like what if I sink in all this time and she ends up not liking me? I'm just worried and been feeling really down. I'm going on vacation soon and I am very worried about covid and I don't like my family. anyone have any way they can help?"

I feeling really depressed,3,mk6ccb,4,"Today is my last day of spring break. Holy shit it has been awful. I planned to do a lot of work, finally finish some work from a while ago to get the credits. I didn't do anything. I also had to work on a stupid current events assignment for one of my current classes. My teacher didn't explain it well, and when I asked him for help he just made me feel bad. I keep thinking about committing suicide. I don't want to, I have cats and guinea pigs, and a family. I wouldn't want them to have to deal with that. I also keep thinking about selfharm. I've been crying a lot more than usual. I don't know what to do."
I wanna get up From bed already,3,mk6cbd,3,"Spent the Last 3 days in bed, depressed and I haven't taken care of myself. Please tell me what I should do"
This is a post that should never ever have existed. I am absolutely sick of all the horrors of human existence.,6,mk345a,0,"As the coronavirus pandemic is beginning to hopefully fade away thanks the efforts of healthcare workers and those who helped develop and distribute the vaccine, I expect that our society will be left reflecting on our experiences during the pandemic and what we learned from it. So here is my reflection on my thoughts and experiences during the pandemic.

My mental state was already full of nihilistic existential angst and despair about the sheer scale of the suffering inherent in the human condition just before the COVID-19 pandemic started ruining everything we hold dear, and I have already been doomscrolling about all those horrible problems that plagued the entire world long before all of this pathetic shit hit the fan. That's why I didn't feel surprised when this goddamned mother-raping pandemic began even when I was so shocked to the core about all those countless deaths of innocent people and the unspeakable suffering that comes with it. But even though I was relatively safe from the scourge of COVID-19 because of taking all those safety precautions and shit like wearing facemasks outside, I felt like I could only helplessly watch as unfathomable numbers of people senselessly fell victim to COVID-19 as it ravaged and devastated the world. That's like having to witness millions and millions of people suffer and die in the most senseless ways ever possible, even while just sitting in a place that is completely safe and gives you everything you want. It's so fucking traumatizing and disgusting that it is sure to turn even the optimistic and happy people in the world into angsty brooding cynical edgelords who will never ever find happiness in anything.

And that's not even counting all the horrific shit the humanity has had to put up with just by simply existing. Fucked up shit like climate change, crapsack living conditions that countless people are forced to live with, refugee crises, racism, discrimination and persecution that corrupts the very soul of society and humanity, sexism and misogyny that was so severe that they had to bring about the #MeToo movement, oppressive and totalitarian regimes that make their peoples' lives a living hell just because they are unlucky enough to even exist under their tyrannical rule, systemic horrors such as war crimes, crimes against humanity, mass murder, mass rape and genocides like the Holocaust that still repeat for who knows how many fucking times no matter how many times we solemnly promise ""never again"" because of our silence, ignorance and indifference to human life and dignity, leaving all of these countless victims to suffer in vain without any hope of rest or peace for all the trauma they were forced to suffer, with each individual victim condemned to the atrocious fate of being reduced to someone once full of life and humanity doomed to be one amongst the countless dehumanized masses of tortured souls senselessly degraded into something too insignificant to even matter anymore. All those endless injustices caused by humanity's inhumanity to itself that are the consequences of its madness and fucked up nature have driven me crazy to the point I doubt whether a race of inherently self-destructive beings like humanity is ever even worth saving. Sometimes I feel like that humanity has crossed the moral event horizon and therefore beyond any hope of redemption and thus has to be wiped out just to spare further possible generations of human beings the sheer despair and horror of being born into a world where they are doomed to experience the horrors of suffering, inflicting this suffering upon others just to  protect themselves from it, or extremely likely even both. Since all of this sounds so antinatalistic that it goes against my fundamental beliefs that life is inherently valuable, I honestly wish that I didn't ever have to say anything like this at all.

One of most disturbing facts about the world that I loathe to such an incomprehensible extreme is the fact that no one can ever truly relate to, understand, or even fathom the lived experiences of people who have been victims of all of those horrific tragedies that befall countless millions of innocent people unlucky enough to be doomed to such hellish fates. And I was one of the lucky few people who got off relatively easy in life without personally having gone though all of this shit that makes absolutely no fucking sense at all. How can I even believe that I can't even come close to understanding the feelings and experiences of people how had no choice but to face all of this hopelessness and despair, all of these senseless and meaningless tragedies, and all of the sorrow and pain that plagues our very existence unless I commit some really horrifying act of self-harm that I desperately try extremely hard just to avoid doing?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!! Say all the shit you want about people complaining about COVID-19 when they don't have to live through even worse pandemics like the 1918 influenza or the Black Death, but I'm not going give even the smallest fuck about how grateful I am or how grateful I should be not to have even lived in the worst times to be alive in history anymore! Because why should I even have to be this goddamn lucky like some gambling addict who went extremely rich overnight just to enjoy a decent life where I can live in peace and happiness?!!!!!!!!!!!!! No one should ever even need this kind of luck just to live decently! Seriously!

All of this atrocious bullshit has led to me feeling a sense of grimdark in the world that makes me question the very concept of existence. I sometimes even feel like going meta about real life, wishing to do meta things such as breaking the fourth wall just to rebel against all of this drama and nonsense about human existence that I am so sick and tired of witnessing. Even if I absolutely know that it will all be futile in worthless in the end, it is much better that just giving up and accepting all of those horrible things about real life. Because the chances of me accepting all of this horrific suffering that plagues the world and all of humanity as a part of life and the human condition are about as low as the probability that Guts would ever even consider forgiving Griffith for what he did to him, Casca, and the rest of his comrades during the Eclipse - absolutely nothing. This is why I desperately wish that I could just Thanos snap all of these fucked up things out of existence for all eternity. All of those heinous things that really fucking suck, such as trauma, abuse of any kind, such as physical, mental, emotional, and worst of all, sexual abuse, having to learn from the suffering of countless beings and other really bad things just to get by in life, racism, sexism, oppression, dehumanization, people being so dysfunctional that they end up turning against each other in the most disturbing and self-destructive ways possible, states of consciousness worse than even death, and everything else so seriously fucked up about human nature and the human experience. All of them wiped out and erased from space and time, from all possible realities, to absolute and total oblivion without even the slightest trace. All of them retconned out of existence, completely and utterly obliterated and totally gone. Forever and for all eternity.

Believing in hope feels like getting high on an addictive drug that makes people really happy before they end up getting so fucked up and gaslighting yourself into feeling like the world's okay regardless of how insane the state of the world actually is. That's why I've gone cold turkey with hope regardless of what consequences I have to bear for the rest of my life. But still, I so desperately want to believe in hope and the goodness of human nature and appreciate all the cool things about existence without ending up having to do something so fucked up just to keep myself sane enough to enjoy real life, that I wish that real life wasn't full of all of this fridge horror.

So there you have it. My reflection on my experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wubba lubba dub dub."
Please tell me exercise is more effective than SSRIs. I can’t handle the side effects and I need something sustainable long term,9,mjzapz,14,I never took diet or exercise seriously most of my life. Probably because I was stressed out of my mind from social anxiety
"Tired of depression, don't know what I should do next",2,mk8h0m,0,"I feel like I've been working my way towards deciding if life is worth living or not, and I'm getting closer and closer to answering that question in the negative. 

I'm almost 30 years old. I have no friends and have really never had friends. I had one really good summer a couple of years ago, but life just gets in the way. I am busy with work, or covid, or taking care of elderly dying family members. Now I'm just scared to try, but I am lonely. 

I'm really ugly too, and I feel I will never have a relationship. I'm still a virgin. Girls really liked me in my teens, but I was too hesitant to take things further. Then I got really ugly in my mid-twenties. My teeth started to get really crooked. I'm balding and it doesn't suit me. I got fat, up to 240ish (I'm 6'), then lost down to about 190, but I'm still chubby with slight gynecomastia. I hoped I would be attractive again like when I was 18, but I'm not. My neck is weirdly fat and my jaw seems to have changed so I have an underbite. My ears were always asymmetrical but the baldness makes them stand out. I even get shit tested/made fun of by some guys at work. I can tell people are treating me differently because of the way I look. I don't think a romantic relationship could happen at this point. 

I went back to school and did really well to get a STEM degree. I am just graduating now, and I think I was treated differently during some job interviews because of the way I look. Nothing really bad, but you are just kinda invisible. People don't care about you, and then someone else gets the job. But now I have worked a couple of jobs, and I have an engineering degree, and I'm employed, and I just don't care. I don't like it. I don't think I will ever like working. My job is difficult and stressful and I want to leave even though I just started. I feel all I do is work and feel lonely. I go hiking, biking, and traveling, and I have hobbies, but I do it all alone. 

I went to therapy from last December through March because I was crying every day and I wanted to kill myself. I stopped therapy because the therapist wasn't that great. 

This isn't just a mood. This is a decade-long decline. Things are only going to get worse and I get older and uglier and my body gets sore. I already suffer from knee, back, jaw, and shoulder pain. I don't sleep well due to anxiety. Life just isn't fun. I don't think it's really worth it. 

But I'm all for any advice. I'm thinking about therapy again, but I dunno. All the therapists around here seem weird and a lot are into woo stuff that I don't really buy into. I feel I can't be helped, and I don't know how to help myself. 

I don't have dysphoria. Things really are bad. I am unattractive, and I will be alone. I feel if I could accept this, my quality of life might improve, but the limitations of my life are brutal, and I don't know where to start."
Money,2,mk848q,4,"Please tell me why everyone is so obssessed with money. It brings nothing but emptiness. Everyone tells me to go do all these things, but from the stuff they say, you can tell it's just coming from someone who hasn't had exposure to a lot of money.

Money does not buy happiness. It makes me feel like absolute shit when people are like oh yeah man just imagine a mansion, lambo... 

Maybe it's just me, I don't know. I want to fucking die. Coming from a millionaire - hate to even fucking say that, but hopefully it brings some validity to my point."

i hate babys,0,mkbkzg,3," having children is not synonymous with being an adult, it is synonymous with being trapped in an increasingly boring life with a boring person and a sample of human who will probably throw up in your face and you will find it cute because it was the most interesting thing that happened your life"
Why me.,11,mjxm1l,2,"It was about 10 or so years ago that I first felt something was wrong with me. Very long story short, I now sit here, at my lowest, wondering; why me? 

I have seen a dozen or so therapists / psychiatrists over the years, and the majority consensus is; I am fucked up. Big time. I meet the diagnostic criteria for 6, arguably 7 mental illnesses; major depressive disorder, borderline personality disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, body dysmorphia disorder, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse disorder, and high functioning autism-spectrum disorder or Aspergers. 

Life has been a constant battle for me in every facet. And it has only ever gotten worse. I can say that extremely objectively. I have never been lower. My problems have only ever grown like cancers in my mind. I cannot name a single issue within my life that has not grown larger and harder to cope with. I only accumulate more and more problems as I live.

Why me? For all my many, many faults, I’m not a bad person. I’m not an angel, but I’m really not bad. I try so hard to be what I think a good person should be. I feel like I expend all my energy every day just trying to survive. There’s nothing left really to put into massive life changes to improve myself. I feel like I need saving but no one is coming. 

Why me? I don’t deserve this. I honestly don’t. I hate myself but I don’t deserve *this*."
I think about suicide every day but I don't plan on acting on it. Should I tell someone?,16,mjv420,11,"I've never considered suicide as a serious option because my family is fucked up enough as it is and I'm too scared of death, but I still think about it everyday. How I would do it, if I should wait until my parents die, I can't even look at my window without thinking of jumping.

I know suicidal thoughts are serious, but, are they worth discussing if there is not a real risk of death involved? I haven't even told my therapist."
My 8 Year Struggle With Depression,4,mk3ab9,2,"I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder since I was 14; it's been 8 years, I'm 22 now, still on 100 mg Zoloft, still experiencing depressive episodes that are heightened by my OCD and generalized anxiety disorder.

I'm **so tired** of dealing with this shit.

Even when everything in my life is normal, or even happy, I have to find something to worry or fear over, or even just anything to be upset over. It's like the moment I feel happy, my brain reminds me I'm not allowed to indulge in such an emotion. I often get suicidal and self-harm ideations. They were gone for awhile but have started back up this last year. The worst is that I can never decipher whether it's me really, fully wanting to off or hurt myself, or if it's just my OCD making those obsessive thoughts up. I still have never self-harmed, but I want to.

I feel numb everyday. I really do feel like I offer very little to this world, and that I am only staying out of love for those in my life. And even though I have a semi-decent support system, I still constantly feel like no one cares about or for me. That everyone strongly detests me, finds me irritable, a nuisance. I always feel lesser, and also as if I am a back-burner or last-option friend with those I'm close with. Even my boyfriend who treats me very well has me feeling like a nuisance or necessity half the time, because I feel that if I message anyone looking for help or even just to spend time with them that I'm annoying the fuck out of them. And when I feel like that, I also sometimes get major PTSD flashbacks from my childhood abuse and past abusive relationship. Then I end up acting cold and distant towards those I love, and I beat myself up for it, finding the way I treat them when I feel this false sense of ""isolation"" to be sort of manipulative when I don't mean to.

I dont even know why I made this post. I guess just to rant. I hate admitting to myself I feel this way. I don't like to recognize the fact that I have suicidal thoughts, and that most often I am tired of living. I like to portray myself as goofy, energetic, happy-go-lucky, funny to everyone around me. But usually inside I am extremely burnt out and numb, basically like a phone with 10% battery. The most joy I've received from life thus far has been video games, television and cats. I barely leave my room, unless for work."
Just the ramblings of a lonely dude,1,mkbbfl,1,"Ok let's start from the beginning I am currently a 20 year old. I am average height and while I'm on the skinny side it's not too bad. I also make sure I am clean shaven and take showers all the time. I am in great shape there is a mountain by my house I hike up most nights. I feel like I just have to get that clear so people don't give me the wrong kind of advice.

Anyway so the farthest I've ever gotten with a girl was making out at a kickback back in like 2016. Now while I know that there is certainly more to life than relationships and I do have other hobbies like hiking and basketball at the end of the day there is only so much I can do during the day to try to prevent myself from feeling lonely and empty at the end of the day.

So this upcoming fall semester I am actually transferring out of my community college and into a real university. I got accepted to my local university but I decided to go to one that is about a 4 hour drive away from where I live now. I did this because I feel like there is nothing left for me in this city. Anyway the point is that I'll be living in college going to class compared to me living in my house doing online class. So in this new environment I'll have much more opportunities to meet girls compared to what I'm in now. I also plan to join a drama club since I do enjoy that to get myself out there as well. I do feel hopeful and I'm trying to stay positive but with this hope there is also a feeling of fear.

Firstly I fear that I just still won't have any luck with girls like it has been all my life. The main thing I fear is how girls will react to me telling them that. My plan is to not bring it up myself but if she asks I'd rather answer truthfully because I don't believe you should lie to your partner but what if she judges or thinks differently of me? Should I lie or tell the truth and would she find out when the times comes cause of me not knowing what the hell to do? People say some girls are turned on by taking a guy's virginity while other girls avoid us like the plague but I have yet to meet one of the first kind but plenty of the second. Anyway for me it doesn't matter how I lose my virginity whether that be because some girl is super drunk at a party and wants to smash me or to a girl I've formed a real connection with. I was pondering paying someone to take it for me but I convinced myself to wait until after college to do that. If it's a hookup I don't plan on saying anything before the act cause people hook up to have a good time not to coach someone. But if I actually do form a good relationship with a girl I would want to tell her beforehand but I'd still be afraid of judgement.

Last paragraph I swear. I almost feel like I'm at a crossroads in my life. There is the path where I not just get a girlfriend but make awesome friends and good connections. And then there is the path where I just can't do it for whatever kind of reason. Sometimes I see posts on here that say ""I'm 30 years old and still a virgin"" when I see those posts I just think to myself ""I would have killed myself before I even get to that point. If I'm being honest if I get to my late 20s/early 30s and I'm still a loner I'd rather just die at that point. I know that I'm still young so I don't plan on giving up yet anytime soon but I just hope I can get a girl sometime in the next few years.

Also if anyone especially the girls has any advice on how/when to tell a girl that I'm a virgin without it being awkward or bad how would I go about it? Should I say before or after the act or just not at all?

I'm not feeling well; 

I need some medicine; 

Can you drop some by?

I really need a hug (or a kiss or you to hold me)

I'm watching the big game tonight,

Momma, I'm waiting my turn

I'm not begging or whining

Just like you taught me,

But everything hurts,

And there's no respite in sight.

A stranger just saved my life...,5941,7k1nt2,171,"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live.

I was going to kill myself tonight,5153,bsrdr0,259,"I wrote a suicide note earlier in the morning. I spent most of the day doing things that used to make me happy: getting coffee, walking in the park, listening to music, etc. I ate my “last meal” while listening to Bob Marley.

About an hour before I was going to kill myself, my friend from college messaged me and asked to play Xbox. We ended up reminiscing on good times, and laughing our asses off. It felt nice to feel like somebody cared about me. We’re planning on playing tomorrow too.

I don’t feel as bad as I did earlier today and I also am glad that I didn’t kill myself.

"Does anyone ever feel okay for a while, then a wave of depression just hits you like a truck?",5051,b7fxrm,367,"Recently I thought I was beginning to feel better. Not quite happy, but just sort of... I don’t know, content? But my depression always seems to come back, sometimes stronger than others. This has happened in the past too. I’m worried that one day the gust of depression will blow too strongly and the branch i’m hanging onto will snap. Or maybe not. That could just be the apathy speaking though. Anybody else really frustrated by this? It feels like i’m always walking a razors edge between being fine, and being depressed and one misstep causes me to lose my balance. Ugh. 

Edit: evidently, there are quite a few people who experience similar feelings. I just want to say that it makes me happy in a sad sort of way to know that we are all going through something similar in our lives. It makes things less lonely."

Even if I'm feeling optimistic about my future and, ""what if everything really does work out the way I want it to?"" I feel like it's way too tiring to live the life I want and all I want is to sleep and do nothing.

Everyone says life is short but to me it seems so long and burdening and I don't want to do it.

High-functioning depression: I feel like I'm living a double life.,4074,dpl4bu,357,"I read a lot of posts on here of people struggling with daily, debilitating depression that plagues every aspect of their lives, making it difficult to do small things like even take a shower. I feel that I am on the opposite side of the spectrum and wanted to share that it is equally as horrible.

From an outsider's perspective, I appear to be a very happy and stable individual. I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay.

The Anhedonia associated with depression is the most dangerous symptom.,3885,i4483o,299,"Finding no enjoyment and gaining no reward from daily pleasurable activities Is no way to live.

You will never understand how unbearable it is until you have experienced it yourself. Is a life without joy, pleasure, and reward worth living? What if I never heal from this?

In her memory I'm going to tell the people I love how I feel, give my dog a hug, and remember that she is in my corner rooting for me when I feel like nobody else is.

One even said they don't understand how people can be depressed for seemingly no reason. Like I wish so much I could say the same.

Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed.

"I'm dying, all alone.",3504,m83mbr,283,"Hello Reddit. I'm a 54 M who has recently been diagnosed with a terminal disease. According to doctors I have a limited time untill cancer spreads everywhere in my body. That, however is not what I want to talk about.

I've had a hard life. I spent most of my childhood all alone, with no friends, always desperate for tiniest bit of affection. My parents were both too busy with their jobs to show affection to me. While I'm deeply grateful for all the things they did for me and various ways they shown how much they care about me, back in that time I didn't understand any of that. All I could see was how other parents hug and play with their kids but my parents didn't. I did a huge deal of stupid stuff in my childhood to get their attention. So many stupid and embarrassing things that I don't remember anymore since I really don't want to. Overall I hated my childhood.

I've never had any problems with my gender and behaved manly because I was comfortable with it. However since a long time before I stepped into my teen years, I knew I was maybe a little bit different. I hated sports, instead I really loved reading books, there were some other examples but like I said, I don't remember much about my childhood. I also didn't think they were a big deal. When I became a teenager I discovered that unlike any other teenage boys I knew, I was weirdly not interested in girls for some reason. I thought that I'll probably get there in time. I didn't. Now, I was different, in a very conservative and judging society. A society which even divorced people get looked at with anger. When I realized that instead of getting attracted to girls, I like boys, I panicked! I was only 14, I knew very little, I thought I'll get out of this mess as I grow older. In that period of time, I thought I was the only one like that. I was DIFFERENT. for the rest of my teenage life I ignored that, hoping for a change in my preference in the future.

When I grew older I became aware of what situation I was in. I was, ... gay. Even to this day I can't say that word without my voice shaking. I tried everything to change, it did not work. Many many questions were raised in my head. Like ""Why am I like this?"", ""How am I going to live like this?"" I encountered a huge moral, religious, and cultural dilemma. It was horrible. Untill this day I've got no answers. It was simply so much for me to process.  This quickly affected me and became a major source of depression, anxiety, social insecurities and etc. I gained a lot of weight as a result and went through a very depressing path. Due to all the stress and anxiety I encountered achromotrichia and my hairs started becoming white at early ages. Then I went through a severe phase when I was 18 in which I tried confronting myself. I tried my best to accept who I am. I didn't want to change, just wanted to come clean and admit it. It was not successful. I fell down a hole of worse distancing and anxiety, from 2 of my friends whom I came out to, one refused to believe what I am and one cut ties with me. My best friend, even though he could not believe it, was actually supportive, but soon he moved far away in a different state. I had no one to talk to. My family didn't know what was wrong with me and everything they did to help me only made it worse. I couldn't stand how sad my parents would get if I told them what I was. After all they did for me I couldn't bring tears to my mom's eyes and sadness to my dad. I spent about a month just waking up, eating, and staring at my room with no purpose. I finally had it decided. After 32 days I started planning my suicide.

Everything was set on that day. I already did everything and I went to bed early that night so that I'd be ready for the big day. As I was tying the rope around my neck, I heard my little sister's laughter. I burst into tears. Once again I was being selfish. How could I make her little heart sad? How cruel can someone be to hurt a little girl like that? I stopped. I knew this would happen again if I don't make any changes. So I did. I promised my self never to think of that issue again. I suppressed my sexual desires. I kept myself busy with other stuff so that I wouldn't get distracted. I was once again able to wake up without immediately remembering what I was. I could live my pathetic life again.

When I was aware of my condition, I made myself a promise. That I wouldn't emotionally hurt anyone and that I don't do anything about my sex life. Fun fact, I'm still a virgin til this day. Despite my family's pressure, I didn't get married. How could I force myself to like a women and ruin her life. Why would I start a family which I can't love the way I should. Why would I ruin someone else's life because of my selfishness. I didn't date or confess to anyone either. As far as I knew, I couldn't live with the emotional weight of  accepting who I am. How could I enter a relationship and transfer all my insecurities to another person? The night that I made myself that promise I very well knew this means I will die all alone. With no one to hold me, hug me, or kiss me. Funny how I still crave human contact though I didn't have any even when I was a kid. 

Rest of my life was boring. I lived. I had a good job with good payment. That's it. I never felt happy. I had some fallbacks but mostly tried eliminating my feelings. I never told anyone what I was again. I lived as the creepy alone man who lives next door. And now I have cancer. With a much more limited time than ever. I'm actually kinda happy, it'll all end soon. I only wish I could be happier, without all these regrets. I would've wished a world in which gay people were not looked at differently but I can't imagine how would that go. I'd also wish for me to be straight but I honestly have no idea how that works. Not once I was interested in women to have a sense of that. I even tried looking at pictures of  ""HOT WOMEN"" ( it's hilarious I know. ) for a long time in my young years to see if anything happens but it didn't. 

So, at the end, I'm soon dying, never kissed the person I loved, or even met the person I loved, full of depression and sadness and 54 years of loneliness. I don't exactly know who will read this, I never got noticed in my life I don't see why I should be noticed now. I also don't know how much time I have left.

But I’m also sick of constantly feeling like I’m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can’t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don’t know. Anyone else feel the same?
"The worst part of the depression, is that feeling, deep deep down, that the reason you're depressed is because you want to be.",3456,jikvg7,219,"It's just the thought, that maybe you know how to be happy. Maybe all the stuff you read online, the stuff your family tells you, the stuff you hear from your therapist, maybe it all goes somewhere in your head. Maybe you've seen enough happy, normal functioning people, that you have some idea of how to do what they do. That maybe you've made the same mistakes enough times that you could point them out and stop repeating them.

It's the idea that, you know how not to be depressed, so if you still are, then that means you must want it this way. And if you want it this way, well that must mean you deserve it.

And I guess, that's probably not true, but sometimes, sometimes I just don't know."
Becoming a regular at a local coffee shop changed my life,3444,b7q1kc,166,"I was depressed, failing school, etc and I decided I should do my homework at a coffee shop one day. I went in and the owner was super nice and asked me if I wanted to join the rewards program and I was really craving community at this point and I was super excited. 
I kept coming back to the shop to do my homework and the owner and the baristas would always welcome me and they were always happy to see me. I started to get to know everybody there very well and now I consider them all friends. 
I found that when depressed having different communities helps a lot, and it turns out a lot of the other regulars at coffee shops also are depressed or have other mental illnesses. 
A two dollar drink can let you stay there for a few hours and by being nice to everyone around you and being somewhat productive on work it can be a really great place to have"
"I don't want to die but if I was offered a chance to erase myself from existence, I would take it",3404,ia2nf9,158,"Apologies in advance for the ramble that follows and for any mistakes as this isn't my native language.

No matter how busy I make myself, it all seems pointless in the end. What the fuck am I working towards ? Doesn't seem like I have any purpose in life even though I'm 26 and most people my age are making their careers and starting to settle down.

Anything I do is to distract myself from my thoughts but I end up at the same dark place at the end of every day. Honestly feel like instead of growing as a person, I deteriorated in the last few years.

I have no motivation left except that I love my parents and them having to witness my death will destroy them. If only there was a way to erase myself from everyone's memories."

"Do you ever think, “Fuck, I just wanna go home,” but you’re already inside your “home”?",3334,j45vaw,133,"A house (or apartment) is surely different from a home, and it seems I haven’t had a home for many, many years now despite always having a place to stay.

Anhedonia is the worst part of depression,3335,k47q9a,300,"You're alive, but you aren't living. You feel like doing something, anything, but nothing is appealing. Everything feels like a chore, and it's exhausting. ""Do things that you enjoy doing"" doesn't work, since everything feels like watching paint dry. Realising that you're slowly beginning to lose interest in the few things you enjoy doing and realising that there's nothing you can do about it is mentally torturing. It's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands; it's hopeless. The only thing you look forwards to is death."

Does anyone else stay up to 3AM every night wanting to die only to get up for school and start the cycle over again every day?,3275,dsgdf3,255,I'm so tired and I hate everything.
I hate 'foggy brain syndrome',3278,lgdpee,302,"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory. Now, it's like I'm on permanent autopilot. I rarely ever take note of my surroundings or have clear inner monologue. I'm always stuck in this half-awake state where I can't focus on multiple things at once and just kind of ""zone out"" so to speak. I also tend to forget things really quickly for some reason.

It makes me feel like some useless, brain-dead retard that can't even function normally or think basic thoughts. It's as if my cranium is rotting away or something. I'm stuck with permanent brain fog and there's nothing I can do about it. I take antidepressants and vitamin d pills, I drink lots of water, I eat healthy, but nothing works. 

I hate the fact that my brain will never work the same way again, all because of depression. It's destroying my life and I can't take it anymore.

Edit: In case anyone is curious, I don't do drugs or drink alcohol, nor am I old. I'm just a depressed 22 year old dude."
"I wish I could say ""I was depressed"" the same way I say ""I was sick"" to explain my absence",3275,e00pxq,131,"I'm so tired of making excuses. I am sick, just in my head."
"Life doesn't ""get better"" unless you take actions to MAKE it better. But depression itself can make it impossible to act",3251,i2h6dv,211,"Exercise/physical activity, eating healthy, spending time in nature, finding a hobby are all things that are supposed to ""be good for your mental health""... but by definition, depression is a problem *precisely because* it inhibits your inability to function, much less do things that are good for you. Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday.",3206,cqqe91,173,"I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester. 

Also to all the people who said this post gave them a little kick in the ass to go back, were all going to do amazing :)"
Being suicidal is like being at a terrible party,3167,jizxdt,90,"Being suicidal is like being on a really terrible night out. I'm having a terrible time but my friends and family are all enjoying it so I stick around. They're the ones that invited me and said I'd have a good time. But as time goes on, the desire to leave just gets stronger and stronger so I try to distract myself by getting some more drinks to make it a bit more bearable but I still really just want to leave. But everyone is telling me that this is a great night out to be on and that I should just stay and try to enjoy myself. But I'm not enjoying myself. I'm just numbing my annoyance at not being allowed to leave with drugs and alcohol. I've got to the exit door a couple of times but I couldn't get any further than that. What's more annoying is that while I can get help to make the night out more manageable, I'm not allowed to just leave. I'm stuck here. It feels like this night out has just turned into a prison sentence."

""You'd be disappointing your family, etc"" - Ah yes, by trapping me in the hypothetical mental state of permanently worrying about others over myself, I now get to live a happy and successful life, thank you.

Why does no one ever speak about the major memory loss that comes with depression?,3021,hasw9k,447,"(I haven't been on this sub before so idk if it's discussed here more often or if it even happens to everyone but I have basically never heard of people talk about this aspect of depression) Seriously, before I had depression I didn't have the slightest idea that it would effect your memory and every time I mention my fucked up memory people are always suprised. I can't think of any good reason why this is compleatly ignored when people discuss about this because it has had a huge effect on my life. I can't explain how awful it is when someone talks about stuff i've said or done and I can't properly remember it myself.

Edit: everyone probably doesn't have this and it's not an offical symptom of depression but it definitely is a side effect. Like some people have said it all just blurs together. I think it has something to do with how you don't really enjoy the stuff you do so you just go on and do things without thinking or registering them. I mean I can't remember most of my childhood or early teenage years so don't know what's that all about but it's kind of a relief that im not alone with this.

Edit: it took me about 30 minutes (if not more) to read all of these comments. I didn't really read everyone all the way through or focuse on them but I tried to read them all. Still thanks everyone and im glad this helped some people."
Depression is one of the few diseases that can end your life without killing you,3020,i7ialo,142,"Like, I’m still alive, but I can’t experience my life anymore. I’m basically a walking dead zombie."
The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality,3015,b8tms8,164,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling. I wish you all luck in getting better."
Life feels like staring at the fridge when nothing looks good to eat,3001,iyjuob,146,"You know the feeling - you're hungry and open the friedge but everything in there looks disgusting. So you either give up and don't eat or force down something that is completely unsatisfying. That is every part of my life right now.

I don't know how else to explain it. I have energy now (with my meds) and an urge to be doing something, but nothing seems appealing. 

When I do things, I don't feel good about it or pleasure. But if I sit around doing nothing, I feel the urge to be doing something.

I don't know what to do or how to explain it.

EDIT: Holy crap. Thank you everyone for the likes and awards and comments. It makes me feel connected and a little less alone. I will try to reply to all the comments."

Ive decided to get admitted to a hospital instead of just killing myself,2994,is8ldk,121,"Hi, im obviously depressed and have almost killed myself countless times. Ive been living in a hotel for 2 weeks planning to kill myself here, away from anyone i know. The thing that stops me is the thought of hurting my friends. I went to a hospital for help once but the environment/doctors just made me feel even more depressed and trapped. I have been really scared to go to the hospital since last time it just put me in a worse place. Now i know that i have to go because otherwise im certain ill just kill myself. Im writing this so that my decision can become relatively real and so i am more likely to hold myself to it.

Depression = Losing intelligence,2987,ifxaf7,201,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

Imagine if the cure to a broken leg was to run a marathon with it. That's what getting help for depression looks like to me.,2970,7hz0m4,170,"I'm discouraged today! :D

I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day ❤️"
I think that the worst part of depression is that every day you just wait for the day to end cause that's all you have,2961,lmrsbh,133,"The point I realised that I think I collapsed in some way. That I only live from one day to another. That maybe my suicidal tendencies are just wanting to stop that cycle which slowly rots my mind.

I feel like Im just a pile of dust on the edge of the table, waiting for someone to clean the table and stop my existance for good.

Idk if any of it makes any sense. If anything in life actually makes sense."
I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,2946,jz3rhk,96,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so."
"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".",2951,buq56r,124,"But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was. 

*Edited to add: Thank you all for the kind words and awards. I really didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did. I wrote this in an attempt to put my experience with depression into words, and to serve as a reminder of what it feels like, for the times when normal people try to tell me my depression isn't real or otherwise downplay it.*"

"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.",2907,gx4ic5,336,"Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

Edit 2: wow, I was not expecting this kind of response from so many people. I'm trying to respond to everyone, but I think I can't. I'd like to thank you all once more for all your words. I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all"
it’s so weird how parents swear they know you better than you know yourself but can’t see when you’re not happy,2878,hg7t7e,79,It’s been so bad lately. My sleep schedule is completely fucked. The lower left corner of my bed is full of trash and I can’t toss and turn in my bed without feeling a crumb. I don’t leave my room unless it’s to get food or see my mom because she works from home all day. I haven’t changed clothes in a week. At least I’m showering and brushing my teeth and stuff. That’s become a habit ever since I got two cavities from not doing so in a month. It’s like I don’t want to talk about it because I hate talking about it. I just want to go to the doctor get a therapist or some shit and never talk to my family about anything like it. Because I’ve still got doubts whether I have depression or I’m just lazy and a shitty person.
Staying alive just so you won't make anyone sad seems exhausting.,2860,jmunx3,170,"I always say that. 'I'd never kill myself because i wouldn't want to make my family sad.' But what if I'm 50 and still feeling this way? Suffering through decades feeling like shit, just so i won't make anyone sad seems so f.ckin exhausting. I'm sorry if I'm seeming selfish."
Does anyone else find it increasingly hard to pretend to be a normal functioning human being?,2818,fgnp3a,195,"My only social interaction is at work but it's getting harder to pretend I'm a normal functioning human being. Haha sports, family, friends, hobbies, ambition, future, yeah I totally love them haha I am a normal human being that has things that normal beings enjoy too haha I am normal too haha"
It’s not that I want to kill myself. But if I die I wouldn’t be upset.,2819,cwl19g,198,"I don’t think i could ever kill myself but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to die. It’d just be so much easier than disappointing everyone I love if something just happened to me and I died. I know it isn’t right to think like this but I can’t stop.


Edit: this blew up, it’s kinda bittersweet knowing so many others feel the same.

Edit 2: thank you all so much for the words of encouragement. I’m home now and would love to reply to all of them but I have to do homework. Things will get better for all of us if there’s this much support in the world."
"Has anyone else went to see a therapist to get help from their severe depression, but once you get there your mind is so hazy and forgetful that it makes it extremely difficult to explain your experience?",2817,ckmvf8,349,"I found that a lot of times in the past I would be rushed out the office with crappy advice that I was already “trying” to do and then I panic and try to desperately get everything out by the end of the session. It’s hard to open up about it when I’m having an episode because the symptoms of pure confusion, difficulty thinking and focusing, MEMORY LOSS and just plain blankness of mind makes everything so frustrating... 



*For not from depression, sorry"
I almost killed myself today,2807,bnbp7c,185,"I just broke down. That just overwhelming feeling of worthlessness and self hate just maxed out. I sat in my dark living room sobbing and trying to decide if I should write anything. Before I could do anything my cat came and jumped on me. He pressed his face to mine and I just snapped back. I’m trying so hard to get better. I’m glad my cat jumped on me. That sweet little guy saved me.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I didn’t expect to receive so much kindness. For those wondering, I am currently seeing a therapist and psychiatrist for mental health and medication management.

To the few people who said hurtful things. My story may be “cliche and boring” but it’s still my fucking life. It’s my experience, I can’t change it to make it more exciting or interesting for you. It wouldn’t be real then. To those who told me to try again and that I’m a failure. You don’t have to tell me that. I know but I’ve never been more happy to fail at something in my life."
"When I’m sitting on my ass doing nothing, I feel useless and depressed. When I’m actually doing something, i think about how I’d rather be just relaxing at home",2806,bc3svr,76,"Just a loop of unhappiness, really hope I can fix it soon.  I wanna know what the fuck happened to my motivation and care for life."
I feel like I’m addicted to depression.,2792,f1djgl,209,Whenever I feel sad I don’t try to cheer up I try to make myself sadder because I like it more. I feel addicted to isolating myself from others and there’s a small part of me that enjoys feeling depressed and isolated. Depression feels strangely comforting at times. Does anyone else have this issue?
"the worst thing about depression,is seeing everyone around you progress in their life and you are stuck in the same place",2781,f5zfvl,208,"its like when you are playing videogame and you get stuck on some part of mission,while others are having fun,you are having the worst time in ur entire life"
"Do you ever feel that the deeper in depression you are, the dumber you become?",2779,blt0wy,207,Today I was feeling extremely low. I don't know but my I feel like my ability to process information and write has been decreased. I'm just so angry and irritable. I hate this feeling
"My automatic psychological response to any kind of stressful situation is “just kill yourself”, and I hate it.",2769,hushhf,160,"Like literally, anything. It can be the most minor thing and it’s either that or the niggling urge to do harm to myself.

Like.. I am fine. I have actually been fine for ages... I’m no longer depressed in my eyes, but it is still that automatic response. Then it makes me question if I am fine after all? Probably not.

ETA: Well, I certainly did not expect so many people to relate to this. Whilst it is a comfort in that it seems somewhat “normal”, it does make me a little bit sad to see so many people experience this. Take care everyone x"

"A Depressed persons vocabulary ""I'm fine"" ""Im okay"" ""nah I'm just tired"" ""it's not a big deal"".",2746,bam1f4,253,what do you guys say when someone gets mad at you for being sad? or when your being moody because your sad?
"I don't wanna kill myself, I just don't wanna wake up anymore.",2724,hbvhbr,209,"Idk if that makes sense. But I don't want to kill myself, I really don't. I want to be killed. I want to be shot or to not wake up. I don't want to make the choice to kill myself because my friends and family will feel responsible but I want to die."
I feel like depression took away the person I could have been.,2715,lm5kic,147,"I'm currently not doing too terribly, actually, but I've had recurring depression for most of my life.

I'm trying to job hunt right now but I keep reading things about ""skills"" and ""interests"" and thinking - yeah, those would be nice things to have. I don't feel like I've had real interests since I was a kid. I basically haven't ever had adult friends, either. I just kind of float through life. 

I just wonder who I would be if I hadn't spent so much of my life as the emotional equivalent of a potato, if I didn't keep living knowing that even with treatment that that inert, non-person version of myself is going to keep coming back and all I can do is manage it."
"I'm not lazy, I'm mentally drained",2707,k9rfuf,168,"I hate how people who I thought knew better tell me that I'm lazy, I'm not. I wanna get up and be excited to do stuff but I'm just not. I'm tired all the time and everything doesn't seem to excite me anymore."
"When I don’t have a job, I want a job. When I have a job, I don’t want a job. When it’s hot, I want it to be cold. When it’s Fucking cold, I want it to be hot.

I always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then I get them and I want the opposite. Complete self destruction and all 
It sucks how mental health is never a valid excuse in college,2689,ipgaqf,120,"*CW*

An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities,2679,dx2la6,217,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months. I can barely even talk to people in my classes now, they seem so competent and on top of things while I'm just an embarrassment who can barely form a coherent sentence."
"Too depressed to be productive, and not depressed enough to kill myself",2675,bzc9jt,195,I lowkey wish I can be pushed over the edge so I'll have the courage to end it all (as horrible as that sounds)

"I feel like I'm getting stupider, less talented, clumsier, and that soon I will be completely retarded.",2644,80diyr,257,"As the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything. I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.

Anyone else feel like that?"
Nostalgia Is Not As Pleasant When You're Depressed,2626,m4yndv,139,"For most people nostalgia is generally accepted as being a nice feeling, a pleasant memory. But for me it just reminds of a more innocent, happier time when I was child. I thought my future was good and all I cared about was playing with friends and climbing trees. How things have changed

Edit: I genuinely didn't expect so many kind comments even on a sub like this. I feel better and I have you all to thank for that."
Anyone like being in the shower not for the purpose to get clean but standing in the water while the hot water just runs through your body while you just stare,2623,a1891a,209,It makes me feel less alone and its like im safe from everything in there and a sense of dread takes over me when im finished and i have to get out and face the world again Weird post lol sorry

I just lay in bed all day and cry, and the only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because of my cat- who can’t even live with me anymore because of my landlord. So I send my dad money to feed him.
Everything is shit. I never brushed my teeth consistently for years and now it’s fucking me. I’m so ashamed my face is disgusting. My face I don’t have the energy to wash and my teeth are getting yellow because I never have the energy to brush

Edit 2: This has me all kinds of emotional. I’ve never had so much faith in the kindness of strangers."
Fun fact: when I was younger many people told me I was a gifted child of above average intelligence.,2588,bycijd,286,"WELL I SURE SHOWED THEM, DIDN'T I?

I'm a massive fuckup. I forget things the minute after I am told them. There's just a massive pile of fuzzy static in my head. My grammar has devolved into caveman-speak.

I dunno if I blame my mental health or if I'm just stupid."
I fantasize about a social life in my head,2581,iw8cv4,136,"I have full conversations with friends I don't have, about stories I haven't lived. I imagine how they'd respond and laugh at my jokes.

I don't have any real friends, I spend my life alone because I have no real confidence in myself. I feel my youth wasting away and I hate who I am. I am unemployed so I couldn't have moved out from home.

I imagine myself as a successful athlete (I know it's stupid) and I imagine how I'd interact with people and the questions they'd ask.

It's disappointing to come back to my real life and realize what I am. I've done nothing with my life for the past 8 years. And nothing is moving forward. I compare myself to other men my age, and I am a failure in every aspect. I am no better today than I was 5 years ago.

I wish I could escape into my fantasies"
Fuck u if u discriminate against people with trauma and mental illness,2574,gttjis,133,"You know how many people reject me and judge me for my mental illness/trauma? Guys will fucking play me, act all into me at first, and then flip the script and be like “oh srry this ain’t gonna work out, u don’t rlly love me ur just miserable haha bye” (they don’t say that literally but im trying to summarize lol) LIKE WTF?! You knew about my trauma and mental illness from day one! Why even entertain the idea of wanting me if you were just gonna reject me for things outside of my control anyways! Do you know how devastating and invalidating that is? That’s like saying someone with a disability can’t love someone because they’re not “normal”. Tbh I think the only reason guys do this is because they see girls like me as easy targets. Since I’m mental and I’ve been abused my entire life they think they can just walk all over me, and are surprised when I stand up for myself and don’t allow them to do that. Well, screw you and fuck off🖕🏽"
Anyone else barely hanging on to life with no motivation whatsoever?,2568,dlfw2v,305,"Too much of a coward to kill myself, but at the same time have no reason to live. I just need to know that I’m not alone who feels like this in this hour."
"Two years ago, I (30m) thought I’d have a family by now. Instead, I’m alone and have cancer.",2550,jwjfl0,144,"My ex (31f) ended our eight-year relationship soon after Christmas of 2018. We had intended to get married in May of 2019 and had plans to settle down and start a family. But she got cold feet, married someone else less then six months later, and is now pregnant.

Since then, I’ve gone on a few dates with people I’ve met on various dating apps, but haven’t had any success. Rejection never feels good, but the most recent rejection, which came after a few dates, hit me hard.

It’s opened up my eyes to the fact that I have pretty much nothing to offer. Besides being no better than average in any way, I have cancer, which isn’t exactly a selling point. I don’t know whether it’s terminal, and neither do my doctors. I’m seeing my oncologist in two weeks, and to be honest, I’m hoping for bad news. 

I’ve been dealing with depression since I was a teenager. For the duration of my previous relationship, it wasn’t much of an issue. Since then, it’s gotten considerably worse."
"Anybody feel like you died long ago, and you're just a zombified shell?",2552,d39ghz,225,"I just go through the routine every day, and kinda let everything just pass by. I don't really have much of an emotional response to anything, and my personality feels like a mush of stuff.

Is anyone else hating the fact that they’re wasting time of their life as you’re witnessing it all go in the drain because of their stupid mental illness holding you down?,2546,c79mb0,182,"It’s so stressful. There’s so many things I want to do but I just can’t at the moment and it sucks. Theoretically, I could be physically paralyzed for months and it would be just the same as if I wasn’t paralyzed and living my regular depressed life. Watching your life go by without any motives and meaning as you have no one there beside you because you’ve kicked everyone out of your life is one of the worst feelings for me."
Do you ever get so empty you’re excited when you finally start crying because at least you’re feeling an emotion?,2545,bktcxk,111,I’ve felt empty for days and just now cried a little. Even though I’m miserable I was almost happy. It’s worse to feel like you’re dead than being sad.

Being depressed and having depression are different.,2521,ie47wl,166,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life. 


Anyway, that’s all. I’m sure no one will even read this. K bye

Edit: I’m really happy this post caused some awesome conversations hopefully made people feel less alone in the fact that you can be depressed about nothing. 🥰"

Anger as a symptom of depression need to be recognized more,2496,lxjale,123,"Depression isn’t just being depressed all the time. Anger and feeling numb is also a big part of it. Before I was diagnosed, I was a lot to handle. I would get angry for no reason and destroyed my things as an ineffective coping mechanism. I even went as far as assaulting my mom once but luckily, I have a mother who was nice enough to not press charges and encouraged me to go into therapy. I now know better ways to handle my anger. Of course most angry people arent depressed (some people are just miserable) but depressed people are often angry.

But I’m a single child, my parents are single children, all my grandparents are dead - it’s just us three. They’re getting old, too. I couldn’t just *not* go. They would have been so sad and I don’t want that.

"The reality of depression: Yesterday I was googling ""most effective suicide methods"". Today I feel fine.",2462,ck913s,225,"This has probably happened hundreds of times in my lifetime. I'm 50 now, so obviously I haven't succumbed to depression yet. But the peaks and valleys are insane; I guess *I'm* insane. Yesterday it fully made sense to me - if I had had immediate means to end my life I could see taking that action. This is why I can never have a gun, or live in a tall building.  
So far that small voice in me that says ""It will get better, just wait"" has remained more powerful than the other larger, louder voice that says ""You've always been alone. You'll always be alone. Life isn't worth the pain."" My reality is having both of those voices in my brain, and feeling that both are absolutely real when they're there."

"Do you ever doubt the validity of your depression? And just think that the reason you can’t do normal things, is just because you’re a bad person?",2459,bh71ld,172,"My depression has depression bro. A lot of the time I doubt that I have a mental illness, and blame myself for being incapable of doing normal things. I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing. But deep down I would give anything in the world to feel happiness. 
I hope this isn’t just me. Like deadass, I don’t know if I’m the only person who feels like this. And if I am that’s just gonna scare me."
My girlfriend cheated on me with one of my best friends while I was at the psych ward for trying to kill myself. Someone please cheer me up,2446,ek3uky,273,"So this happened about 5 months ago but I found out about it this morning right after she broke up with me.

Not suicidal but just no desire to live each day,2434,k3g4mz,220,"I don’t wanna end it all, but I’m just tired of living. Like each day kind of feels pointless. I feel exhausted just thinking about doing the same thing every day. I’m not happy and feel no purpose. It’s like I want it to be the next day, and the next day comes, and I’m wishing it was the next. I don’t know how to explain it. I’m just existing and not living.

Absolutely nothing interests me anymore. I fucking hate it.,2426,dxp0co,198,"I literally don’t want to do anything at all. It doesn’t bring me any happiness or joy or whatever. At best, just distracts me from feeling shitty. Absolutely nothing helps. Video games, writing, reading, doing photography, drawing... none of that makes me happy.

It’s the absolute fucking WORST. I don’t even feel like sleeping, but I don’t wanna be awake either. I go to bed before 7pm because I have nothing else I wanna do. All I do is lie in bed and listen to miserable songs and cry, then I go to sleep, wake up and repeat.

I hate living. I hate this existence. I wish I could just die in my sleep.

High functioning depression is so easily over looked,2429,g6jgq0,163,"I try and do anything and everything all day. I can't be alone with my thoughts so my objective is to do as much as I can to keep busy. Every evening I'm exhausted, emotionally drained and still depressed. I feel like I'm beating back a relentless force. I feel like I've been robbed of being proud of the little things I do like washing my face or baking because I do that anyway so it's not like I can be proud of the effort I've put in. My biggest fear is waking up and not having anything to do, just be in my head. Fortunately I'm able eat, brush my teeth and do things every day and to the outsider I look like I'm doing really well but I'm struggling a lot. Before this there was a year of staying in bed and not doing anything but now that I'm doing things everyday I feel even more hopeless. It's proof that even if I'm proactive in my life I feel as shit as I would if I did fuck all."
"Fuck this shit dude, how in the hell is anyone supposed to keep up with scjool, work, social life, healthy eating + exercise, and hobbies?",2432,b3pipn,188,"I'm so fucking done with this shit. I've had multiple exams this week all during my colleges green beer day fesitivies, which I've had to skip due to studying. Then I get asked why I'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why I haven't been going to the gym with them. Then my parents asking why I'm spending money at Chipotle and Wendy's and shit like I'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. Then I'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit I like to do. Fuck this. How is anyone supposed to do this? What the fuck is the point. Sorry for ranting. Fuck this week. Been shit. Anyone want to talk? I need a study break I wanna help some people, maybe do some good in this fucked world. Love all of you "
I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed,2427,gnmp5u,104,"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

tdlr; things were fine until they weren’t and I just don’t know what to do anymore"
Nobody gives a fucking shit about you until you mention killing yourself.,2417,brffm6,194,"This world and all the people living in it is such a heaping pile of horseshit. Nobody has a fuck to give about mental illness. It's blatantly obvious. Fuck this.

Edit: This post isn't about me, it's about other people."
I shouldn't have to lie about my depression to get a sick day,2414,cmcier,163,"But I do. Every time. Because saying ""I threw up everywhere last night"" gets you a ""Oh sweetie, take the day off to rest, it's okay!"", but saying ""My depression is acting up really badly and I just can't do it today"" gets you a ""Don't be lazy! Everyone gets sad, suck it up and come into work!"".

I shouldn't have to be fucking ashamed of my depression. It's as medical as the flu, yet people seem to think mental illnesses aren't a valid reason, and that you're not really sick.

Fuck that shit. We need to break the stigma towards mental illnesses in general."
I don't want to kill myself but I wish I was never born,2419,gvzogx,111,"Life is too much. Really. I could never killed myself bc I'm too much of a coward to indulge me any kind of harm, but those days I just don't know what to do.

I'm always waking with the urge to die, I cry myself to sleep, when I wake up I cry as well it just doesn't seem to stop.
I'm 20 and I feel that I'm stuck in a 16yo mentality. I'm in some studies that are really demanding and I'm just wasting time bc I'm too much of a failure to succeed anything.
My few friends are moving forward, are happy whereas I'm stuck and never been in a relationship.
I don't have any motivation, or goal my life seems dull and just not worth it.
I don't know if I have like i dunno any kind of pathology, should I go see a doctor or smth like that ? Or am I just moping on my pathetic life like a child ?"
Worst part about depression is that I feel like I have no personality anymore.,2417,jgb05g,131,"There are other worse stuff, but this is what comes to mind. Honestly feels like I’m bland af now and boring to other people. One of the reasons why I don’t even want to try anymore, because I don’t want to bore them."
Waking up is one of the worst feelings ever.,2407,hee2ak,123,"Because then you realize that nothing has changed since you slept and your life is still fucking awful.

Edit: I just want to say, that after briefly reading the comments, I'm sorry that many of you feel the same way as I do. There's not much I can say or do to help, but I truly am sorry and I hope that you all can find the time to finally get a good night's sleep and look forward to waking up."
Anyone else get lost in their daydreams and get hit with a wave of depression when you snap back to reality?,2403,dck8hr,128,I spend so much time thinking about how I wish my life was that I can’t face the actuality of where I am.
I feel like depression makes me more stupid,2408,gv1cqg,162,"Like it's harder for my brain to work.  Like I'm in the middle of a fog.  I make stupid mistakes at work.  I wonder if I'm mentally handicapped.  I have thoughts of, what if I'm no longer mentally able to do my job?  That scares me.

EDIT:  Finally got back here and wow, did this take off.  I went through every last one of your comments.  I'm in a brain fog even as I write this so I don't have the right words but thank you for all your stories, support, advice, information and so much more.

As much in pain as I am right now I am so grateful.  Because until now I was missing a huge understanding of my condition.  A doctor once told me I was ""living in a dark room.""  Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease.

So I hope you have had ""a-ha"" moments about your condition too.  So that we can all be on the way to recovery, like some have fortunately accomplished. "
I want to exist when everyone’s paused,2409,j7mwhi,121,Does anyone else agree their favourite time is when everyone is sleeping and your awake. It’s like your just existing and they’re paused. I wish it could be like that forever where u don’t have to explain anything. You can just exist.
"Everyone says you should talk about what's bothering you, but when you finally find the courage to say anything, the response is so bad that you promise yourself to never open up again",2406,l3i9ne,107,"Finally opened up a little to my teacher about how I was feeling and she told me I was childish and ""giving off helpless vibes""

It's alright, I guess I agree with her, I just wish she hadn't told the whole class that ""your feelings are valid and you have to talk about them"" etc etc, because she clearly doesn't care and I feel stupid now. 

Never again."
My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,2403,jqkwz0,87,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

Edit: I don't know what to say right now... Last time I looked at my phone this had 10 upvoted and I was so happy that 10 people considered this useful and now I see this... Thank you so much, this means the world to me."
Does anyone else experience anger as a part of depression?,2396,edpkii,238,I always feel angry or annoyed or nothing is going right and I've felt like this around the same time as my depression reared its ugly head. So many things piss me off. I sometimes even go into borderline misanthropy because of my depression induced anger. It's led me to have fights with people who are my family and friends and I don't know why I push them away
How many other people go to sleep wishing they'll die peacefully before they wake up?,2393,ecb4lx,171,"I read this a lot here, ""I don't want to kill myself, I just wish I didn't exist"". I identify with that...  so much. I just don't want to keep feeling like this anymore, and for whatever reason that thought is amplified as I'm trying to sleep (e.g. right now). All I want is to simply not wake up tomorrow. Is that so much to ask for?

Edit: wow, I did not expect to get so many responses when I wrote this yesterday. Although sad, it's still oddly comforting to know I'm not alone in feeling this way, so thank you sincerely for sharing. For those who offered helpful tidbits, thank you also. I hope that you all find peace one way or another, just as I hope that I can too. But let's face it, chances are that's won't be tonight, so.... here we go again."
i like being alone but i hate being alone,2393,i8vxh5,140,anyone else
I deleted my note!,2389,bz5d2z,143,"I had a long, very long suicide not stored in my phone, just waiting, and yesterday I deleted  it, i know it it’s not a huge step, but I feel ultimately better!

Update- I didn’t expect this to blow up, I posted it because I couldn’t believe I had finally done it; and I had felt so good, I’m trying to say thank you to everyone who commented, thank you to whoever gave me gold, you’re the best, and you all are amazing. Thank you!

Update 2- to everyone saying I inspired them to delete theirs, I cannot comprehend how good that made me feel that I helped to inspire you guys, I am so proud of every one of you. Thank you for all the love and support. I’m blown away and feel incredibly uplifted right now."
i want a hug,2390,hhbowe,223,i don't remember the last time i got a hug. like a genuine hug where you feel the warmth of someone else's body and you feel safe in their arms. i want to feel that feeling again. i just wanna be okay
Sleeping is the only activity I don't hate because it's like a free trial of not existing,2392,80zbhr,91,"Dreaming is also a bonus. Sure the occasional nightmares are bad, but at least it's better than being awake, where you feel bad 100% of the time."
I’m sorry.,2389,h0i1jv,307,"I can’t do this anymore. I’m sorry.



Update:

I am so sorry. I didn’t think anyone would really see this. I had a panic attack at work and I went home. I wore myself out and fell asleep. I just woke up. I am so sorry.

I don’t feel like myself anymore. I feel like I’m losing touch, like I’m outside my own body watching myself. I feel sick. I don’t even know. I’ve never felt this bad before. I’ve never felt this alone. 

Thank you to everyone for reaching out. I’m crying from the support. I wish I could hug everyone. I need a hug."
I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life,2386,kgmy1e,104,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

Edit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did. You guys have given some real good advice and I'm thankful for it, thank you."
"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?",2386,eczhm3,385,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition. 

Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you."
"i feel like when a lot of other people say they did nothing all day, its completely different than when i do nothing all day.",2375,j0okgo,130,"Other people will talk about how they did nothing and all they did was, go on a walk, go to the store, play some video games etc. when honestly their day seemed pretty eventful, like if that’s their nothing then what is a good day for them? when i do nothing, i actually just kinda do nothing. I just sleep and lie in the dark and just, idk be sad. Maybe get up just to go and eat or go to the bathroom but thats it yk. Idk its weird.


edit: wow i just woke up to all of this thanks everyone :)"
Why I stopped opening up.,2369,d01jay,241,"""Bottling emotions is extremely unhealthy. You know, you can talk to me about anything.""

*dumps brain onto poor unsuspecting soul*

""Wow, you should talk to a therapist about that. I believe in you though!""

Edit: Thanks for all the supportive comments. To those suggesting I not open up to people who don't get it, I completely agree. This has happened to me when opening up to people who used to be very close friends who don't really have the time for me anymore. I'm not just dumping my brain on anyone who asks."
I often fantasize about something tragic happening to me so I have a reason to be depressed or don't have to participate in life for a little while,2366,g76n13,89,"Just today on my way to work I found myself hoping somebody would lose control in the rain and cause an accident. I've even imagined contracting covid-19 so I can self quarantine and not have to deal with life for a couple weeks

"I almost checked myself into the hospital because i was at my breaking point 2 days ago. I punked out.

this is big for me bc i’m always in my own way. i’m still shocked i left the house. i usually look for every reason not to, even if it’ll help me. 

just wanted to share that bc i didn’t have anyone else to tell

edit: this isn’t a post telling anyone what to do or promising a fix. trust me, i know meds and therapy isn’t for everyone. this is just my own experience and me being hopeful :) a huge!!!! thank you to the folks who have left kind words. ❤️ you’re very much appreciated. i’ve replied to as many as i could lol thank you! i hope that you all find some peace."
Normalise 👏 Men 👏Crying 👏,2360,hzla3e,167,"For me crying is a really good emotional outlet, but i know everyone irl judges me for it because men are supposed to be unemotional robots

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive",2348,g8eq07,145,"Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one. I don’t think anyone will have read this anyway."
When you're lying in bed and you slowly feel tears from in your eyes and roll down your face you know its back. But it's not even back because it hasn't left in the first place.,2349,iwhnis,109,Today is one of those days where I feel miserable haven't gotten out of bed. I just feel awful.
"I don’t wanna kill myself, but its 4:49am, I’m about to go to bed and I’m thinking about how nice it would be if I just died in my sleep.",2344,krk3a3,190,I would disappear from existence forever and I’d never even know it
“You’re faking your depression because you look happy”,2337,hoauh0,239,"I fucked up. My colleagues/friends at work asked me in which Reddit group I posted the most stuff. And I said in r/depression without thinking. Because my brain is a slow, stupid piece of shit. So they said “Just because you get sad sometimes doesn’t mean you have depression” and “A lot of people are faking depression nowadays” while they both suspiciously looked at me as if I’m some kind of murderer. 

At work I’m super “bubbly” and “happy” AND IT IS FUCKING EXHAUSTING. After they said all that, I became too awkward to reply. So I walked away, hid myself in the back and started acting like myself again. I just sat on the ground for a bit. Did nothing. Felt like shit but also emotionless. Like I’m floating. Empty, alone and misunderstood.

I’m definitely not faking my depression. And it freaking hurts when people don’t believe you because you “seem happy”. I automatically become fake happy at work or with friends even though I despise being like that. Faking and socializing takes up a lot of freaking energy so when I’m finally home I’m just dead in my bed.

I’m not positive or bubbly. I’m a negative piece of shit who can’t even leave her bed most of the time or brush her teeth everyday. +a shitty past and a shitty present and had a burn out and no support and so on. Yay. Super happy.

Ps: Sorry, I swear quite a lot when I’m upset.

Edit: Just wanted to say thank you for all the support, kind comments and my first award c:"
Does anyone else sleep a lot to escape the pain?,2338,e2gnrw,248,"I sleep so much. I enjoy it because it’s an escape without death. I don’t want to die but I don’t enjoy living, so I sleep.

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",2325,doqwow,175,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them."
I think my wife saved my life this morning.,2313,lbdal4,91,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me. 

Sorry for the rambling, but I figured I just needed to get it out of my head."
I'm breaking apart and no one gives a fuck.,2317,d3mqe2,209,"I swear to God, if I manage to kill myself and someone say some bullshit like ""If only she talked to us we'd have helped"" I'm coming back as a ghost to make their life a living hell.

Keep your problem to yourself and your therapist because everyone else WILL use them to hurt you."
My 17yo lovebug doesn't remember me anymore,2313,fsg8zk,62,"So my cat apparently got alzheimers and it's breaking my heart... All the things we have been through, he has been there for me like no other person in my life has, all the play and joy, hardships, running in and out to the vet, petting him and loving him, waking up every morning with him looking at me and meowing, following me downstairs and watch me make coffee... and now, all that is gone. It's like he seized to exist, wiped out his hard drive.. I got him when I was 14yo, my cousin gave him to me, when she learned I had a hard time because my mom had cancer and also breaking up with my father. My life was in pieces... But my cat, he mended my heart. He gave me love and support when no one else did. He was there for me, always, no matter my mood, and I loved him so so much... Now he is gone, but his physical self is there, but none of his personality, he stopped doing all the things that was him, he is only existing atm, doing all the necessary things like eat, drink, sleep, poo... But not making contact with me, not cuddling, not meowing. I look into his eyes and I don't see him there anymore.. I am so sad right now I don't know how to think positively about the future without him. I feel completely shattered.."
Can anyone else go from feeling neutral to hopeless in a matter of seconds because of something small?,2313,jdzbnw,132,"Ive just dropped and smashed a plate in the kitchen and cleaning it up, my brain took over of telling me how useless and stupid I am because i cant even hold onto a plate. Its so humiliating for myself.


Edit: Im just about to go to bed after settling down and it took a few hours for me to get back to my normal mindset. Also, the responses to this have been eye opening as i really didnt expect anyone to pay attention. Thank you all for comments and i hope we can all manage to get past the difficult times brought on by not so difficult things. 🥰❤"
Being alive is a scam,2306,eaqn2p,167,"I get panic attacks over simple things this shit sucks bro

Suicide ice cream,2290,6mplah,156,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible
"
Does anyone feel like the less interesting person while hanging around other people?,2290,edhcd2,221,"Like, your presence is not important, everything would be the same even without you."
I’m killing myself [update],2283,dcb40b,135,"So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it. Instead face it head on, and say “fuck you depression, I’m better than you.”"
I remember thinking about people who had depression. Now I’ve had it for two years and it’s impossible for me to believe that there are actually people who aren’t depressed.,2283,jwyqsr,172,"I cannot possibly imagine life without depression. Being happy? What the fuck is that? What’s having an awesome family like? never had one. Can you imagine being smart, at the top of your game? I can’t. 

I’m just a nobody. I die, and the the world continues as always. The entire thing is just pointless. We live, we die. The end."
Why do I feel bothered and ashamed by things that sometimes happened literally over 10 years ago and the only person that probably remembers is me?,2286,hu0e15,131,"I woke up and immediately started looking for things to be bothered with, I'm tired of this.  


How do you do to let go of things?"
"People don't realize that coming over and just sitting with you, watching tv or having food or whatever, while you're depressed is the best feeling.",2283,cxnela,92,"I usually decline social events when I'm really depressed because who would want to be around a depressed person, right?

So, I'll stay home by myself, which makes me feel even more isolated and down. But it's not that I don't want to be around people. I just don't want to pretend all night that I'm this other person -- I do that all day at work; it's exhausting. 

But to have a good friend come over and just be there, just sit with you while you watch Tv, it just makes me feel loved, which helps chip away at the sadness just a little bit."
"Does anyone habitually say things like ""I fucking hate myself""",2284,9ld1ak,262,"I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. 

It's reached the point where instead of saying ""fuck"" when something goes wrong I'll say ""I want to kill myself"". It's become so engrained in my mind that I've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around. 

Anyone else do this?"
"Is it just me, or is it like you dont actually have a reason to be depressed but then just all of a sudden you are just overwhelmed in sadness?",2284,hvgovi,222,"I dont have a reason to be depressed but. Its just sometimes i feel fine and then all of a sudden i just dont want to do anything and i feel an ache in my chest. Idk man. I guess it might be that my parents arent able to bring in no money and its just in my conscious and pops out evry now and then. Am i just faking my ""depression""? 

Let me know if im the only one that feels like this?

EDIT: I just want to say that i tried responding to all the messages but i just got overwhelmed and got busy with trying to help my dad with work. but thank you to everyone who gave me words kf encouragement and i am deeply sorry to everyone who feels the same way. oh and thank you kind person for my first gold award! :)

EDIT #2: Thank you to my second gold award. i really appreciate it alot. but you people really dont have to spend money to just give me a virtual award. but i an thankful and it does make me kinda feel wanted. thank you <3"
"I'm not living, I'm just existing",2269,kcet9a,105,"Do you know this feeling?   I feel like I'm nothing more than a vessel.  I feel like I just want to scream, all this hopelessness and the suffering is too much for me. But this vessel helps to contain and suppress these feelings. I feel dead inside. Just existing cause I can't bring the courage up to kill myself. It feels like I'm trapped between a livable life and death."
I wish I could give my life to someone who actually wants to live,2267,eihb2v,144,Fuck New Years by the way
"I want a hug. A real one. Not a hug of pity, not a virtual hug.",2257,lwc907,242,"I want someone to hug me because they want to. I want someone to hug me because they want a hug too, not just because they pity me.

I don't want a hug from my mom, my grandma or whatever. I want a hug from a person who didn't brought me here. I want a hug from who wants to be with me, because they are attracted by me.

I'm sick of pity. I want real affection.

Edit: I'm living in France for the ones wondering."
I feel like I'm wasting my life being depressed.,2260,gcqww5,157,"I feel like I'm wasting my life being depressed.
I keep hearing 'give it time, it'll get better'

Yeah
Maybe eventually it'll get better and I'll have wasted the better part of my young adulthood trying to figure out how to produce serotonin.

We only get one life, and I've already spent a quarter of it feeling like shit.

I honestly hope reincarnation is true because if not then I've thoroughly wasted my one chance at a halfway decent life."
passively suicidal?,2256,lpab4d,215,"does anyone else find themselves constantly just thinking about dying or disappearing and just not wanting to exist but also not committed enough to end things? 

like I find nearly nothing redeeming about my life - I know there's good in it but it's just not enough anymore - so I just daydream about dying so I don't have to pretend to be okay anymore. I'm not planning to kill myself, but I find myself wishing I could because this disinterested floating through life is just pointless"
I hate when you finally start to feel a bit better in life but then a bout of depression crashes down like a wave.,2252,liznl9,59,"I feel like I’m drowning on land, I’ve been thinking a lot about suicide lately. It feels like just a short time ago I was starting to feel happy and excited about life. Now I just want it to end, I was fooling myself into thinking there is something worth living for. Maybe things will change but I’m doubtful right now.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind messages. I also want to say I understand my suicidal ideations involving other people is wrong and I promise I will not put another persons life at risk should I choose to follow through with suicide (which I am hoping not to) I am still in a very dark place but your words of encouragement and support have helped me see things a bit more clearly."
I did it.,2242,ib0526,102,I finally talked to my mother about needing to see a doctor/therapist and she was understanding of me. I had so many worries in my mind. I’m proud of myself.
"“People with depression don’t want to die, they just don’t want to be alive”",2245,bejryd,165,"This quote helps me to explain how I feel, when people ask questions about depression"
Can depression make you hate being around people?,2243,ipyosm,139,"I know I'm going to sound like a horrible person. But lately whenever someone talks to me I find myself just wishing that they would stop and leave me alone. I find every single person I interact with annoying in one way or another. I don't know what's going on. 

I never express my annoyance, of course. It's not their fault."
"Anyone else have underlying sadness even when doing something ""fun""?",2226,bvup45,171,"Like I'll be out trying to enjoy myself and I'll be having a laugh or having a bit of fun but I still feel sad underneath, hard to explain but nothing feels fulfilling. Even hobbies I have just seem dull and I'm usually just trying to mask the pain so I don't have to feel. 

I hate this."
Realizing that you will die because of suicide is really hard.,2223,clue8y,288,"Sometimes it just really hits me that maybe not today or tomorrow but eventually I will commit suicide. This realization really fucks me up. I wish this wasn’t the case. I wish so much I could be normal and happy but it’s been years and I’ve begun to really accept that my suicide is inevitable. I hope I’m proven wrong.

Edit: it’s been 160 days since I posted this and although not much has changed in my mindset I still come back often and read all the new comments. Those of you who commented or will comment I see you and just wanted to say thank you we’re not alone and although things suck they suck a bit less together."
Forcing myself to do things makes me hate them. Doing nothing makes me hate myself.,2218,k0rvk5,94,"The first advice you see on googling depression is 'do things you used to enjoy!', right? Well, I've gotten really good at making myself do things. I make myself do my job. I make myself do a side hustle. I make myself read books and post about them on my blog. This month, I'm making myself do NaNoWriMo.   


I presume the idea is that, at some point, you start enjoying things again, but I haven't ever managed to get to that stage. I dread my side hustle. I never know what to say about books until I start writing. I write exactly the number of words I need to hit my goal and then I stop. I don't enjoy any of it. Some of it, I really hate. And I've been doing the side hustle for a year and five months, and the blog for two years, so it's not a matter of it 'give it time'. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to make myself do things if I don't treat them as obligations. Anything optional, I just don't do. It feels like a vicious cycle where the only way to make myself do something also makes me hate it! Is there a way around this? Has anyone else felt this? I can't seem to find anything online that even mentions this being a problem, let alone actually proposing a solution. 

&#x200B;

I'm trying to make myself go for a walk every day, because that's supposed to be good for your mood, and it feels like an actual punishment."
Anybody else feel like they're quietly panicking all of the time?,2225,co4r6g,153,"Like, not a full blown panic attack, but just the constant uncomfortable feeling of something not being right?"
"Do you ever lay there in the dark, just staring into the nothingness, and then 5 hours went by somehow and you cant remember if you fell asleep or not.",2221,cuqta6,99,This has happened to me twice this week. I think I’m dying.
"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.",2217,jy2o4t,162,"I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

Edit: thank you to people who are commenting. I am having a hard time finding words to reply to people. I dont really express myself easily.

I really appreciate everyone here. Its nice to feel understood."

My elderly father gave me a beautiful smile and asked how I slept. I dont want to make them suffer. If it weren't for them I would've killed myself already. They are also sick and need my help. I cant a abondon them. I'm so sick of living, but I have to live for them. I just want the suffering to end, and dying is the only way."
I'm so fucking tired of begging for help. I NEED HELP. Being ignored is why I'm going to wind up dead.,2200,il9hic,242,"I'm so tired of my feelings being ignored by my friends and family. I'm tired of the emotional abuse I have been through. I'm tired of dealing with having bpd. I literally cannot do this anymore. I CAN'T. I feel so empty and nothing feels worth doing, I have no friends, and I'm hurting. I don't know how I'm going to do it, but I'll find a way. I genuinely believe that in killing myself I will finally find some peace.

I truly don't think anyone cares about me or that this will hurt anyone, but I'm sorry if it does. I'll be watching over you from above and same to anyone dealing with these same issues.

I'm sorry I just can't do this.

Edit: Thank you for all the awards and comments I have recieved. I've done my best to reply to reply to all of you because I appreciate all of the time people took out to comment on my post. The amount of love and support I have received is overwhelming. I hope you all know that the I reciprocate the love and care you have shown me. You guys gave me some hope and even made me cry a little. I feel better and if anyone else needs help, please reach out to me so I can pass on this good energy. This made my day so much better. I love you all. "
"Anyone else feel like their ""fake depressed""?",2196,7tk5tf,160,"it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. Most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like ""your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen"". I don't know. 

EDIT: Hey so i'm not the only one who feels this way. If anything it's slightly comforting to know that

"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident",2192,bkit8n,109,"I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything. Sure is loads of fun."
One of the shittiest feelings is having a dream where you're genuinely happy then waking up to reality.,2180,6lbzd6,97,This happens to me a few times a year. It's like my brain is teasing me.
"Just started therapy after 20 years of being depressed, then it gets postponed because of the pandemic",2173,fl010g,119,"It's like my life is a sick joke or something, the one time in years that I finally want to get better, it has to get fucking postponed and I'm stuck quarantined at home, isolated and alone. What's the point anymore"
"Does anyone else get random moments of clarity where you think ""oh crap, I'm actually very mentally ill.""",2170,cxbnat,119,"Had one of those today. It feels like, for just a moment, I understand that I am indeed suffering from an illness. It's such a strange contrast from constantly thinking ""You're not actually sick, you're just a terrible person.""

Anyone else experience something similar?"
"Depression can cause weight gain or weight loss, but saying you've not been eating is seen as much more socially acceptable than saying you've been eating too much. Even though the cause is pretty much the same.",2173,i24936,121,"I've both gained and lost weight due to depression, but I feel people see weight gain as much more embarrassing or just overall negative than if you *lose* weight as a result of depression.

The cause is the same, but everyone sees weight gain as disgusting. It hurts."
I’ve been working out the last 150 days. I want to kill myself even more,2164,lx1glt,209,"It never ends. Everything I do sooner or later becomes another chore. No happiness, no joy. Just nothing.
I sat down between reps to my chair, and wondered about suicide for 5 minutes.
Fuck everyone who says eating healthy or exercise could fix this shit. Sometimes it just can’t. And it makes you more miserable."
"I'm so unhappy with my life, that I cope by living in a fantasy world I created in my head.",2157,huimca,195,"I just put on music and space out. Avoiding all responsibly because I'm a coward. In this world I created, I'm a hero, I'm attractive, people listen to me, I'm content with life. Now compare that to my actual life where I'm an ugly pathetic disappointment. I think I need meds."
I posted a meme on Facebook about my mental health being bad rn and no one reacted or responded. I just saw in my feed that a friend copied and posted it themselves has loads of comments and reacts saying how loved she is and how much she matters to everyone.,2158,jtnmad,128,"I know its stupid but it just got to me. I mean I barely have any friends on Facebook and I know I wouldn't want to be a bother on any of them anyway but like 1 care react would have been something. Sorry just needed to vent.

Edit: I just want to be a bit clearer that the people commenting and stuff on her post are not shared friends, she has a large friends list of people I don't know where as I barely have anyone on my friends list.

Also I know facebook and social media are just awful for mental health but I sadly can't delete it as I need to for my business and sadly as much as I try and just use it only for that I get sucked in from time to time.

While I'm editing I just want to say thank you for the supportive messages and everything you have made me feel a lot better though I'm sorry to have vented at you all I kind of figured this post would mostly be ignored as well and I'm sure there are far more needing people you could offer support to. But still thank you. x"
I wish I could have a fatal accident instead of committing suicide.,2157,dyazjo,158,"I want to die and leave this black hole of self hate and overwhelming sadness. I have a wonderful husband and two amazing teenage boys, and yet I find no joy in life. 
I don't want to commit suicide and scar my family that way. I just hope every day that I'll have a fatal heart attack, stroke, or get hit head on by a semi."
Sleeping is better than being awake.,2154,he3cji,166,Feeling numb makes sleeping the best option.
I just killed my pet bird.,2150,iyz4y3,148,"What is even the fucking point anymore? I took my bird out when the door was open and it flew off my shoulder. In a moment of panic I slammed the door... right onto his head. Everyone in my family is telling me “it’s not your fault” and “it was a mistake”, but guess who always fucking makes mistakes? ME. And now my mistakes are causing the deaths of those I love. I hate myself so much I don’t even see the point of going on anymore.

Edit: Oh my god, thank you everyone! It’s been a really hard day and the support I’ve had from my family and you guys has helped a lot. It’s still an on going process, but I’m trying not to blame myself for it. Hearing your stories actually helped a lot, it let me know I wasn’t alone in this and that it is possible to move on. Thanks guys :)"
Addicted to depression,2141,gs581g,191,"I don't know am I the only one with this, but every time things start going better, it never feels right. I feel like I don't deserve being okay. The sadness has become like an addiction. It feels weirdly good? 

I don't really know, but whenever I'm the lowest it feels the most comforting. I think I've already gave up on trying to heal. Trying get help. I don't want it anymore. I'm miserable and slowly becoming crazy but I don't think I'm even trying to fix it anymore. I've accepted it. 

I'm just waiting for the opportunity to finally bring myself to the end."
Why the fuck does being alive always have to feel like an uphill battle. I can't fucking ever keep up.,2146,bgtydh,94,I'm so fucking tired of feeling like i can't ever catch up. To anyone or anything. I can't keep up with life I'm so fucking tired of it. Why do I always feel like being alive is an uphill battle. I feel like i was damned upon conception. I was fucked from the start. With my fucked up head and my fucked up emotions I was FUCKED FROM THE START. I never stood a chance here. Why the living fuck do I always feel like I'm a thousand steps behind everyone else. Sometimes I want to end my life so badly but I am too afraid to hurt my family. I keep holding out for some god damn hope but every single fucking time it is proven that I am hopeless. I don't even know why I am on here I do not ever talk about my emotions nor do I ever post on reddit but i'm just so tired I don't know where else to put it... I don't think that I will ever be happy. I don't think I will ever live my life to the fullest. I don't think I'm going to ever change the world or be remembered. I don't think that I will ever amount to anything extraordinary. I don't think I will fulfill the wishes of God or whatever the fuck put me on this earth. I don't think that I will ever love myself. I don't know where else to go.... so I don't go anywhere. I remain here in this stagnant cycle.
I hate waking up from a dream where I'm happy,2142,gzmxu1,135,"It literally ruins my day before it even starts. I'm so tired of being happy in a dream. Being married, having fun with my friends, having money, and then I wake up. I literally wake up with tears in my eyes. It was so bad this morning that I repeated the words ""I wanna die"" over and over. Why does my brain tease me with this? I swear if I didn't have my cat to cuddle I would be in a worse position."
I'm getting more and more stupid.,2133,f2qwaw,191,"For a while now I feel like I am getting progressively stupid. Information doesn't stick, common sense doesn't kick in and overall I really struggle following conversations and responding correctly. I'm always lead in bed at night cringing about stupid things I've said, things I should of said, how slowly I've been to react to something and overall how useless I am. I feel like I'm turning into a sloth. My body is so heavy and every now and then I have to kick myself up the ass to get a move on because I've blinked and ten minutes has gone 
by. I don't recognise this mess that I've become and I just wanted to know if anyone else gets this and if so how to get out of it? I'm miserable and what's worse I'm frustrating for the people around me and getting a reputation of being slow and overall useless. Help 😞"
I feel like I’m getting dumber and dumber everyday.,2135,jo8hjk,264,"I don’t know if there’s something physically wrong with me or if it’s just stress related, but for about 2 years now, I feel as if my cognitive abilities have been worsening. 

I can barely hold a conversation anymore. When I do talk, I stutter/stammer/mispronounce words. My mind blanks out a lot and my attention span is nonexistent. 

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school. Then after high school, I became a full blown hypochondriac along with having generalized/social anxiety as well. 2 years ago I felt like I was THE man, and today I feel like an incompetent moron who becomes less functional each day. I think I’m recovering from my anxiety disorders, but I sometimes wonder if I’m actually just normalizing them, causing the illusion of recovery.

I don’t know where to go. I’ve really been trying to get better but I feel like I go two steps forward and three steps back. Can anyone else relate to this? Currently typing this out standing in the shower, feeling pretty down right now.

EDIT: ironically enough, I forgot to mention that my memory is complete shit now. My long term memory isn’t bad but holy shit, I’ll forget what you said in a conversation 10 seconds after it’s said."
"Going to therapy feels like repeatedly opening the fridge hoping new food has magically appeared, but not finding any",2137,hf150j,127,I feel stupid for feeling hopeful before every appointment. I know she can't help me if I can't help me.
"I’m not lazy, I’m depressed",2124,ilzp93,112,"I literally can’t function like a “normal” person without help. I wanna be able to do things like y’all do. But I can’t.

Edit: Hey y’all, I know it’s annoying to see an edit but I just wanted to say thank you for all the upvotes, comments, and awards. This is the first time I’ve ever received this many “likes” and comments on any social media platform as well as getting any awards here on Reddit. I didn’t think this would ever happen to me. I know I shouldn’t let internet points affect me, but I do feel a lot better knowing there are so many of you that are going through the same thing as me. Thank you again, I really appreciate everything."
Waking up the day after you planned on killing yourself feels like glitching outside the map in a video game,2124,kfvd68,113,I feel so out of place right now
I play video games every waking moment so I can avoid thinking.,2115,m17x3m,164,"Being alone with my thoughts is so awful. It’s painful and difficult and I have absolutely no control. I just ruminate on so many painful memories, I get trapped in thought spirals affirming all of these awful assessments I’ve made about myself in the wake of primarily trauma and abuse, but there’s a lot of elements of truth to them, and I can’t really avoid thinking about them or that, unless I manage to avoid thinking at all. I just wake up and do the bare minimum to exist (and often times don’t even achieve that as I dwell in self neglect...) and pour every minute o can into video games until I’m exhausted enough to pass out within minutes of laying down, because if I don’t then I’ll lay in bed for hours making myself (even more) miserable. This is so awful and so difficult and it feels impossible to do anything about it. I am in hell."
I’ve been diagnosed for 20 years - yesterday I quit my $100k+ high pressure sales job to become an 8th grade science teacher.,2115,b5unuc,184,"Yesterday I made the decision to make mental health my priority, after years of telling myself money can make me happy.  

Yesterday I decided to be happy.  

Thinking about you all.

Edit:  never received gold before, so thank you kind stranger.  
Also, to those saying teaching isn’t easy, no one said that it was easy.  Everyone has different personality traits.  Please remember this is a post celebrating mental health, and to instill hope in others. 

Edit 2:  another very large deciding factor - one of my best friends shot himself in the head on Christmas Eve 2017.  The impact is real.  "
Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,2110,g1jxci,74,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post. 
I truly appreciate it."
I had a personality once but now I can't remember who i am,2107,d2pnl8,152,"J remember i used to be funny. I used to laugh and make jokes. I remember being able to hold a conversation with people. I wanted to know people and give back. I was shy but querky,  talkative and funny around people who knew me. 

Now I'm nothing. I don't seem to laugh or smile anymore. 

I feel numb and unsatisfied with everything I do.

EDIT: wow thank you everyone for your responses. I thought this post would go unanswered honestly but its so comforting and reassuring to know that I'm not alone. We just have to find the strength from somewhere to keep going on. 


On a side note..

I'm not sure if anyone else feels like this but.. I sometimes think part of the reason is I have this intense fear of losing people. So much in fact that i start believing In  the values and hobbies of the people in my life in the hopes they'll like me  and not leave. I just agree and comply with everything. I've done this for so long I just don't know who I am anymore."
"God dammit. I should be able to tell people I have suicidal thoughts sometimes without them freaking the fuck out. I feel like killing myself sometimes. There, I said it. Doesn't mean I'm going to do it.",2102,bcfuxd,137,I told my wife yesterday that I have suicidal thoughts sometimes and what I'm doing about it to feel better. Needless to say she went over the top about all the reasons I shouldn't and then went and told my mom without my permission. Guess I'm not telling her anything anymore. I'm in this shit alone.
"Depression is when you don't really care about anything, anxiety is when you care too much about everything. And having both is just like hell.",2100,4i203m,145,
I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead,2099,emnl5m,208,"If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. 

I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. 

No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. 

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

Edit: thanks for all the responses! Let me rephrase something here. I dont wish I had cancer. I wish people treated depression as seriously as cancer. I'm not trying to diminish the pain cancer causes."
"Woke up, realized it was Christmas, and broke down sobbing.",2102,effx75,119,"I just woke up an hour ago. I don't know why, but I always really struggle with Christmas. I started getting so sad that it was getting hard to breathe. The worst ideations I've had in a while. I almost blocked my fiance because my brain kept telling me that I'm a problem. Thank god my brother came in with the puppy and it snapped me out of it a bit.

Hope everyone is safe today."
I wish I could donate my life to someone who actually deserves it,2094,hqw1wy,111,"A while ago I got into an argument with a guy because he implied that I was immature for complaining about being in college. He said, ""don't forget you're taking up space in a class someone else would love to be taking."" Even before I heard that, I felt like I was a waste of space and resources, but that of all things just made it so much worse somehow. I've wasted pretty much every gift I've been given and all I want is to die in peace but I can't even do that.

Edit: thanks for all the replies everyone! I wasn't expecting this to gain so much traction and it's nice to know how many people care :) Thanks for the award as well!"
Nobody talks about the memory loss,2091,dlp6ws,310,"I have days where I feel like I'm being gaslighted or getting dementia. No told me when I was diagnosed about the memory issues. So if this is news to anyone here, you might be going mad but not in the way you think. Its just the shitty disease."
It’s my 25th birthday today. Even though I don’t mind living in solitude and actually prefer it often due to my mental illness symptoms— birthdays remind me how much it is my own fault and my mental illness made me lose all friends in my life and that I truly am alone.,2097,e8wf5e,191,"Spending it yet again treating myself to gifts and food. 
Even if friends were there to celebrate it with me I just can’t keep up with the energy of pretending to be happy. 
I’m always stuck in my own world of depressing obsessive thoughts and need to be left alone.

"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices.",2094,ce7tl7,122,"Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.  
&nbsp;

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.  
&nbsp;

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

"Is ""bearable"" the best it's ever going to get?",2093,kvu83e,162,"I eat 3 healthy meals a day. I exercise. I managed to bring my hours of sleep per night to 6. I make it a point to interact with friends and family at least once a week. I take my meds. I go to therapy. I have done this for more than 2 years rigorously.

And yet I'm still always tired. I still don't enjoy anything. I still feel like the useless little shit I was before. It's just wake up, do my routine, go to sleep, repeat.

I suppose I could reach the other end of life without taking shortcuts like this. But fuck me, is it the best I can ever hope for? To just to sort of keep going?  Why should I put in so much work for so little payoff???

Fuck."
Does anyone else wish that you could sleep forever?,2093,e6wilf,175,"I'm NOT speaking suicidal.

I just want it to be like I never existed in the first place.",2092,g4xe5j,115,"Nothing interests me anymore, I just feel numb and anxious and insane every day I just wish I wasn’t here from the beginning. I’m a burden to my family and a waste to everything and everyone else. I wish I could just press a button and erase all traces of my existence from the world."
The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly.,2088,lnrzv6,149,"If I don't wanna keep going why should I? I had no choice in my birth and I don't have a choice really in my death either. I mean I could off myself but no one would really respect my choice. I don't know, I don't get much joy out of life. I never really had much of a chance to, I get some but I don't know if it's worth going on and on forever. I hate all of the obligations there are to stay alive. I stay alive mostly for other people, I know that's important. I wish I could be selfish and die. I used to think growing up that once my parents both died I'd just kill myself too, I feel like that might still be a good plan for me. 

I have goals and desires, as well as things I want to do. But I also don't really enjoy life. This is all selfish I'm aware. Perhaps it's wrong of me to think this way but I feel resentment towards my existence. Resentment towards the obligations and feelings I hold towards others. Resentment of my love for them and their love for me. I daydream about becoming a major asshole to everyone, just so I can off myself and have people celebrate my death. But I also can't bring myself to be a jerk."
Does anyone else get those little highs that last like 10-15 seconds where you feel like you can do anything and are genuinely motivated and no one can stop you..but then it passes and you're back to feeling like complete shit?,2084,5cgdww,138,

Burst into tears because of Animal Crossing,2080,gk067l,108,"I’ve been having a really rough few months and my depression’s been more intense than usual, so I got animal crossing 2 weeks ago in hopes of it calming me down when it gets bad. 

A new villager just moved onto my island, and it started singing while staring at the lake. I started crying because it was just so pure and cute that it made me realize how fucking depressed I am. Social distancing, being quarantined, not seeing my friends, becoming recently single, on top of my mental illnesses have been so overwhelming. I’m so tired of being alive and I wish these feelings would just stop."
"I don't want to die, I just don't want to exist",2081,m48twp,126,"I'm just really tired. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't talk about not wanting to exist because people just think I'm suicidal. I think about it a lot, but I'd never actually do it. I know the effect it would have on my family, and I wouldn't wish that on them. I wish I could be selfish in that way, and do something for myself, but I can't let my family feel guilty for something that wasn't their doing. I guess I'm just going to have to settle for the constant urge to fast forward through all this bullshit until I can finally die."
I feel like my life is a TV series that should've been cancelled 4 seasons ago,2073,kk84zd,45,"Nothing brings me joy anymore, not even my greatest accomplishments make me feel anything, kind of like a show that's run its course but the showrunners keep finding ""cool"" and ""wacky"" scenarios to put the main characters in, but nothing hits like it used to.

"Anyone else used to be bright in school, but now feel like a bum?",2074,cayc5n,211,"Sorry if my language sounds harsh but that's how I feel about myself now. Used to be a good student, not too bright but put an effort, dreamed to study in the West, teachers kept telling me I'd go places.

Now unemployed (only an unstable freelance job), living alone with no friends and no energy to pursue any hobby anymore. Play video games pointlessly, then sleep, usually with an empty stomach.

Such is life. Hope y'all doing ok.

Just to clarify, as long as you feel like a bum, it counts. Depression doesn't discriminate I guess."
Anyone else just feel bored of everything?,2077,bjx3nl,222,"I dunno. Nothing excites me anymore. I wake up and I don’t know what to look forward to. I’m not having any suicidal thoughts and I don’t think I ever will, but I’m really struggling to feel happy."
Anyone else stay awake late just because the idea of “tomorrow” feeling exactly like today is such a depressing thought?,2068,9o8sa3,98,"I know depression can sometimes be sleeping to much or little, but this is different.

It’s just that knowing that I’m not going going to fall asleep and stay asleep, that I’ll wake up in the morning and have to do this all over again, is so soul sucking that I force myself to stay up as late as I can. "
Beirut Explosion ended me,2060,ix5il7,64,"First off I'm a lebanese 24 years old and You can't imagine the life I'm living here. Our house got destroyed in the beirut explosion and my dad got injured. 

My mom is sick (multiple sclerosis) and We can't afford her medication anymore. 


Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... 

I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. 
My father is unemployed too. 

We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. 

To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse .. 

We are stuck in a war between Israel and Hezbollah. We are innocent educated people who speak 3 languages !! I have a license in physical therapy which I got and cost me 25 thousand dollars and it's useless. My father is an accountant who worked so hard and now our savings is gone! There is no fucking dollars anymore! 

I'm doing physiotherapy volunteer work but now it's starting to do more bad for my mental health than good. I'm working 8hours and getting payed 0. I'm angry every morning about this and specially before sleeping

I'm just done. I'm really lost and I can't get out of this country with no savings and if it wasn't for my parents I would have ended my life a long time ago. 

Sorry for my rant but I needed to post this somewhere."
I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,2064,dkx9yc,248,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Edit: more questions

Edit 2: Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to write to me. I truly didn't believe this would reach this many people. I will try and reply/read everyones post but I am still in the process of seeing a lot of specialists. But I am truly grateful for all the love and support that has been sent my way. Thank you, I will make you all proud and try my best to implement all of the tips into my life."
I feel like years of depression has given me brain damage,2060,jyo9pv,143,"my memory is SO bad. i can’t focus, i can’t concentrate. and throwing ADHD and anxiety in the mix hasn’t been great either. but the worst thing is my memory. i used to be “the smart kid”, in school, but now i can’t remember shit so i’m failing several classes. i’m tired."
"no identity, no personality",2053,j1158l,122,"Does anybody else feel like they 'are just there'?

I feel like there is no depth to me. I have no interests anymore, everything feels like a chore. I don't feel like a real person, only a spectator - I am here, but not really. I have no personality. I pick up some traits I see in others, or on TV. I feel like I am just a mix of various people I've considered interesting, and I just impersonate and mimic them. I just live and do what others want me to do. I feel like an empty shell. I daydream all the time, and sometimes feel like I am losing touch with reality. Sometimes I can't recall what my face looks like, all I see are parts of it, and it feels unfamiliar and uncomfortable. 

I have no idea what is going on with me. I've been growing more and more suicidal each day. I just wish I could feel okay for a moment."
I’ve been staying up until 5am playing video games and then sleeping until 3-4pm everyday,2051,l02zo4,195,"I have no desire to get up earlier and do something with my day even though if I could force myself I’d probably feel better. 

It starts to get dark within an hour of waking up usually and it’s so depressing but it keeps me isolated in my “comfort zone” 

Being up in the middle of the night feels freeing for some reason, no one awake, no guilt for responsibilities, I can sleep away the day and not feel guilty about it.

But I’m wasting time and I want more than anything to feel okay again. I want to start to get my life back to something that I can derive some genuine enjoyment out of and move forward with productive things. 

I became depressed again about 10 months ago since my mom passed and these past 10 months have gone by so fast, I’m almost 26 and I’m scared at how fast time is moving without any stability forming in my life. 

TLDR: I’m 25 and I feel like I’m wasting time, which I am. But it’s so hard to even attempt to start getting my life in order. 

It feels so far out of reach"
Anne Frank,2050,jse4m7,94,"She really said it best:

“Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude.”

God damn, am I sick of being alive. I’m 29 and really can’t envision another 60 years of wanting to hurt myself, feeling like no one gives a fuck and hoping I die in some type of accident."
Does anyone else get morning depression?,2043,jdjfr2,196,"Every day when I wake up, I feel suuuuper depressed for the first few hours of being up. For the rest of the day it comes and goes but it’s every morning without fail."
I feel like suicide is inevitable,2036,k016wa,214,"Not that I want to kill myself right this instant but it feels like it's too late to prevent it. Something bad is going to happen later on down the line and then I'll just end it. There's no way around it so long as I don't die suddenly in a car crash or something. I feel like I'm one of those people who just never gets better.

Edit: why did this post blow up this was just a depressive vent post

Edit 2: why is this being given wholesome awards reddit baffles me sometimes

Edit 3: I feel like I should add some context to my depression that may differ from your own experience. My depression mainly comes from a place of self-loathing  and my own inability to accept myself. I have people who I care about and who care about me but I feel like depression has manifested into my personality and it is a part of who I am now. This is why I feel that suicide is inevitable for me personally."
I wanted to kill myself at 8 years old so I swallowed a bunch of Flintstone vitamins.,2037,i8ifzj,119,"I laugh at it now after all these years. I had seen it on TV that someone committed suicide by od. All it did I think was give me an upset stomach. I'm 27 now. Honestly surprised I'm still here. I've been feeling very suicidal the past couple of days. The only thing that stops me is my baby brother I take care of everyday. When he goes home though, I don't know. I just hope my mood is better by then. I know part of me doesn't want to die but the feeling is so forceful and impulsive."
Hate when normal people ask me what I've been doing all day and I have to lie.,2035,carjo7,165,"Nothing ok, I lay in my bed depressed and slept till 6pm alright? Sorry I can't be normal and productive like you up at 9am with 50 friends. I'm a creature of darkness and death, you wouldn't understand my life you grew up with a happy loving middle class family. My entire life has been suffering and hate everything. I'm so tired of pretending I have a job and pretending to be normal. I'm exhausted."
Done with waiting for change. Done with hoping things will get better. I’m going to push myself even harder now ... even if it kills me!,2028,icqyvd,99,"I’m fed up of waiting on other people. It’s clear nobody really gives a shit about me.

So sod it. I’m going to go and do my own thing. No help from anyone. I’ve gone this long being a loner I’ll just accept it’s my life. I’m going to adopt a do or die attitude and this will end either with me ending myself or something beautiful. I’m going to apply for every job under the sun. I’m going to write this book I’ve been putting off. I’m going to claw my way out of debt.

Wish me luck my friends 💓 I have nothing left to lose."
Did your depression mess with your attention span?,2027,gfqlvd,192,"Because i cannot bring myself to focus on things  i could do normally before, be it hobbies, watching movies, reading, and so on. All i feel is lying down all day and doing nothing.

edit: mixed feelings with the responses ive been reading. Sucks to hear that I am not alone with experiencing this. I just hope that some day, some miracle might happen to our lives and bring back the spark we once lost."
i'm not doing any better i just got better at hiding it.,2015,b96mck,142,"instead of called in from work or breaking down during my shift i cry on the drive to work.
instead of ranting on instagram or ranting on facebook i cry myself to sleep.
instead of telling people how i feel, i say im fine and smile knowing no one could understand how fucked iam.
instead of threating to kill myself, ive come to terms with the fact that i'll be gone soon once i get to my breaking point and end it all."
Anyone else feel like maybe you are just starting to get it together and then one little f*&# up sends you plummeting into the abyss again?,2011,belqun,237,"It does not even have to be a major incident, but that tenuous grasp you had on climbing out of the hole, that little bit of hope that things are starting to turn around, suddenly releases and you are plummet back into the pit; and now you are too damn tired to try climbing out again ..."
I isolate myself and then feel angry when people don’t notice.,2001,mhozjo,107,"Depression is a bitch. I don’t want attention, I just feel worthless. Being my only company feels toxic because I hate myself. It’s so conflicting because I want to be alone. I don’t have the energy anymore to put on a fake smile like I used to. I distance myself from my friends and they don’t notice. Yet I don’t want to be alone because I’m drowning in a pool of self hatred and depression. I try to reach out and force myself to meet with people but plans always fall through. I just want to be reminded every now and then that people care for me because I feel fucking worthless. It doesn’t help when that validation never comes."
I want someone to notice how not okay i really am,2005,coglq2,209,I feel so empty. to the point that things i used to laugh at i no longer find amusing. Call me a coward but ive never told anyone about the way i feel maybe in order to be able to carry on with life with no more complications. I just want  someone to hold me close and tell me its going to be ok. I guess this is my cry for help.
It hurts realizing who you really are,1999,c5tb40,167,It hurts realizing that your not this deep down to earth interesting smart person. Realizing you just a piece of trash that is useless. It doesnt matter wether im here or not. It just breaks my heart to realize that.
literally the only thing in my life keeping me from going completely off the rails is my cat,2001,hx450i,139,"i love him and as long as he is around i will devote myself to his care, comfort, and happiness. beyond that i do not give a shit. he's my reason. he's why i work and take my meds and try to at least pretend i see a future for myself that doesn't suck. i would do anything for him, including stay alive. 

and if you have an issue with that or think it's funny or whatever, hey go fuck yourself."
I’ve been in quarantine in my head for 2 years,2001,fkaiqz,50,I’ve been stuck living in my head and it doesn’t seem like I’m getting out anytime soon.
“I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone“,1992,buy4zh,54,"This quote by Robin Williams has destroyed me. I’ve realized why I hate being with people more than being alone, even if I’m smiling and having fun. 

*EDIT* wow, thanks so much to every single supportive comment. means more than the world to feel supported. to everyone suggesting social media is a cause of this- is not the case here. i don’t use social media, because I know the conversations on there don’t follow me to my grave ❤️ real life human connection does. today was a good day, thankyou everyone for your love."
"25, an aging, worthless failure",1991,egdm43,326,"I have failed in nearly everything I had set out to do. I have no confidence to do anything else. 

I have no proper education, no friends, no job, no travel experience, no positive memories, no good relationships with anyone, no confidence, no productive hobbies, no self worth, and no future.

I'm worthless trash at the peak of my youth. The people I grew up with are pursuing their dream careers and traveling the world, enjoying their lives. I am sat here taking care of my needy family, looking for pathetic jobs, and engaging in escapism to forget that I am who I am.

I am 25 years old this year, a stupid idiot, a weak coward, a life loser, and a complete waste of space"
"""Suicide isn't an answer"" Yes, but it seems like an option.",1993,kqdxq7,216,"The only real option. The only button that ends eternal pain and suffering. Fade away from everywhere and become nothingness. All your sorrows and misery, agony gone in the blink of an eye. And you know what's the best part? It's free! You don't need to pay to kill yourself, but you need to pay to live. It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness.  

But I am here to live for the mental well being of other people, so they don't be sad. I suffer for them. Yet they wouldn't take a minute to listen to one of those millions of thoughts I have ruining my head. Ironic."
Holy fucking shit I can’t stop beating myself up over past mistakes,1992,lce9ou,128,"I think of a name, a face, a place, a year—the only things I can recollect are negative. I’ll just be driving in the car or sitting in my room, then these thoughts hit me like a fucking locomotive: “Remember that stupid weird shit you said 6 years ago?” Or “remember that group of people whom you tried to befriend earlier in freshman year of college only to be rejected, and you didn’t really care for them much anyways but holy fuck, you are so dysfunctional and weird and retarded?” It goes on, “remember how you chose to not talk to that cute girl who showed clear-as-the-fucking-day signs of interest in you but still opted to not talk to because you’re that brain dead and insecure?”
It doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past. I involuntarily think of these social/romantic/academic/attention-deficit/practical failures, and then I think of how great it would be if I could just roll over and die, never mind how. No more mistakes. No more disappointments. I’m tired, I’m tired of being tired, and I’m tired of being tired of being. I’m not suicidal, yet at the same time, I feel like I’m just one bad day from doing myself in; however, I could never do that to my friends and family. It’s a weird fucking feeling. I don’t normally post here... Thanks for coming to my TED Talk on Stupid Bullshit.

Edit: Thanks so much for the support. Stay sane and stay safe!"
I love sleeping because my dreams are better than reality,1984,iwv0ns,118,"I hate waking up to my alarm every morning, i just wish i existed in a never ending dream."
"I am so tired of ""just taking it one day at a time""",1986,ererwo,120,"There is always another day. And another. It never stops, no rest."
"I think about suicide everyday, but I’m not planning it",1982,iot9f4,96,"Why does my brain constantly resort to wanting to kill myself? Every single day that’s my answer, I want to get it out of my head because I feel like if it continues for too long I may do something.
I have nothing planned, I just think about it all the time. Why is this?"
Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?,1978,fvcm3g,108,"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted. In the same way that people say 'once an addict, always an addict', I've come to believe the same thing about my depression."
I made it.,1967,j2kjtx,77,"Yesterday I went to a clinic because of my injured leg. While I was talking to my doctor about my injury, suddenly I had an urge to talk about what I’ve been feeling for the past 5 years. It took a lot of courage since I never talked to any adults about it because I was too anxious and scared. I cried, my hands were shaking and I couldn’t really talk properly but what I knew was I finally seek a proper treatment. I knew I was depressed and the doctor diagnosed me with it. I’m only 18 years old this year and I’m currently studying at college right now. I’m embarrassed when I remember the way I broke down in front of the doctor. But I did. I finally talked."
Trying to succeed in college when you’re depressed fucking sucks.,1963,jr9klb,160,"Everyone says “try harder” or “I know you can do it” and all I wanna say to them is shut the living fuck up. I can’t try harder and I can’t do it, if I could I obviously would. I know they care but they’re also being inconsiderate by assuming I’m just choosing to fail my classes. I’ve been struggling with depression for a few years, I feel the lowest I’ve ever felt right now. I’ve in therapy and I take meds and I still can’t handle all the pressure and responsibilities of living. Depression kills :/

Wow, I did not expect this to reach so many people. I have read any single kind comment everyone has left, sorry if I haven’t replied immediately I’m trying.

I was with her for 2 years now and now i'm just alone. Nobody is with me. My mom and dad both hate me. I don't even have friends or something. I dont want to leave my home, i dont want to eat, i don't want to drink. I just want my girl back.

I struggle to even find the motivation to sit on my ass and play video games,1943,mds5ps,109,Most of the time I lay in bed hoping to fall asleep (username checks out). Everything feels so pointless.
I have no personality,1944,ds57wd,173,"Does anyone else feel like they have no personality because of depression? For me the downward spiral started when I was 11 or so, so being depressed is basically all I remember. I don't know who I was before that, or who I am now. 

I always just feel like a carbon copy of whatever person I'm talking to, putting on a fitting mask and trying to please them with the personality I fake for them. I can't, for the life of me, tell you a single characteristic of me, except for my anxiety and depression. 

When I'm alone, I tend to talk to myself (probably out of loneliness and the longing for actual human interaction, and yeah I know it's weird) and then I feel like a blanc slate. Like there's nothing to me.

Does anyone else want to kill themself but they don’t want to do that to their family so they go by day by day with the only true motivation in their life being the day they finally grow distant enough from their family that they can end it all without the guilt,1930,bwfo05,172,The worst part is now I have a girlfriend that I’ve dating for a while and I’m crazy about her and we’ve talked about our future together numerous times and she’s the single that can prevent me from reaching that true point of fully distanced from those I care about and it somehow makes me sad instead of happy
Does anyone weirdly find comfort in their depression?,1929,bdl2gg,148,"When I feel ok, I feel off. When I sink into a depressive mindset, in a twisted way my brain feels almost satisfied.

This might make zero sense, but it's a feeling I've had for so long."
Did anyone else's depression fuck up their career or university/schooling experience?,1926,8shf3a,277,"I was a high-achieving student in high school, went to university and shit hit the fan, graduated a year later than everyone else and is still unemployed 9 months later.

Keeping up communication is rough sometimes. A day of not replying to a message can become a week when you don't know how to explain that you just couldn't be around people that day, which can become a month when it always seems impossible to reach out and explain where you've been.

Edit: I've gone through each and everyone's reply. And I have only one thing to tell you all; thank you for listening to me! Thank you for all the kind words! and the gold really made my day :)"
It's lonely.,1920,dvqbw0,127,"I've been crying nonstop for 3months. Getting into university have made my condition worst. It's lonely here. I want to tell more but I just have no energy to type.

Hope those who read this.. good day to you.


Edit:
I didn't believe that my first post will get over 1K upvotes. Thank you for all the kind messages. Thank you. I have read all of it. Thank you. Truly made my day better. I will try to hold on and to those who are struggling too, keep your heads up too, try to love yourself, ourselves more. We can't lose hope."
You ever wonder if your just faking it,1912,f7m2s8,137,"Like you will feel sad all the time then happy for mere moment before your brain hits you with the"" damn bruh you were faking it for days"""
being alive is so fucking painful,1907,k15h4m,139,"existing takes so much work.

i cant do this for much longer.

might be leaving soon."
Scared of sleeping because tomorrow will start,1902,euni91,71,"Lately I’ve been neglecting sleep because I can’t overcome the anxiety of having to wake up and think about all the things i’m behind on whether it’s school or even socially. It feels like when i’m awake a long period of time I can just manage my stress. Unfortunately as i’ve been neglecting sleep it’s gotten me in trouble with my parents and it’s mostly because I have a hard time telling them the truth as to why I’m not sleeping.  Idk just feels like i’m trapped.

EDIT: I find it hard talking to my parents or a therapist because I hate when people feel bad for me. I’ve seen one therapist in the past and it sort of worked but I always feel awkward and embarrassed telling them my problems."
"i don’t wanna kill myself, but i don’t want to necessarily exist either?",1906,dkkejd,169,"like, i wish that instead of having my crappy, depressing consciousness being tied down to my body, i could just exist as a floating, formless concept instead. right now my mind and body feel incredibly heavy and all i can do is lie down in the dark. i wish i could be free and light and weightless.

i don’t want to kill myself. i doubt i’d even have it in me to inflict physical pain on myself. but i don’t wanna exist like i currently do either. can anyone relate?"
Have you ever had to physically “fight” with your own mind just to keep yourself together?,1904,f39n7d,161,"I can not describe this better. Like I am literally fighting with myself physically so I do not lose touch with my surroundings and not get lost within my head.

It is so tiring.

Edit:

Damn, guys. I...am touched. I am just amazed to be honest how many of you struggle with the same shit every single day. Thanks for the kind words, for the support you show here. <3
You are all breathtaking. <3

Edit 2: I thought that this will be such an insignificant post. Turned out a lot of you feel like this. It is...sad and amazing at the same time."
Depression turned me into an idiot.,1901,hjerm3,132,"I used to be quite a bright kid, at least, according to what everyone said. After years of trauma and abuse, however, depression completely overcame my life, and after so long, I feel it has utterly destroyed my brain; fried it, like an overloaded computer. I genuinely forget how old I am sometimes. I struggle doing basic math. My short-term memory has deteriorated to nothing. Etc. I just feel as though I'm slowing down only more each passing day. If I can ever beat depression, would I have any hope of restoring my cognitive ability at all?"
Anyone wish there is a redo?,1899,gl8he5,220,"I just want to turn the clock back 10 years and redo everything, and right all the wrongs. Now I can't, too late and too much.

Edit (05/24/2020): I did read all the comments, thank you. This thought of regrets have tortured me so much: a simple choice a decade ago still haunts me today and looms over me. In the past two weeks, wrestling my inner demons, I lost so much weight and have lost so much mental curiosity and interest I used to possess. But recently, after watching Being Erica as some of you recommended, I realized that ""no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself."" I suppose regrets will come in different forms, no matter what I do or try, the outcome would be the same that I'd be short of what I desire to be. To be honest, I don't know what a solution could be here, but I suppose seeking it is part of that endless struggle. "
Has anyone ever felt they won’t ever reach their full potential because of their depression?,1901,cruf0x,141,I would like to hear your thoughts.
Anyone else previously cared way too much and now is completely apathetic to everything?,1895,bd1ro7,160,Yup... that’s me. I think this is the depression that completely scares me most because days pass and I don’t do anything at all and don’t accomplish anything because I don’t give a fuck and then I look back and so much time has gone to waste
please someone just fucking read this,1891,m3to6v,177,"everytime i try to express my self i dont know how to do that and im always ignored. im 16 but i feel like im 30, i was adicted to liquor, weed and pills, rn im trying to be sober but drugs ruined litteraly everthing i had, i fucked up a lot of friendships, my mental state is getting worse and worse everyday, i still got ptsd from my mother who fucked me up when i was a kid, i'm barely making ends me, i have anger issues, i fucking hate myself im fucking ugly fat, everyone i meet forget about me in like a month, i barely sleep, i stutter i can barely even speak, i never had a girlfriend im so fucking alone.

thank you for seeing this and helping me"
I'm just saying I've never been thankful that I didn't kill myself,1888,jp1zmd,208,"Ever since my first suicidal thoughts when I was like 14 (22 now) people say ""aren't you so thankful you're still here?""



No. The answer is always no. I've never once thought I'm glad I didn't do it. I've only ever regretted NOT doing it. If I had just acted on my first suicidal impulses or any of them after I'd have been so much better off. Not a thing has happened I should've cared about missing.



My life has only gotten so so much worse. Now I WISH I felt how I did when I first felt suicidal. That was roses compared to this shit and I actively wanted to die then too. My life has gotten so much more fucked up than i could've ever thought then, and I really only would've missed out on suffering.



I've only been alive because 1. Suicide is way harder than people think and 2. I'm supposed to and guess what?


I'm not thankful for it. Jesus Christ do I wish I had just killed myself 8 years ago or *any* time since. I've never once been thankful for not killing myself"
Have you guys ever felt like doing something but depression just makes you stay in bed?,1895,fxthns,165,"like if i wanna play some video game my brain will be like ''nah go to sleep'' and it really pisses me off, because i feel like im letting the days pass, and with this corona virus out there, if i die, i would've enjoyed the thing that i most love in this world, which is gaming."
I wanted to kill my self last night but instead I called an ambulance,1890,br6vgb,121,"No real reason for posting I’m just proud of myself for making the choice I did.
Edit: this is not what I expected. Thank you to all these wonderful strangers for the support. In the real world, only my partner knows that I even have depression because I don’t want to stress people out. I’m honestly so overwhelmed. I thought I would answer some common questions in an edit, and I’ll slowly get to each comment as I can 😊. Firstly the cost- I’m an Aussie and I have private health insurance, which includes ambulance cover, so it cost me nothing. I can’t believe some people have to pay. I wouldn’t have called if I knew I did. Second - what happened after I called. I had my live in boyfriend with me, and they came in and asked me some questions (eg had I overdosed / self harmed etc.) I explained that I had accidentally missed a few days of my medication, and then had several extremely stressful incidents occur over the space of the days I forgot them. I called because I started to feel like I couldn’t trust my brain, and I had a plan I was worried I would act on when my partner left for work in the morning. I had also had a panic attack right before I called, which I had never had before and oh boy was that scary. So off I went. It was all very gentle and calm. I basically just needed someone to watch me while I waited it out / for my meds to kick in. I slept in a nice room, was allowed to keep my phone so I keep in touch with my partner. In the morning I was given my meds (I had remembered them the dish before). I had various meeting were they explained that they were happy I called, it was just a relapse, forgetting my meds didn’t help. I had a long meeting with a doctor where I went through everything (I was first diagnosed 5 years ago with PTSD and depression) and the difficulties I’ve had getting help. I had a good doctor for a while, but she moved. So they set me up with a new doctor with hours the work in my work schedule, and a new therapist, again that work in my work schedule (most psychs in my area that bulk bill don’t do after 9-5) (bulk bill = in Australia medical services and partially covered by our public health system (Medicare) is the doctor only charges what they cover, it’s referred to bulk billing. Basically it’s free (but covered by your tax dollars)) They also renewed my mental health care plan (my document a doctor gives that allows me to access the psyc services at little to no cost) which I hadn’t been able to renew as my new doctor couldn’t fit me in. Lastly I was put in touch with a community mental health program a few streets from me who have given me a case worker. I haven’t meet her yet, but basically she’ll contact me regularly to see if I’m ok, and can be the person to find me doctors and psychologists when I’m struggling too. I’ve nicknamed her my depression pa. Lastly they recommended I get my dosage upped a little bit. Then I was realised (it was about lunch time) and got sushi. They also rang my boyfriend a lot (plus me texting him a selfie every 30 minutes on his request) to keep him updated, and to run down my plan moving forward."
"i want to tell people ""don't worry, i hate myself way more than you could ever hate me""",1886,el7p7n,111,"like if they are judging me or don't like me, trust me i know. i hate all of those things about myself and more."
Do you ever feel too ugly to leave the house?,1888,bt0kck,153,"Hair doesn’t style right, my makeup looks off, my outfit looks like crap. 3 hours of getting ready later....and I just cry and don’t end up going out. This is my life 90% of the time trying to go anywhere. I’m exhausted, and I hate it. Anyone relate?

Edit: Wow, by the likes it seems like I’m definitely not alone. Thank you for sharing. Sending you all well wishes that we can overcome this feeling and feel adequate, as I know we all deserve to feel accepted in society as we are. Hugs to you all 💜"
Just because my depression started during the pandemic doesn’t mean I’m depressed because of the pandemic.,1881,mkx1uq,83,"I’m tired of everyone acting like my depression will go away when the pandemic ends as if I’m just a little down because of the pandemic. People get depression all the time. Millions of people are depressed, and their depression starts at all different times. I would have been depressed regardless of the pandemic. Not every person who became depressed during the pandemic is just a little down because of the pandemic. 

I have struggled with mental health my whole life. I have diagnosed anxiety which I have had since I was very young, and now I have been diagnosed with depression. Mental illnesses have run in my family for several generations. Other factors in my life have left me susceptible to depression too. I do not care about going to restaurants or going to the movie theatre. I see my friends at school and I still have to fake a smile around them before I go home utterly exhausted from it. This isn’t me just being a little sad over the pandemic because I miss my friends or going out. This is me being clinically depressed. 

Do people think that people just stopped getting actual depression as soon as the pandemic started? What I have isn’t the same as someone else who feels a little down because they miss going to parties."
Anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older?,1889,84osqo,235,"Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. I would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and I didn't realise until I was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back. "
I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,1887,fmfemk,180,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

What will the cops do about it when they come?"
Please don’t give up on me,1883,hp3jcj,114,"I’m trying. I haven’t been happy in five years, but I’m trying. I think about suicide every day, but I’m still here. I’m hanging on. I’m trying to believe that maybe I’ll find happiness again. Maybe I will find Faith gain. Maybe one day I will find people who care. I know you see me struggling and I feel you look at me with eyes of disdain. I hear your thoughts. *”She’s a lost cause” “she’s too much” “i wish I had never talked to her”* I know you don’t like me and you would probably be happier without me but I’m begging for someone to please stick around. To please not pull out. Even if you just pretend to care please don’t give up on me and maybe even just pretend to believe that I can get better. Because I can’t do this alone - and if everyone around me leaves, then why should I stay?

Edit: thanks for the awards and support. it means a lot. ❤️"
y’all ever just give up mid-day and zone the fuck out and start staring into space for prolonged periods of time?????,1879,c0ffzy,110,"like i was at work and my body just shut down and decided not to try anymore so i just stared into space for what felt like 5 minutes, but was actually 30. fuckkkkk this"
Do you ever just cry for the person you used to be?,1876,bf4t53,149,"Even with my chemical imbalance I used to be an active, social person. I was fun-loving and outgoing and for the most part happy.  Now it seems all I do is go to work, come home and sleep. I want to do things I used to enjoy but I’m so drained by just surviving. I try so hard but I can’t push myself to. It breaks my heart and I grieve for the person I used to be because I don’t feel like she’s even a part of me anymore."
I fucking hate being depressed all the time,1876,ctxsee,78,"No, I'm in no danger of offing myself so no need to send out the cavalry. But I am so tired of having to remember what it feels like feel good instead of actually feeling good. I'm tired of having to remind myself that how I feel is not normal. I'm tired of having to remind myself my feelings are separate from me. I'm tired of having to distract myself from my feelings to get through today.  Every fucking day. I'm tired of feeling like crying everyday all day everyday. I'm tired of having to have some mild stimulant just to feel whole. 

Pardon the pun, but my depression is fucking depressing."
"You ever want to cry but, physically can’t",1875,cmxonf,165,"I’ve been wanting to cry for a few weeks now and it’s become hard for me to cry. I don’t know necessarily know why I want to cry. The other day I was watching Endgame and Tony’s death always gets me sad but, I couldn’t cry like I did when I saw it in theaters. I want to cry but I physically can’t. Why?"
Does anyone else hurt so much emotionally that it feels physical?,1872,e1dmmd,191,"It feels like i constantly have a negative feeling in my chest, that's constantly there all day, but feels like it gets way worse when I feel more lonely/sad/negative.

I've never hugged anyone before, so when i sleep i hug a really soft blanket I have, to feel at least somewhat better, but i always feel even more lonely and i usually cry, and I've noticed that feeling in my chest gets much worse when i feel worse emotionally."
Is anyone also more happy/relaxed when no one's around?,1864,hcv348,146,"I have gotten used to being alone and I always somehow feel way better when I don't have any friends. It just made me realize that I can't hurt or disappoint anyone in that way.
I genuinely feel more well and less depressed.

Now I'm wondering if this is actually normal or not? Can anyone relate to this?"
23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old.,1864,hcl4eo,197,"I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

There is this little person jumping inside me wanting to live, but my brain and heart is just so done."
I have no personality,1864,fhu4s5,161,"I think I’m a very boring person. My personality is flexible and fragile. I easily change when I spend a little bit of time around someone. It’s hard to explain but imagine a chameleon changing its colors.

P.S Thank you for all the upvotes and comments!"
You’re depressed because you’re not grateful,1863,czo1ne,246,Today I got told that “You only get depressed because you aren’t grateful for the things that you already have.”
"Nobody at all cares how depressed you are when you're alive, as long as you don't kill yourself. Now if I kill myself, then I'm just a huge selfish jerk who didn't think about anybody. Jerks...",1868,44spqj,219,
"Fuck me, I'm so tired of pretending.",1863,dk44jz,108,"I am always the guy making jokes and making people smile and helping them out. Truth is. I just use everyone as a distraction from my own shit life. 

I'm an introvert pretending to be extroverted."
I live in my own fantasy world because reality is too depressing,1863,i75o0p,119,I just distract myself all day with fantasy because as soon as I snap back to reality I feel empty and depressed.
I’m 20 but in my head I feel like I’m 16,1856,ih6eox,161,"I’m 20 but I feel exactly the same as when I was 16. It’s so frustrating and pathetic. There’s so many things I’ve missed out from what other teenagers would experience and I’m just never going experience those things in the same way. Like having a crush in school/sixth form/college. Waiting for their classes to finish so you can see them, spending time together in between lessons, studying with each other, catching the bus together then doing it again the next day"
Somebody noticed I am not ok,1853,ed99oq,88,"Went to a doctor today because I suffered an injury while drunk.

The doctor (God bless him, amazing person) saw right through me and asked if I was Ok. Actually pretty much told me I'm not Ok mentally. Asked what happened to me, how do I feel, why do I drink. Gave me recommendations to a psychiatrist (for drinking) and to a psychologist.

It was nice for somebody to notice and to be so kind and interested. It was way beyond his job description.

I'm a bit sorry I opened up only in the most generic terms, but I was already on the verge of tears.

Unfortunately ppl close to me are oblivious even if I'm giving all the signs. They get annoyed with me if I don't wear my happy face, but I can not bear to put it on anymore.

God, I hope I can take something from this doctor and try one last time to fix myself, because I can't live like this anymore."
I don't want to kill myself but I just wish there was a way to stop existing.,1854,bsl0x7,154,"I just want to stop existing, no one would have any memories of me, nor feel sad as they wouldn't have known me.

Is it so bad to say, I didn't ask to be here, my life is shit and hard, I'm very sad and I just don't like this ""life"" game. I just want to go back to my pre birth state of not existing."
Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?,1848,9au31d,207,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses. "
"Today I brushed my teeth, took, a shower, exercised, vacuumed, played with my cat, stayed hydrated, and read a book.",1853,5r62ik,133,"Still want to die. Still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. Still a burden to everyone in my life. 

Edit: went to bed after writing this post (I say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your kind words. 

Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments. I'll be honest, I just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but I appreciate this community so much. "
"Each month that passes I feel sadder and sadder. Please, somebody read me.",1852,l50p1h,119,"Hello.

Ever since I was little, I've been very emotional. As time has passed and I've been able to understand better the world around me, I find disgust. I dislike how everything is money and manipulation and how you can't do anything if you don't play along. My family is broken and I can't share my feelings with anybody, and when I do is usually with my mother and she always makes me feel worse, or guilty about everything. I feel like an idiot.

I used to go to therapy before the pandemic, it was quite good but sadly my doctor passed away due to old age. I'm not in a place right now where I can pay therapy. I'm also not motivated. I just want everything to end. I want to stop being me. I don't want these memories anymore.  


Thanks for getting until the end."
I don’t want to kill myself but I don’t want to live.,1851,farc3n,149,"I’ve been feeling like this for about the past week or so now, and it’s been really bothering me. Ive been depressed for about a year or so and it’s getting worse. I don’t want to live, but I don’t want to die. I feel like I’m stuck in a quasisuicidal state.I keep having the thought of just pressing a button that would just instantly take me out of existence. I fantasize about being asleep forever. I feel like I haven’t been myself for years. I feel like I haven’t been able to think straight and I’m constantly worried about tons of shit, but I don’t have enough motivation to do anything. Does anyone feel the same way? It would be great to know if other people feel like this.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies. I’ve been reading every single one, and it comforts me to know others feel the same way I do."
I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,1848,e9uflv,131,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol."
"I’m not actually living my life, things just happen to me and around me",1842,grs9bp,71,"Sorry if this is spam or whatever. But does anyone else feel like this? Recently it feels like things are just happening to me, but I don’t feel anything. Like I’m just going through the motions, like a robot on a set program. I wake up, then go about my routine, then before I know it I’m back in bed in the evening, and I might as well have not done anything during the day, because I didn’t even experience it, and I didn’t even put any thought into it. Time passes so quickly, and things just happen around me. It’s like someone else is living their life and I’m watching it from their point of view. It’s a weird feeling."
Im begging somebody to read this I desperately need to feel like I have a friend there for me right now.,1843,hzah5n,121,"Posting this on a few subs because I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve reached my breaking point. 


Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way. My heart hurts so much but I’m such a glutton for punishment that I can’t bring myself to stop carrying around all this hate. And it is absolutely one hundred percent consuming me alive. I’ll try and use brackets to section off my thoughts since I doubt anybody cares enough to actually read this all the way through. 



 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow."
I survived my suicide attempt..,1833,axjmof,194,"Yesterday I had lost all hope and just went ahead and hung myself from the ceiling fan.. made sure to lock everything so I can't be saved. As soon as I moved the chair under my feet I thought my neck would break cuz it was considerably high but it didn't happen, had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts really bad. 

Half a min in I went unconscious due to the severe pain, woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood( I don't remember how long I did stay that way but apparently not long enough). 

Had a long talk with my parents and it's better now, I'm not sure what's gonna happen next. 

Edit:- I'm 17years old"
My sister saved my life yesterday.,1831,gem759,86,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know. Thats why i like coming here. It hurts but I feel like I must press on."
I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do.,1834,lr8zpz,143,"I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

""what are your projects ?"" 

I hate these questions. Because I can't see any lights in my future, only pain, stupidity and failure.

When people tell me these questions, I just look at them stupidly, because I can't reply ""in a grave, or maybe in a river, maybe the streets ? I have no idea""

Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,1815,jpqevo,104,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person. Spooky."
The only reason I survive my days is music.,1814,jrla14,177,"All day I have my headphones on, I even sleep with them because sleeping otherwise is impossible. My family hates that I do this and everyday I can hear them complain about my disinterest in everything. Can't even blame them, nobody likes people who are basically broken pieces glued together by a pair of headphones and a sound."
I want a hug from someone so bad.,1807,kbc8yt,249,That's it. I just want to feel secure and warm. Touch starvation is a real bitch
"""I think the saddest people always try to make everyone happy because they know what it is like to feel worthless and don't want anyone else to ever feel like that""",1806,3xyzw7,126,Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.
Keeping myself alive is just so much work for so little reward,1803,jusevs,54,"My parents don't understand how I could be so lazy that I never want to heat up any of my food to make it taste better -- I just think the difference in taste isn't a big enough reward for the amount of effort it takes.

"Depression is having no drive, purpose, passion, or commitment",1799,c67izj,103,"I go through life with a lingering sense of worry, fear, doubt, uncertainty, regret, and utter lack of passion or drive. I am constantly worried about something going wrong. Lack focus and passion for what I do professionally and have no confidence in anything. I feel like i am going to get exposed as a fraud and get fired and not find another gig. Toxic mix of having no confidence combined with lack of drive to do anything about it creates chronic and lingering sense of anxiety and the vicious circle continues"
Can someone read this ? It’s my full story,1797,k4lq26,180,"If I can have at least one person read this, it would make me feel really happy because someone can get the full picture of my life.

I’m a black 17M in high-school who lives in the USA. My interests fall in computer science, math, video games, and anime/manga. When I was younger I loved video games so much, and I still do to this day. Video games were the reason I was planning to work at a game development studio in the future. I felt more understood by VG’s than I did with my family. 

I’m not close with my family and I don’t ever will be because they are toxic af. I’ve been psychologically abused and nobody would ever listen to my end of the story. They are the major cause for my depression, and some for my suicidal tendencies. As more time passed I would stay in my room as much as I can because I whenever I would step out, my parents would drag with them to some store, usually insult me, or whine about how lazy I am. My mom has been more abusive, but at the same time she is an idiot who I was able fool on a few occasions. My dad is annoying and racist. For some ungodly reason he hates white people, which makes me embarrassed to have him as a father. My stepmom is stupid and racist so I can’t stand her. Certainly least, my sister is a literal bitch, who has no regard for anyone’s feelings. 

School is the worst thing to have ever happened to me. I don’t even know where to begin with school because I have had so much shitty stuff happen to me. Elementary school was ok. I was easy target for harassment, but it’s not as bad as it was in middle school. When I was in elementary school, I never saw the importance of school. I barely did any work, and never bothered to pay attention in class. Almost everyday in elementary school, I just looked forward to going home and playing on my Nintendo DS. It was my major motivation back then.

Then came middle school. This is where so many problems came to rise. Words cannot describe how horrible my middle school experience was. This is when school pressure really started hitting me and that I felt the need to work harder. I had only like one friend in the beginning of 6 grade, and by then I began getting bullied by having that friend. This friend of mine was seen as very strange and weird by every other student, but I defended him and decided to go through constant harassment so I can keep being his friend. One day at the end of the year, my science teacher decided to expose me In front of the class because she got so sick of me not turning my work. I don’t blame her though lol. Next is 7th grade where there was no end to bullying. Throughout the school year, I tried so hard to fit in and be like everyone else, but it really backfired making me look more like an idiot. I would do the most retarted shit just for attention because I felt so lonely. Worst idea ever. Now those memories are stuck with the other students who went to class with me. I asked I crush out and she rejected me (wasn’t much a big deal, but I did feel pretty embarrassed after). Almost all my friends were fake, and would easily turn their back on me. Whenever I was alone, thoughts of self harm would become more frequent, and whenever I wasn’t I was being harassed by someone. The last day of 7th grade is literally the worst day of my life. Completely lonely the first half, then, midday, I accidentally fell in some chalk that was on the concrete, and it ruined the clothes I was wearing that day. My “friend” saw this as the perfect opportunity to embarrass me in front of much other students as he can. Almost immediately when he found out, he literally started running around the school and tried to tell almost anyone nearby about how dumb I looked with chalk on my clothes. Students nearly when they saw me just gave a weird look or an expression of confusion. I was so suicidal that day. Next is 8th grade. Not as terrible as 7th, but still bad. I was admitted into a 9th grade biology class because of my great grades in 7th grade environmental science, but the biology class was horrible to be in. The teacher was absolute shit, and made it harder for us just for the sake of it. When I came in that class on the first day, I almost had a heart attack because there were so many students who were admitted in this class and I knew none of them. Some of the other students I sat with hated me because I got some of the concepts confusing. Insert some more embarrassing moments then you have 8th grade. High school is better then middle school, but I still hate school in general. 9th grade: I’ve never been so lonely. 10th grade: My existential crisis began. 11th grade: suicide attempts. 12: burnout and more suicide attempts. I don’t want to treat life as a separate entity, but 2020 killed me this year. I wish I can just take a mental break, but my parents are denying my depressive symptoms. Doing schoolwork has never been so difficult holy shit. If I can’t even do it well in high school, then how can I do it college ? 

Life is so horrible. I get abused for the most minor things and I don’t know what to do anymore. I have no idea what to do for the future because I ruined my grades and I’ve overthought what I want to be when I grow up. I attempted suicide like over 10 times this year, but none of them work. I don’t understand why people just won’t help me, even when I reach out. I wish my life just ended by whatever means. I don’t to be homeless especially at this because it’s insanely cold outside. My point is everything is just not fucking fair. I actively try do the most I can to rid depression and do my schoolwork, but nobody will fucking cooperate with me. Even when I’m having my best day, I still always contemplate on suicide as if it’s the “answer” to my life. I low key wish someone would hug me

But the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “Oh no! You have so much to live for! Think about x,y, and z! You can’t give up! Things are gonna get better!” Yeah, shove it up your ass.

But I think most of all I miss how hopeful I was. Despite everything I fully believed that it'll get better, that the future will be a good one for me. And I've lost that completely.

That was 6 years ago. Now, I want nothing but to get better, but I just keep being my own worst enemy. I want to get a job. I'm 23 and have absolutely no work experience. I paid $2300 last year to improve my grades and I still haven't read a single page. I want to, so why can't I just fucking do it? I have ADHD as well, but that's been with me my entire life so I can't really blame it on that..

I just have no sense of self anymore. I do the same thing every single day. I get up at noon, play video games, go to bed. There's just no productivity, even though I hate living like this. I always tell myself ""I can't take this anymore. I'll start making changes."" What do I do the next morning? Eat like shit and play video games all day.

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing with my life. I'm not strong enough to get up and make changes. Not consistently, at least. I see a therapist every 2 weeks, but I feel like he's starting to give up on me.

Absolutely FUCK depression."
Today was my 21st birthday,1769,1eqtrg,583,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. "
Depression ruined my creativity,1768,gliw37,72,"I can't use my mind in the way that it used to work. I can't think too strongly. I can't think too deeply. I am a shell of my former self. It hurts to use my brain. I have no strength for patience and doing what I want to. I am weak. I escaped depression, but I am weak..

Edit: So many beautiful comments. Thank you all for sharing. I love this community as it's very insightful and you don't quite feel as alone as you may think you are."
"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.",1760,fedwbi,77,"I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care. 

Thanks for reading, I hope you feel better soon and find the key to unlocking your next set of happiness. Along with having a parent who doesn't make your suffering all about them and why you shouldn't be depressed."
Anyone else wake up and mad they woke up?,1758,e1zc9s,162,Like every morning I think oh fuck this again. I can’t do this.
Just got dumped,1753,i9k81v,265,"My girlfriend for 7,5 years just dumped me because “its hard to live with somebody that is always depressed” and because she has more intrest in another man.
This is probably the closest ive ever gotten to ending my own life.
I just dont see why i should continue.

Edit: thanks for all of the kind words, i really do appriciate them.
Right now, about 6 hours after it happend i still feel like my world had ended and that i wanne end it all.
I’ve been trying to do something to keep my mind busy but everything that i do atm, makes me think of her.
I will be fine someday i hope.

Edit edit: i wanne thank everybody who commented,liked, private messaged, and awarded.
When i saw her leave and i knew I couldn’t call her mine anymore i really really wanted to die, i was close to do something i would regret.
I still have those feelings but thanks to everybody here im sure im not gonna act up on those thoughts.
Please everybody when my post faded away, keep helping people in this sub the way you helped me.

P.s. stop making me cry every time."
DEPRESSION MAKES NO FUCKING SENSE,1755,mjimbp,150,"One minute you’re fine and the next you feel so down that you can’t even get up or think or do anything and all for NO FUCKING REASON. Like nothings wrong but you just feel so down FOR NO REASON.  It legit makes no sense.

Update: everyone relating to this actually made me feel a little better, so thanks to everyone. I hope you guys feel better."
"In your experience, is it common to dismiss your depression as just being a bad person?",1747,byvoy4,166,"What I mean is that I constantly worry that I'm not actually depressed, that I'm just lazy and don't want to take the next step in life, that I don't want to put in the work to get where I know I want to be.
So I'm wondering if anyone relates to that"
My depression gets worse during the holidays,1751,kjpy5l,132,"I’ve noticed that my depression gets worse during Christmas, my birthday, New Years, July 4th, etc. I wonder if it’s because I feel really lonely while everyone is celebrating. Does anyone else feel the same way?"
"Y'all ever want someone to check on you, but at the same time be left alone?",1750,mk1q38,83,"Idk what it is, but like I want someone to ask me how I'm doing, maybe let me at least vent for a while. I want to be honest and tell people how much I hate myself, feel like a failure, etc you know how it is. 


But at the same time, I don't want any pity. I don't want someone feeling sorry for me and offering empty encouragement because THEY don't like hearing what's really going on in my head. 


I want help, but at the same time I want everyone to shut up and let me be myself."
"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*?",1738,fj8mva,166,"I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that. Especially when the other one got hurt by her once best friend. 
Anyway thanks for reading... What about you?

EDIT : Thank you everyone for replying, each and every one of you. I haven't answered to everybody. Sometimes I don't know what to say but I have read all the comments, I love you all.

“You have no reason to be tired”,1736,j6rtf8,90,"Am I the only one who hates to hear this? I really hate it, like thanks a huge bunch for once again reminding me of how useless I am. 

Yes, I’m tired, I’m tired all the time even if I don’t do much for the most of the day, and I don’t know why is that so. But the last thing I need to hear is “you have no reason to be tired”, it doens’t make me less tired and it doesn’t make me feel any better."
Do you ever wish you would accidentally die?,1733,804j3g,173,I would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes I wish something else would just do the job for me. 
"Does hearing ""college is the best time of your life"" or ""enjoy being young while it lasts"" freak anyone else out?",1734,crfugo,184,"Because for me, probably like for so many of us here, it forces me to view my entire life as a waste of time. I wouldn't even say I'm looking for help or reassurance with this post, more just curious if this FOMO is widespread. 

I've devoted so much energy towards living the life found in college brochures - tons of social/hobby clubs, going out to bars and trying to dance with people, attending lectures and keeping an eye out for local events (whether because I'm interested in the event itself or because I feel like going would make me seem more interesting) - and I hate all of it. I haven't met a single person I enjoy spending time with. Even my academics make me miserable. To top it all off, when someone detects I'm pretending to have fun and calls me fake or disrespects me it stings for months afterwards. Because we know that's what life mostly is for us: a choice between faking happiness/confidence or revealing just how negative/pained we are and repelling all these people who want to have a good time."
I want to be left alone but don’t want to be alone?,1727,be76g1,98,So I’ve felt with depression for about 10 years now and it’s always so confusing when I push people away but still want them to care for me. Instead of going out and doing things with my friends I’ll stay at home and cry. Instead of reaching out to people I’ll think about how they probably hate me. Whenever I try to explain my depression to someone it feels like all I’m doing is complaining. I’m just so tired of feeling like this. Does anyone else feel like this? And if you have do you have any advice for me?

You wanna know the worst thing about depression (to me),1722,cqd639,90,"It's that depression doesn't kill you desire to want to do things, it doesn't kill your dreams and what you want in life, it just stops you from doing them. It's like being in a cage and outside the bars you can see all the things you can do and want to do but the cage (depression) locks you in and stops you from getting at them and doing them. I dunno but to me that's one of the worst things about it :p"

Hey guys, so.. i don't actually know how to tell this, i won't bore you with the whole story. basically, some months ago, i wake up because of my girlfriends phone, it was her gym coach who, i found out, she was having sex with. i stare at the phone in disbelief, i couldn't believe it. and now that? i woke my girlfriend up, yell at her, and ask her to leave.

Half an hour later, my father calls me and told me to come to the hospital.

It turns out, my mother (who had been fighting cancer for almost a year) stopped breathing. A couple hours later, she dies.

I didn't feel bad about it for a while, but now, been isolated i feel really lonely, sad and heartbroken. i have no one to talk to about this. Also, i now find it difficult to connect to other women because of trust issues.

I wish i could hug my mother in this situation."

I’m not super happy and slightly frustrated over something? Friend says “why are you so snappy lately” or “what do you expect me to do”. Nothing. I just want some empathy since everything that happens in my life is going fucking wrong.

Whenever I'm alone, I might have moments of sadness, but I also moments of joy.



When I'm with others, I forget what my thoughts are really about and it feels like I am caught to spend time with them.




I don't want people to occupy  me or make me happy.

I just want to be how I am. Angry, sad, tired. 


And just deal with my own thoughts without having to tell people how I feel and why I feel that way.





I don't even want help. Because everytime someone tries to help, it feels like they are forcing me into a certain behaviour that I don't want.



It's not that I see my depression as a disease or illness, I see it as a symptom for something deeper. For the fact that I simply don't want to be part of this society, be ""normal"", hang around with others. 


Meeting friends feels so pointless, so shallow. Like you are still suffering but you forget it for a few moments. I don't want to forget, because I actually think the suffering might wanna tell me something.




If your leg hurts because you broke it, you don't just swallow pills or hang around others and everything will be fine.



You have to see what's wrong and adjust it.

"After three months of almost crippling depression, I finally had the courage to call and make an appointment with a therapist and I'm very proud of myself :)",1700,bu3v78,69,"I've been struggling with depression for about three months now. I've had severe depression, social anxiety and panic attacks in the past from 2016 to beginning of 2018, harmed myself and tried suicide a few times, but I started a treatment, took medications and got ""cured"". ~~I guess depression never leaves, right? We just learn how to deal with it and control it but it's probably never truly gone... that makes me terrified. But I might me wrong.~~ 

But now all of this feelings are coming back and I'm panicking. I have no motivation whatsoever to go to work (I'm arriving at least one hour late every single day), I cry every morning and every night, I'm becoming paranoid with my boyfriend and relationships in general, thinking no one would want to be with me 'cause I'm a failure, I get too anxious to reply to anyone, I'm feeling alone, abandoned, ugly, insecure, unworthy, stupid, weak...

I tried to create a to do list to get me occupied. Stop using the uber app to go to work when I can perfectly walk (it's just 2.7 kms - or about 1.6 miles), cook my own meals and stop ordering from an app or eating junk food, start exercising (my apartment building has a gym where I can use wherever I want), go to bed early, wake up in time, have breakfast before leaving the house, reply to all the messages I've been avoiding for months, start to be productive at work and stop scrolling through reddit, get out of my art block and start drawing again, post more things on my artistic social media so I can be more active, start applying for jobs (I don't get paid enough and hate my current job), finding a new apartment to stay (My roommate is my exe's cousin so its a bit... weird?). Just ""simple"" things I thought I could handle and that would make me feel way better with myself. But I can't. I literally can't. Every time I try to get out of bed in the morning I cry 'cause I simply can't. I walk in front of the gym and just want to cry, can't even step on it. Sometimes I can even put on my gym clothes. I turn on my computer I just want to die, my energy starts to drop drastically and its an exhausting task to read my emails and start working. I'm always procrastinating and pushing people away.

**I think the thing that's bothering me the most is that I can't achieve the simplest goals, and I'm failing even on the silliest things in day life**. **I don't have suicidal thoughts anymore, neither the urge to hurt myself, so sometimes I just feel like this might not be depression, it's just perhaps me not trying hard enough.** But either way I can't live like this anymore. I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)"
"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.""",1695,5d2dyi,69,"This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
I have constant passive suicidal thoughts,1697,f9rtou,157,"Recently I think I’ve been okay. Not super happy, but not completely down in the dumps, but ever since about a week ago, I’ve been getting passive suicidal thoughts. If you don’t know what that is, it’s when you think about suicide but have no actual plan or motive to do it. This has happened every day. Even this morning, my first thought when getting out of bed was “I should just die” These thoughts get annoying as it demotivates me from what I have to do during the day, which makes me feel useless, which makes me think about suicide. It’s an endless fucking cycle and I hate it."
I feel like I am too sensitive to live,1691,kp66b8,100,I care so much what people think about me.

Do you also sometimes fool yourself into thinking you are not depressed anymore?,1691,durnrx,166,"Every now and then I start to feel a little bit optimistic about everything. I start to have all these ideas about how I will change things around and become a better person etc. Just to find that the morning after I'm as depressed as ever, if not more. It's like my depression is sometimes giving me a break just to come back and say ""Psyche! You still suck."""
You don't know how much depression affects you until you have a good day,1693,9oqx96,90,"Yesterday I played video games with my best friend all evening, and afterwards I laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier.

Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them.,1687,k1k9bd,84,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable. You KNOW they'll most likely use you as a pillar for support and when you promise them that you'll never leave you give them false hope that crashes down on them twice as hard because of that promise. It's just a fucking cruel thing to do."
“Suicide is a solution to a temporary problem”,1680,jenqi9,240,"I hate that phrase, and I mark anyone who uses it as a fake who doesn’t actually give a shit other than to make themselves feel better for trying to “help”

As someone who is depressed suicide isn’t an option on the table for me yet,  but when it comes to it the only thing I’m gonna hear or read if someone says that to me is that it’s a “Solution”

Doesn’t change anything I just said though."
ever look back on your life and just wonder what happened to you?,1685,jrzoai,162,"i used to be so outgoing and carefree. i was content with myself because i didnt really have the capacity at that point to dislike myself at all - like, i didnt really know what that was, and i hadn't really lived much of life at that point to have developed anxiety and other issues. i didnt overanalyse and overthink. i actually used to walk about without this constant pit feeling in my stomach and without anxiety filling up my chest all the time. i genuinely used to be fine, and now im not so much. if i sit for a while and actually, genuinely think about how i physically and emotionally felt and think about my past perception of the world it is so different from how i feel now. and occasionally i'll get a fleeting feeling that reminds me of the contentedness i had when i was younger but it never stays. and it makes me so sad

edit: holy upvotes. thanks for the awards, and also sharing your feelings with me. it’s nice to know people are experiencing the same thing"
"""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger""... Just no.",1683,j7a7n6,139,"I hate this, I hear it here and there and my blood starts boiling every time.

No, everything in life that happens isnt somehow okay because ""oh you've learned from it.""

I'm not stronger because of my trauma, I am strong inspite of it. 

Me living with depression, going through different trauma, trying to kill myself twice and everything in between hasnt made me stronger, I would gladly not have gone through these things. 

This rant was sponsored by me being pissed.

Glad you are alive.

SIDENOTE: If you find comfort in those words then good for you, I don't mean to take away from that, its just my personal opinion."
"Does anyone else, when they're in a really depressed mood, feel like they're just acting sad to get attention?",1678,dvebhg,171,"I mean myself personally. Whenever I feel down I automatically start shaming myself by saying I'm only acting like this because I want someone else to feel bad for me. But I know that's not what I want, or at least I think it's not what I want. IDK. Does anyone else ever feel like this though?"
"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected.",1677,jlz1bh,149,"I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

Love used to be my hope, my north star. But in the words of ""Daughters"", LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. LOVE IS A DISGUSTING THING. And the reason it's disgusting is because it's the trick that continues to propagate this cursed existence."
Anyone else jealous of others happiness?,1676,da4nqk,132,"It could be over the smallest thing. Whenever I hear someone talk about hobbies or anything I am just envious of them. I wish I could enjoy things, I wish I could actually have the desire to do anything. It hurts. 

I absolutely hate when people ask me “So what are your hobbies?” “What did you do this weekend?” Shit like that. I have no answer because I just stay in my damn bed whenever I’m not at work. The other day someone asked me “Have you done anything interesting lately?” I just straight up said “No, I’m boring” 

I hate it because it makes people not want to be friends with me. And I get it, why would you want to be friends with someone like that? I don’t blame them. But goddamn I wish I wasn’t like this. Its not a choice, I wouldnt wish this on anyone. It’s literally the worst. A curse. Why couldn’t I just be normal and have a happy life"
I hate how people are automatically given the title attention whore if they don’t hide their depression well enough,1670,ljg65x,87,"At least for me I’ve hated how people say something like “oh that person isn’t actually depressed, it’s just for attention.”

I don’t understand the whole complex between depression and attention but I do know nothing feels worse than being in a depressive episode and having nobody to talk to. 

Maybe it stems from that.

All I want is my best friend back.
For us to have real conversations again.

Too bad I have self sabotaging tendencies but that’s a story for another day.

I just don’t want to feel completely alone anymore.

Update:
I never expected so many people to resonate with this. Thanks for all the awards and support on this post. It makes me feel slightly better that I’m not alone in this. I hope everyone had a good Valentine’s Day!"
Does anyone else just wanna start new,1669,f4re4h,252,I just want to move to a town where no one knows me and start fresh. I’m struggling so much
I just wish I could be asleep for the rest of my life,1662,b7994c,113,Probably sounds stupid but the only thing I look forward to everyday is laying in bed after doing nothing all day and just sleeping for 15 hours. I like dreaming. I wish I could sleep longer
"being called lazy, useless, and internet addict is a daily routine for me.",1664,fldr2o,135,"before, i had thought that if i told my parents about my depression they would be very supportive and instead feel that it is their fault that i turned out this way.

I was wrong.

My dad constantly asks me why am i always playing games all day, reading ""stupid, useless novels"", and refusing to go to school.

Mu grandma, keeps bothering me and lecturing me about how my phone will turn me blind because i look at it everyday.

My sister always scolds me for being so clumsy and disorderly with my stuff.

My mum is dealing with my dad's manic episode and my sister's upcoming national exam. She doesn't have time to deal with me.

They all know I am depressed. And they chose to ignore that fact and treat me like the depression is all ""in your head"".

I use my phone and games as an escapism. I need to distract myself so I won't constantly think abiut depression.

I am so tired of being called lazy. If I had some more energy to get up and do the stuff I like, I would do it. But everyday I feel like my body is deteriorating, and i am slowly sinking without anything to hold onto.

School's not any better. All of my classmates are nice but I just...can't handle the socializing. I hate being contacted. And I can't get anything into my head. I feel like my brain function is shutting down.

I used to be so good. Kind to others, excelled my studies, can connect with anyone.

I feel so tired of keeping up the mask. I can't carry on their expectation. Even if i want to, I can't handle it."
Don’t want to sleep because tomorrow will come faster,1659,fdnzub,94,"All I want to do is get in bed and sleep forever, but I can’t seem to bring myself to sleep because that will just bring tomorrow faster and that is worse than just lying here exhausted.  Does anyone else ever feel like that?  I’m new to this level of depression and am at a loss.  I really don’t know what I want to say or hear, but thank you for letting me rant and for listening."
People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,1657,8wzyys,205,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

I took my first shower alone.,1653,7mxjp5,124,Normally my mother or aunt is helping me shower since I'm terrified of showering and usually am forced to bathe .

Why don't you talk to us?,1657,7rrkf1,139,"My parents keep asking me this question.
Today I decided to talk. 

I told them about everything and I answered their questions.
After I had talked they told me: ""You don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.""

I didn't respond.

 They said: ""Oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!""
Then they left saying:""You can be such a dick when we try to talk to you.""

This is why I don't talk to you.

I have been self harm-free since February and I’m proud of my self for that bit it wasn’t easy.,1656,ceza6l,74,"I had resorted to self harming for a long time. Using knives were my poison. Right now I am struggling so much to not resort to it. I need help.

Edit: Wow. I didn’t expect this. Thank you everyone for all of these great tips and advice. And for those who are wondering I didn’t do anything and are still harm-free. I took a walk to get out of the funk or the lack for the better term. I might be getting into kickboxing.

I wish my mom hated me so I could kill myself without making anyone upset.,1637,cbvtds,163,I'm not fit for this world and wish I could leave without causing anyone pain.
I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.,1647,dip94b,145,"I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die. And that makes me hate myself even more, because I’m such a fucking coward. "
I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,1643,bmt4zr,168,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself. It feels like I have no one, except him, and I know what men are like after being cheated on before in past relationships."
If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved.,1637,k5tahy,66,"Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy. 

I bought my dad this precious cup that said grandpa on with foghorn leghorn fishing with the chicken hawk. I’ve lost any hope I had for the future and only the mug and I remain. Thanks for your kind words Internet neighbors I appreciate it.

Psychologist asked me what my inner child looks like. I drew this.,1643,k3xhe3,82,"Last therapy session I was explaining to my psychologist about my 'inner Child' (an expression which I hate but it made sense at the time). I described how it felt like she was trapped in a stone room with one high window which she can look out and hear other kids playing outside. She wants to leave the room but she knows it's safe in there and that makes her frightened to leave.

I drew [this](http://imgur.com/a/wIEFpRw) afterwards. I can't draw, but I hope someone else can relate to it.

I am not your therapist.,1637,j4vysl,96,"I honestly am getting sick of people always coming to me with their issues, even when I say I'm not doing well. I always listen and offer support, but nobody ever listens to me. If i'm not being ignored, the most all get it an ""lol same"". That's why I typically refuse to open up to people. I'm not asking for anyone to solve my issues, I just want some support. I'm tired of being the ""cute/funny/sweet/kind"" friend that everyone uses as a doormat and emotional punching bag. I am depressed as fuck, and I can't take it anymore. Yet, nobody listens. I have feelings too, you know. I'm not your emotional support dog, I'm a human being."

Is it alright if I vent? No one here cares...,1637,i975vd,156,"I’m a 50 year old man who is married and has raised two successful daughters. Sounds great, right? I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. 
My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk. She calls me lazy and stupid for not working when I really miss being productive. When my problems flare up and I can’t do things, she gets mad. She has now taken $900 that is mine. I’m at a loss. My wife was a wonderful woman. I don’t understand. There are days that I’m tempted to let the depression win and end my life because I don’t want to live like this. I’m done. I apologize for doing this here. I have nowhere else to do this. If you read this, God bless you and thank you. You treat me better than my family.


I never thought people would pay attention to this, but you did. Thank you. I fell asleep last night trying to reply to every one of you, but I see now that there’s a lot. Thank you so much. You’ve all given me some things to consider.

Thank you, each and every one of you. I never dreamed I would even get a reply. I just thought it would be like it is at home. Thank you. You’ve made a grown man cry. This means a lot."
Anyone else feel like falling asleep and not waking up.,1636,ctruu6,130,"In laying here about to sleep and every night I have the mantra in my head of that I hope I never wake up.

Anyone else?"
My parents told me to kill myself,1632,kzq5n5,138,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either. It just degenerated but I know they did not mean it, not even a word. When I came back they were terrified that I could have really killed myself, they were really happy to have me back with them."
Regular Check-In Post,1630,anh7tv,7287,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.  

Thanks to everyone for their courage in sharing their struggles, and their kindness in supporting others.  "
"You can't kill yourself, think of your family!",1624,kctnhy,147,"Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out."
I almost feel like I should’ve killed myself a long time ago and now I’m just living out a life that wasn’t meant to happen?,1624,ep4bw6,153,"I feel like the majority of my life so far was a movie of events just happening all leading up to the final end to the movie of me killing myself.  I would just die and I would never have to get to this part of life; it would just happen like that. but now I feel like I missed that chance and my movie is still going but the rest of the movie wasn’t planned out because it should’ve ended with my death so the story is just improvised, and now i feel even more lost and unmotivated than before. (because in all honestly I feel like I tried so hard with school and activities and work etc as one final push before i would kill myself but then I never went through with it and now I’ve given up trying on work and stuff) I don’t know whether others feel this way, but maybe in another alternate reality I did kill myself at the right time and that’s why I feel so wrong because I didn’t. who knows"
I don't know myself outside my mental illness,1624,honnfe,149,"Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. 

Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant.

EDIT:   God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. 
I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first. 
I hope we all recover and start feeling better soon, you all deserve to be okay. Thanks again to everyone."
Anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb?,1624,a3o9q0,193,"I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. 

EDIT: wow I didn't think this would get so much response! I made this post while I was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important! Now I feel like it had a purpose to help you guys feel less alone. I'm sorry you're all feeling the same way, I know how hard it is. Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences, it really made me feel less alone.

I truly don't think any of us are dumb or stupid or whatever you want to call it. We just have to recognise that it's this horrible disease doing it to us. I wish I could hug each one of you individually <3"
Could 1 person just read this - it's getting harder to pretend I'm okay and I dont know how to keep it up,1622,l9bq7t,166,"EDIT: Wow, thank you so much everybody I am so grateful, please please comment on people's posts that dont have any comments if you can. Hope you are all doing well or if not that things get better for you <3

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me."
I can't stand this fucking year,1613,j8yksu,98,I feel like I'm about to have a mental breakdown man.
I’m so disappointed in myself,1610,iqxdhj,80,"I suck at everything in my life even if I try to work my hardest. I pushed myself too hard in the past and now I’m too exhausted. Slowly rotting away on the inside. I’m not the person I once was. I have forgotten who that was anyway. All that’s left is a depressed, anxious mess."
"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?",1606,ki4i70,137," 

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?"
My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him.,1608,g2ojjp,109,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .  

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse  ,  I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and  I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough . 
You are worth it and you are strong and if you feel you are being invalidated and ignored please talk to someone , there will always be someone who cares about you're mental health ."
I'm only 19 but feel like I'm already in a mid life crisis.,1606,jvl099,127,"It's weird that I'm only 19 and feel like this. I started working straight out of high school 2 years ago. Im in retail and I feel so lonely and bored. No real life friends, 2-3 good online friends but I don't play with them often. I'm not friends with anyone at work. I see people hang out all the time and go to lunch together, I just sit by myself like usual. I just feel stuck, doing the same boring retail work daily, while having no friends or anything to look forward to my weekends. Even gaming is starting to feel dull, I browse my gaming library for hours and end up watching youtube and sleeping. I just feel stuck and trapped in this situation. I'm almost considering joining the army just to get out of my situation and re-start my life, meet new people and do something I would be proud of..."
I no longer believe in the myth that any challenge can be overcome with hard work alone.,1607,clhszv,104,"I used to believe that if someone tried hard enough they could do anything, I no longer believe that. I think hard work, wit, the help of others, and luck can allow someone to succeed in their endeavors but not hard work alone. This was quite a blow to me. I'm trying to replace this myth with something else at the moment."
I want to fucking die,1602,hm1xy5,136,Fucking. Holy fuck. Holy fucking shit. God take me early.
If I knew what I know now I would've just killed myself when I was 14,1604,ec1rel,145,"All this pain and suffering, hurting other people, wasting people's time, dragging myself through life just to be in the same place 8 years later. This fucking medicine doesn't help. Nothing helps. I'm just tired of it."
I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.,1604,e3g6bw,103,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain.   
Merry fucking Christmas to me."
I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.,1597,dgy2td,169,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

Edit: wow I didn’t expect this to get so many likes. My first post with over 1k likes! I’m happy to know that so many of you can relate with me in this way."
I don’t want to kill myself but sometimes I want to stop existing.,1597,deg7r3,145,"I wish there was an off switch that could be turned back on at will, ya know? Like a less permanent way to disappear. Just get off the grid for a while but then come back once I’m feeling better. Is it just me?"
I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,1596,ive8e5,134,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

&#x200B;

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

&#x200B;

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin"
I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,1598,len5sx,162,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

Thanks again you are great!

People fuck you up and they don't even realize,1585,m7l5k6,100," I was in a deep depressive episode when I was 12 , after my mom physically and mentally abused me in the bathroom, I still vividly remember how she pulled my hair and almost hit my head into the glass of the shower because of a minor inconvenience for her, for months after that I cried myself to sleep every single night. Eventually it stopped and I didn't make a big deal out of it. When I was 13 up until 16 the physical abuse happened at least every 6 months, she threw a slipper at me, beat me with a stick, slapped my face, and I would have bruises, along with all of that she would mentally fuck me up by yelling and calling me names that would make me want to die. 

Spanking a child when they do wrong is very common in our culture and I would hear stories of my cousins as well, having to walk out the hot street barefoot and spanked as a kid, but they would share about it normally like it was nothing. Some teachers at my school would fuck me up and make me feel like shit, they would target me and embarrass the fuck out of me, even if I looked chill with it, It made me want to disappear, I had lots of friends in school, but the way the teachers treated me were unacceptable because they as well would target my friends.

I once told my teacher I would run away from home if she ever told my mom what incident happened in school ( someone snitched about something ), and the teacher did tell my mom which really sucked because it would mean that my mom would physically and mentally abuse me again and my teacher didn't even know about it. I hated everyone, because they didn't know how shit was at home, when I wake up every morning my mom would instantly make me feel bad about myself, she would set expectations I know I would never achieve and other shit that would make me feel bad about myself, at one point I had the thought of killing myself, almost everyday. My friends didn't know I would feel left out when hanging out with them and so I would distract myself with drinking alcohol, which people thought was ""cool"" lol, didn't know drinking was such a cool thing for them. 

A big FUCK YOU, to everyone who thinks depression is some kind of joke. People would post shit on their instagram stories like ""mental health matters"" but they are the same people that judge and bring people down. It's a struggle having to keep up with my friends because it seems like their lives are perfect, it makes me not want to share my life struggles with them because it would just burden them. Another big FUCK YOU to teachers and other people who just interfere in your life without ever asking you how it might affect you.

People fuck you up and don't realise it. It's been a while since my mom physically abused me, but since lockdown happened, she has been more stressed and it has made me stress as well, mentally. All the physical and mental trauma she caused me has put a big hole in my life, she thinks I just forgot all about it and it didn't affect me, because I would hear her always say ""kids who are beat up as a kid would grow up not being affected by things like suicide and wanting to kill themselves, because they would already know the struggles of everything"" like honestly what kind of fucked up way of thinking is that, because the trauma she caused me affects everything in my life, my relationships with people, the way I act, and my self confidence, and yet she doesn't even know she caused all of it, heck she doesn't even know I have depression and anxiety. She would always preach to other parents that discipline is the most important....yeah it is.... but at what cost. She doesn't know she mostly caused my depression, how I am now is an effect of how she treated me back then. I love my friends but they don't try and help me at all even if they know what I'm going through and they treat me differently. I love my mom so much, but I wouldn't wish anyone to have a mom like her."
i wish i could restart my life,1580,f82dz1,116,become someone else and actually do something good with this life.. but its impossible. my only chance to be something is gone.
"Sometimes while enjoying time with my friends, all of a sudden I get very down and feel like crap. Over basically nothing. How do I get over this?",1580,c0wi1z,117,"It has happened more than once, usually I just try and get my mind off it and move on but sometimes it’s hard.

Scott Fitzgerald",1583,5rwkxj,78,"This quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression I've ever encountered in literature. One of the few times I'm actually startled by my own reflection. Just thought I'd share.

I'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too."
I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,1582,izn5op,173,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.


Edit, thanks for all the support guys, I’ve got another doctors appointment set up to see a new psychiatrist so that’s cool. 

Please stop upvoting and commenting haha, I never wanted to get this much attention and only wanted the 3 people that usually respond lol"
“you look depressed” thanks it’s the depression,1582,5uxuqb,98,
25 years old with absolutely no friends,1578,juifes,167,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her.

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider.

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday.

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

Idk what I'm trying to say with this post. Is there anyone out there who feels or experiences the same thing as me? How do you deal with it?

EDIT: I'm literally crying my eyes out with the support that's pouring in and the stories you all are sharing. I had no idea there are so many people who feel the same way as me. I'm at a loss for words seriously you guys are the best, thank you for making me feel like I'm not absolutely alone.

Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people,1581,82f2i9,145,I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better.

Every time you open up about depression people always feel the need to invalidate it,1573,c6tkci,127,"It happens every time. They say to reach out if you're struggling but as soon as you do everybody lets you down. People either make it a competition about who has it worse, or try and tell you that you don't have ""real"" depression. Another one is when people downplay your condition saying there are people who have it worse. For some reason it always happens with this illness. Can this stop already?"
My life in a nutshell;,1567,l8pmo2,128,"Having anxiety and depression is like being scared and tired at the same time. 
It's the fear of failure but no urge or will to be productive.
It's wanting friends but hate socializing.
It's wanting to be alone but not wanting to be lonely.
It's caring about everything just to abruptly care about nothing.
It's the feeling of feeling everything at once then feeling paralysingly numb.
It's wanting to get help, but subconsciously knowing it won't make a difference because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel, you are just tired of being in the tunnel."

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

How common is it for depressed people to lay in bed all day and not work out?,1572,hpi720,197,"I pretty much spent the majority of my early 20's doing exactly that. Eating fast food, laying in bed, and just getting by in life."

They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy. I don't know what to do and I feel hopeless.

The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”,1560,e0r6a9,193,"When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with. They disappear without warning and one day, it will hit you like a fucking dump truck in the chest that you have lost them forever."

edit: a couple people are reading the first few sentences as if it’s in the present tense. it’s not, it’s a prediction of what my life will be because of my lack of motivation and poor decisions.

My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP,1550,mg2a2c,123,"I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace. I'm not there quite yet, but baby steps are okay."
My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,1550,jc93qc,155,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start? 



Just needed to rant and vent a little. So if anyone actually read this far, thank you ❤️"
Does nostalgia bring up your depression?,1551,dtjg6g,184,"Whenever I think back to when I was younger and happy, I realise that my life is worse now and itl never be how it once was.

Does anyone else feel like there is a fog in their head they can't get rid of?,1546,bflw7u,119,"Maybe this has been talked about in other posts but i'm new to reddit and for once wanted to be transparent about my brain. 

Does anyone else feel like your head is a fog? or like your living a video game (controlling all the moments and decisions but not emotionally attached) The feeling of un-motivation, detachment and numbness has only gotten worse (i'm 21 now). I notice myself making poor decisions due to lack of caring and foresight (even though i know what the outcome will be) Sometimes even as far as not being able to think, as if my brain is just a static tv. 

(i say sometimes to all of this because i have moments of feeling 'normal', or even periods of time. But it always leads back to that same empty hole)

I feel like my brain is broken, like i've been missing out on how everyone else feels."

I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and..,1541,701r6k,108,"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."

This is not the life I imagined for myself,1540,bl099d,169,"I was bullied in elementary school, and I always used to tell myself that it's only temporary, that life will be good later, like in the movies.

I'm 27 now. No friends, no girlfriend, I lost my job recently due to a work injury... the life never really got better. I'm no longer being bullied by other kids, I'm being bullied by my own head. Every year is another wasteful, unfulfilling stepping-stone on the road to death.

"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.",1540,c3whma,71,"So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

It was the first time I'd felt happy in a long time, to be honest."
Can you be severely depressed and high functioning?,1540,ju89vy,215,"I keep taking online quizzes for depression and I keep getting severely depressed, but I think if I'm depressed I'm high functioning. I don't think most people would think I'm struggling. I seem like a happy person, do well in school, get stuff done, but it is so hard to do every day. I think the only thing that motivates me is my anxiety and guilt. So it is not like I get things done because I'm feeling any optimism about life or a will to live

EDIT: reading everyone's comments and want to say thank you so much. It is really validating to hear from so many people who relate, and I hope we all are able to find peace in life. I wish I could respond to everyone, but it's hard when some of this stuff is so relatable or emotional to read. Just know I appreciate all of it"
I plan to kill myself tonight with a plastic bag (suffocation),1538,kdpiwa,394,"I'm 14
my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel. She knows that I'm deppressed and won't let me see a therapist. I hope that she can stop my brother from having the same fate as me. I'm sorry."

It’s kinda like yeah support from people is nice but you just feel like you should just keep distance. 
I do start feeling guilty every time I text my friends I’m okay and just chilling when they genuinely ask me if I’m alright. I just want to hide everything from my friends."
Suicide is comforting,1531,hl4md7,131,"The feeling that you get when you know that there will be an end to end kills my sadness and makes me completely calm. It sadly gives me hope so it’s the only thing that’s keeping me going, knowing that I can end it completely."
I hate it when people criticize me for not doing enough because of my depression. I am literally trying my hardest. This is my best right now. Stop comparing me to someone with perfect brain chemistry. I'm doing all I can. This is going to have to be enough for you because it's barely enough for me.,1533,5rphn9,110,
Does anyone else actually want to talk about your depression with a loved one but then convince yourself that you’re just an attention seeking piece of shit that doesn’t actually have depression at all?,1532,9t8v96,104,"Even despite an official diagnosis, I constantly think, anytime I want to share my thoughts, that I’m just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones. It makes me feel guilty the moment I open my mouth to talk about how I’m feeling. Anyone else?

It makes it worse that every time I talk to my partner about it, she always twists it into some underlying meaning that I don’t want to be with her. And I get livid that she’s made it about her. Maybe I am just selfish and attention-seeking. "
Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,1527,elycos,163,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely. Nowadays I struggle to even read sometimes, I just don;t have the strength, but I try.

I do say though writing this was therapeutic because I am severely overwhelmed saying this but thanks for reading."
do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive,1525,8k2qly,106,and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol
I ruined my own life by being an overwhelmingly anxious idiot.,1528,ira8be,57,"Can't go into details too much for privacy sake but I'm really falling apart. My relationship, my friendships, my happiness, all gone. All because I acted upon my own anxieties and panicked. 

I wish I had listened to what people told me to do, maybe my life wouldn't be all broken. 

I want to cry everyday. I want to die everyday. Everyday is a battle between wanting to be a better man for myself and those around me and wanting to die. 

I don't know how much longer I can take this, but I hope I'm still here, for my daughter's sake.

EDIT: this is wild. didn't think this would get a lot of attention. i posted this as a means of putting it out there instead of bottling it in, and i'm glad a lot of people resonated with this. 

everything sucks, but my daughter is the only thing that's keeping me going. i hope everyone has that one thing that motivates them to keep going. much love."
Casually Suicidal,1528,g99heb,127,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

For all the comments, I'm sorry I can't reply to them all but I will try to when I get round to it. But I want to say this now for anyone who will be reading in the future, please feel free to pm me. I'll always reply. Didn't realise this would blow up, but it is nice to know people feel the same way. I hope you find some sort of comfort in that as I do. Stay safe.

The mistakes i made. It sucks. I've been through waves of depression but but deep down i've always thought maybe things will turn out but this is the first time i feel like that little dying ember inside me is completely burnt out."

I'm homeless now,1511,k37pwd,115,"Because I ran away from abusive parents. Never thought I'd actually do it but here I am. I don't want to return. There it's pure hell. It's agonizing to live there. Now I am outside and I will live on the streets. My number one fear became alive. It's incredible how fears and the thing you don't want most to happen actually happen. Life is hell. Life is torture. I don't know what the fuck i will do from now on. Guess I'll be what I feared to be the most. That's it.

EDIT: I took the decision on impulse and I realized that it's impossible to do this on this time of the year. I'm too weak so I gave up. I'll try to calculate my possibilities and think through how I can leave this cursed house. I already regret giving up but what can I do. If I can't find any shelter to get away from here I will try to apply for uni dorm in the next semester. Unfortunately, the country I live in is shit and has little to no possibilities for those in disadvantaged situations. Abuse is considered normal here.

Thank you everyone for the support and advices, it means a lot to me.

EDIT 2: I'm from Romania."
It sucks that I have to pay the price for the abuse caused to me,1516,lo67kq,95,"It's so fucked up. Despite enduring abuse from my home environment, and relentless bullying at school I'm the one who has to pay the price. I'm the one who has to pay for the therapy sessions, I'm the one who had to move out and pay for the cost of living at age 17.   


It's so fucked up. Despite this, people expect me to just ""get on with life"". I'm treated as if ""Yeah we all have shit going on, just get on with it"". They don't realise how hard it is for me to get through a week doing basic activities, let alone finish getting a degree.   


Basic tasks like walking in the city and hearing people laugh is stressful for me. I automatically assume they're laughing at me. I'll be coming home on the bus and feel like people around me are judging my appearance. Certain things will cause me to break down and cry due to previous trauma. Yet no one fucking acknowledges it.   


Living with trauma is like going on a hike where you have a 30kg weight strapped to your back whereas everyone else has a 5kg weight strapped to their back with a head start. Life is significantly harder yet others don't see it.   


They'll oversimplify it. ""No one cares, just stop worrying"". When you go through years of bullying, you get conditioned that people in fact absolutely do care.  Yet I'm treated as if I'm the crazy one."
Depression for me is the constant feeling that everyone else is better off without me.,1513,cr3476,123,"Anyone else feel the same way?

My brain needs to be occupied constantly but also can’t focus.,1507,h9pcpp,128,I am struggling so hard with being able to focus but when I sit to try and focus my brain rolls out all these horrible thoughts and I just want to evaporate

Taking care of the most basic things when your depressed is difficult,1506,e4wpyx,132,"Like washing, eating, staying on schedule, and so on.. It just doesn't matter. I think I could go on not washing for a month if my guilty conscience didn't tell me to at least act like a human being."

"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length",1502,kz4j2r,152,"Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive"
I drew a comic about my experience with depression.,1498,3n5g8x,104,"Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys."
I wish I was never born. Life is a load of fucking bullshit.,1493,j9mls7,129,"I hate being alive. I fucking hate it. I'm miserable all the fucking time and no matter how hard I try to make things better for myself it never fucking works. I'm just so tired of everything and I'm sick of trying my best when I know it's all going to amount to nothing. There's no point in anything, no point in finding friends, no point in falling in love and getting married. Why does being happy even matter if we're all just going to fucking die anyway?"
Not suicidal but wouldn't be mad if I died,1494,iewx3e,99,"As I grew older there were more negatives than positives and there were more unbearable than bearable days. 

So much so that I am not affirmatively suicidal but if I died through no action of my own, I would feel relieved. Life is tiring, plagued with problems. Hardly any ups and we are confirmed many downs. There's nothing much left to hold on to. 

Is this a problem or something a lot of us have in common?

Edit : I deleted all social media apps from my phone the day I posted this, So I am now logging in to many comments from people feeling the same way. I've not found a way to tackle this problem, I've just simply lost the will to live and there's no quick solution to finding meaning in a life. However, I do hope I'll be able to refocus and make this life purposeful. I hope the same for you too, if you've read the original post and feel the same. Thanks for the support."
Does anyone else wake up feeling fine for about 5 minutes before anxiety and depression take over?,1491,e5fqrd,113,"Most mornings I wake up feeling absolutely mentally content, then within about 5 minutes all the shit just hits me.

A mixture of anxiety and depression.

I feel that cozy feeling mentally when I wake up but it dissapears. I used to feel like that inside all day long."
I've made myself bitter and cynical to shield myself from the fact that I'm terribly lonely and jealous of other people getting to experience love and friendship,1486,mi48yo,98,"Yeah, that's basically what it boils down to.

That and I believe I am a horrible person who is unworthy of those things and I wouldn't even know how to be a real friend or lover anyway because I am so monumentally screwed in the head.

So I tell myself ""Oh, those people? They're not really friends. They don't really love each other that much. It's just for show. When there's no one recording, they hate each other just as much as everybody does"".

But in my heart of hearts, I know the truth. It's not them. It's me."
A friend told my teacher that I want to kill myself. Now I'm in an even bigger mess,1492,e1nyjf,169,"So that happened... I had a really bad day and told my friend that I basically have no reason to live and that I want to kill myself. She told another friend, and she said it to my teacher. 

The teacher immediately called my parents. Now they're mad at me for everything. My friends are mad at me. My teacher is mad at me. Everything has gone to shit...

I just cannot say what I'm thinking, because it always hurts someone. I won't be able to hold it in for long. Guess this might be my last week on this world. I hope that without me everyone will finally be able to get some rest"

I know one day i will kill myself,1481,kmskz3,173,"One day i just know i will do it. I don’t quite know when because i still hold on to the tiniest bit of hope that things will get better. But i feel so worn down and broken, after giving my all to others and emotional trauma from my childhood I don’t have much energy or will to go on. The dark thoughts creep up on me everyday, and i find myself saying “not yet” rather than not ever."
Mom only takes my depression seriously when I mention suicide.,1479,ijb81s,92,"99% of the time when I don’t mention suicide? It’s just a phase and I need a “reality check”. Thanks mom.

Edit: I see some of the comments thinking I’m a teenager going through a “phase” and I’d like to clarify that I’m 24 and I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety. I have a therapist, am on antidepressants and my mom is a narcissist. Even with the help I have, it gets hard at times and I vent.

Thank you for the well wishes, everyone. I hope we can get through this together."
the only reason i haven’t killed myself is that i don’t want people going through my stuff,1477,g21qph,85,"i feel so stupid for this. i absolutely HATE people looking through my things and belongings, and i know that when i die it will be done. so i haven’t killed myself. my mom has already gone through my shit a few times so i don’t know why it even matters now. i just want to disappear and that be it. 

i hope this makes sense oof

edit: thank you all so much for your kind responses, it’s great knowing i’m not alone in this. there a LOT more comments than i thought so i’m gonna answer the rest tomorrow. <3"
Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever,1477,lq6oee,112,"I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will.

I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me.

And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them.

But, it helped so much. Honestly.

Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care.

To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life.

I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone.

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

Probably wasn’t going to go through with it, but I really genuinely wanted to be dead because life had just dealt me one too many blows and I couldn’t stand up anymore.

Thank you stranger. Now I’m gonna go binge movies and work."
I tried to hang myself yesterday and they're talking about getting me into school in two days. F 13,1479,f8q6pt,171,"I am depression. The person I used to be is gone, there is no going back from this.
I'm just sat In the hospital while my mum speaks to cahms, trying to hide my neck from all the other patients. I'm desperate to leave the hospital and get home but I know I'm gonna try again eventually.

I've been on fluoxetine (prozac) for three months and everything is still getting worse. 

I just wish so much that the knot held, life just isnt for some people."
I had a friend over for the first time in two years today,1472,ehg01s,71,"She literally left five minutes ago, I don't know why but I feel happy, I feel proud of myself. A few weeks ago I was so crippled by social anxiety that I couldn't even bear to try and text anyone but now, I worked up the courage to ask an old friend to hang out and she said yes. She got to my house at 2 pm and left at 9:30 pm, that's like 7 whole hours!  I can't believe I did it. I had fun and she said she had fun too. She even hugged me when she left, nobody's hugged me other than my parents in two years. My mom cried because she was proud of me and I feel like crying too. We talked about the usual stuff (school, boys, makeup, memes, etc.) and for one of the first times, I felt like a normal teenage girl doing something that normal teenage girls do. 

For today, I wasn't the girl that was locked in the psych ward for a while, I wasn't the girl who lost everything when I was 13, I wasn't the freak who never talks at school, I was me. I just acted like myself and it worked? I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness right now, happy that I did it, sad that it's over. Where do I go from here? I have a friend now, that's good right? 

I feel a little bit proud of myself, is that weird? I just kinda feel good that I did it. I know that this post will get lost in this sub and probably nobody will see it but I just want somebody to know what I did today. I feel at peace. I just got a new fantasy romance book (my favorite kind of book) from the library, I have my comfort plush next to me for support (along with bulbasaur and pikachu plushies i got for christmas 😀) and I feel *peaceful* for once. I think i'm going to read my new book now, I feel like maybe I deserve it. Maybe I really do..

EDIT: wow haha, this kinda blew up overnight! Just saw this now as i've been spending almost all of today reading that book, I can't put it down! only a few more chapters left to go lol. I'm not really sure how awards work on reddit, but I know you're supposed to say ""thanks for the gold, kind stranger"" so thanks for the gold, kind stranger! I'll do my best to respond to all of these comments, you guys are the best, and seeing all of your kind words really warms my heart so much <3


POINTLESS EDIT #2: woah, I've cried because of some of your comments! (don't worry, all happy tears) it means a lot. As for the book goes, I loved it and just finished it a few minutes ago, i'm going to the library in a few more minutes to get the second one, it's called ""Caraval"" for those who care. I guess this has a meaning because when I feel especially depressed, I want to get swept away into a fantasy world just like that book does, I really recommend it, it uplifted me (no this isn't an ad for the book i just really love reading)"
I. Really. Hate. How. It. Come. And. Goes. In. Waves.,1472,8cewkh,109,"At one time, I feel all right.

I hope everyone here escapes depression eventually 💞,1474,l91xaw,42,Ive stopped talking to a lot of people last year and i really dont feel ok. Today i just havent moved or showered and my mood is just so low today. Usually im ok but today i keep thinking of how many ppl arent alone and have lots of relationships and date a lot. And for like 6 years ive done so little interacting and ive had so few lovers basically all of 2019 and 2020 ive been alone and my birthday is coming up and valentines day and it just makes me feel so alone every year. I feel like im missing out and cant relate to others as easily. Ive got family here but im just so alone and sad. Anyways i just had to vent i really hope everyone here feels joy soon and we can all stop feeling so depressed. 😟
"No, i dont want attention. I just want my pain to be acknowledged.",1471,kr5uvu,72,"Pretty much it. i dont want to bother anyone with it, but its all building up inside me. Idk if i can take this alone, but its hard to tell anyone because it just ruins everything.

Edit: thank you everyone for making me feel accepted for who i am. I care about you all. Whatever you’re going through, please know that you’re not alone. Stay safe friends"
I will never understand how people can live and be happy,1460,jm9w19,121,"Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me. No meds, psychiatrist, psychologist, life habit, nothing."
does anyone else actually WANT to do something productive but you have no energy because you are so tired and lazy and unmotivated that you can't bring yourself to do it?,1464,5apruo,167,and then you just stay in bed and browse Reddit and pointless crap the whole day and then feel guilty for procrastinating. But then you promise yourself to do it tomorrow or some other day and it happens again and the cycle just keeps repeating and you just keep feeling guilty again and again
"""Everyone is going through the same thing, don't worry""",1461,lv7vng,105,"Yes, I know that. And yes, I know that somehow I can't handle it like the others do. I know I'm really weak. Thank you for reminding me."
Do you guys get quickly tired when talking to people?,1460,kyj2zr,74,"I have very little energy for the day by default, but I found that talking with someone quickly drains me and depletes whatever energy i do have. After just a little while i feel like I can barely talk anymore, i feel literally like I'm losing air and then i basically have to force myself to speak. Oh well."
Can't start anything,1461,lt64ob,110,"I'll pick up my bass guitar. Play a few notes. Put it down.

I'll think about what video game I want to play. Play a few minutes. Lose interest.

I'll watch Youtube videos for game development. Get overwhelmed. Quit.

I'll listen to music and get inspired to do something and then in a few minutes lose that inspiration.

I'll have hope for my future, think of a reason why it won't work out, and go back to being hopeless.

I'll reach out to someone on reddit and then realize what's the point of telling my life story all over again to some stranger and then go back to bottling up my despair.

This has been my life the past few days."
I just want a hug so badly it hurts,1462,f48ct8,167,"I've never hugged anyone before...

I just want to know what the warmth of another person feels like...I'm so tired of being alone.

I'm so pathetic, I'm laying here trying to sleep and i just can't stop crying like a dumbass, hugging a blanket."
Anyone else feel like they just aren’t cut out for life?,1455,edvvhg,166,"Ever since leaving school and entering “the real world”, I have realised I’m just not cut out for it and honestly I wish I was never born.

I’m in my mid 20s now and the thought of possibly living another 50+ years until I die of old age, terrifies me. 50+ years of anxiety, dread and self-hatred...what kind of life is that?"
Anybody feel like this ?,1462,gosn41,131,Does anybody feel like they have to kill themselves to prove to people that they ACTUALLY have depression and they aren’t crying out for attention ?
I ruined my own life,1455,hfexm2,98,"It’s no ones fault but my own. I pushed people away and now I have no friends, I don’t even know how to socialize anymore. I’m too anxious to even try and make friends. But at the same time I don’t want any friends. I like being a loner. But I know that I’m never gonna be happy because there’s no one to love me and I certainly don’t love myself. I don’t even know where it went wrong years back, but I wish I could beat the fuck out of my younger self for socially withdrawing myself because I’ll never recover."
I had a shower and brushed my teeth for the first time in 2 weeks today.,1453,73t0n5,129,"There was more blood than toothpaste in my mouth by the end but hopefully I can keep doing it. The pain felt good.

edit: whoah that blew up..."
Isn’t it weird to explain that you’d rather feel sadness than nothing at all ?,1452,h189bq,149,"It’s so weird that feeling nothing is the new normal for many , I used to think people were being super dramatic but that is really what it feels like . I think when I feel “ better “ , it’s not really like happiness , it’s more so that empty feeling that could pass for happiness / normality . I keep trying to force tears just to feel something ( as dramatic as it sounds ) , but nothing happens, I can never cry naturally , I have to force myself , and the minute I stop focusing on it , the tears dry up oops  . I feel isolated from everyone - like I can see my family / friends interacting but there’s like this chain keeping me rooted in place if that makes sense ? All communication is too much effort ? Let alone movement . The feeling of nothingness is almost safer and more comfortable and reliable ? I kinda prefer it than being happy I guess . Happy makes me feel vulnerable or uncomfortable . Everything good and bad in life comes from feelings ."
"I'm only living to see if I'll be happy one day, but I'm impatient.",1447,f5cc8g,116,"I'm sad most of the time, and when I'm not, I'm empty. I've put into motion plans that I think will make me happy again, but they'll take years, and I'm tired of waiting. How do I withstand my life until it's all better?"
Doesn't it fucking suck how you can be laughing and enjoying something but at the same time remain unbelievably sad the whole time.,1446,6n6mgk,75,I feel like nothing makes me happy; even when I'm laughing and enjoying something like a movie or some shit I still just feel incredibly upset and depressed. Sometimes I actually feel worse.
“JuSt Go tO ThErApY”,1447,jaf1im,229,"I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

/rant

Tldr: therapy isn’t easy to get into and isn’t cheap. “Go to therapy” is not a solution many people can take."
I can't relate to people who've never been depressed.,1443,lzkryv,73,Every estimate shows over half of adults never experience depression. Depression is all I've known for a long time.
I feel like I can’t connect with people anymore.,1440,i6o9s1,105,"I spent so much time on my own, scared to trust people and just doing my thing. Whenever I hang out with people, I get sick of socializing super quickly like a shitty battery running out. I go on dates with guys who are very into me but I’m never into them. I never know what to say. I would rather stare at a wall for an hour than try to carry a convo with a stranger. Then I feel shitty about myself for letting them down. It’s not like I’d make a decent girlfriend anyway. 

Feels like I’ll never meet someone I will like spending time with. I just wanna go home and do stuff alone. I always thought I didn’t have friends cause I hate myself but I think I hate other people even more.


Edit: wow this blew up. I never expected that so many people felt the same. I feel a little bit less alone now. I also feel sad for all of you knowing we’re all going through the same pain <3"
I feel beyond suicidal,1441,fnkceg,99,"Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

Edit: Wow 1.3k upvotes and an award? This is the first post I've ever made here on this sub and you've all made me feel really welcome so thank you very much. I'm glad so many people get it. I knew I wasn't the only one out there who felt like this but to see the amount of traction this got and just how many people understood this makes me feel so much less alone. I wish I could thank each one of you individually! Thanks for being there Reddit. <3"
My mom was killed two weeks ago.. I don't know what to do,1440,bfcpxb,91,My dad died when I was 11 and mom died two weeks ago from an incident with a neighbor. We buried her yesterday. Its easter weekend. My girlfriend wants to go to a party but I just want to chill. I don't know if its a good idea to go or not. Shes understanding and will stay home with me. I just think its too soon to be around a party group. Also I'm 28 so I don't have a lot of life experience.
"Does anybody else feel so calm during winter? Fuzzy socks, soft blankets, hot drinks, laying in ur bed....I feel like I almost have a spiritual connection w cold weather. My dream is to move to a small town and just escape from big cities and stress that's going on in them.",1443,73esd0,140,
"I hate when people say ""life will get better""",1434,fz98lj,161,"I want life to BE better not to GET better, I want it ""better"" NOW, I don't want to wait for fate. I'm done waiting.

 besides the future is uncertain, it could very well get better or it could get even worse, and most of the times it may be out of your reach."
am I the worst human being in the world for secretly hoping the coronavirus would take my mum so that I can kill myself without affecting anyone too dear to me?,1437,fltp8a,193,"it's such a selfish selfish thought and Im trash for even thinking it.
obviously I do not want my mum to suffer through it OR for her life to be taken, but right now she's the only reason I'm still alive and I feel so trapped, im just wishing for any way out now

Alone and Abandoned on my birthday,1437,cv7dqu,508,"It's my 17th birthday today and first of all none of my friends except 3 wished me. At home my stupid dad was to drunk to acknowledge me and I am sitting here on my birthday in tears, feeling alone.

\*Edit: Thanks a lot for all the nice comments, it is crazy how people on the interent can be so kind and it has meant a lot

\*Another Edit: It is the day after my birthday and I woke up to like +300 messeges. Holy crap thanks a lot I don't think you understand how much it has cheered me up! I will make sure to reply to everyone, but I don't want to rush it, but from the bottom of my heart....Thank you."
I wish I could re-do my teenage years without my anxiety and depression,1432,92y0ub,129,"And in a different time period, prior to the internet being a thing. 70s or 80s maybe. I spent my entire childhood locked away in my room with a glowing blue screen."
i feel like depression has made me less smart,1427,7wmmpd,138,"i dont think about much anymore. the things i do think about are unimportant.

because of this, i dont have anything intelligent to say. im not funny or clever or smart. i probably seem very stupid and shallow and boring and i dont like this.

i wish i had the motivation to find things interesting and not be so one-dimensional and dull."
Is it wierd that i have imaginary friends at the age of 16 (almost 17) ... i feel like the ultimate loser,1433,jygm7t,205,"16f ... cant manage to make friends and get overwhelmed with online friends :(.

Well i have this teddybear which is a lil bit taller than me and i pretend that he is my imaginary friend (called thao btw... i dunno why) so i watch YouTube videos with him,  talk to him when i'm sad/suicidal and so on . Whenever i'm in school, downtown ... whenerver i'm not at home HE is still there and before this corona shit i slept smiling randomly when i had a conversation with him (in my head of course) and those looks (omfg the looks) other people gave me were something else. I havent even told this my close online friends nor my psychiartists because i'm so scared that they will laugh at me. 

I cant even blame anyone for laughing at me because wtf i'm 16 and while others go to the mall with their friend group i either get panic attacks or ho there with a person that only exists in my head.



Besides thao i take videogame charaters as my friends i really really like and kinda adore lol... am i the only one ?"
memory loss from depression,1422,fbi7gc,155,"so recently my depression has hit a low point as I am in the middle of switching my meds since i saw a psychiatrist this week and she diagnosed me with severe depression and anxiety and is worried about me. anywho, my memory has been BAD. like, I cant remember what I am doing sometimes or past 20 minutes of anything someone tells me. can anyone else relate? right now, i dont know if its derealization but I just dont feel present. I feel like i am alive but not here, i cant remember anything and it is driving me crazy. I would rather be sad, unmotivated, and depressed rather than suffering from memory loss."
It’s crazy to me that there are people out there who have never been depressed or thought about killing themselves,1424,as55w2,114,I guess I’ve just been living like this so long it’s hard to believe there are people out there who have never felt this way at all
"I did it guys! Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I cleaned my house!",1422,bkn0zs,75,"I'm clinically depressed, and have been on Wellbutrin for about 4 months now. It certainly evened me out a bit as I'm not as mopey, but when I get home I don't want to do anything but either sleep, or play video games. 

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine.

I actually feel like I can invite someone over for game night or something, as a lot of my coworkers find it weird that I never want to do anything at my house.

E: wow, I did not anticipate the overwhelming support. thanks gals/guys for letting me know that I'm not alone. Also, obligatory thanks for the gold kind Sir/Ma'am

E2: ayy, y'all threw me in the 100k karma territory, thanks pals. *proceeds to get down voted to hell*"
"Just deleted a suicide note I wrote two years ago. I don't recognise the person in it, it's not me anymore :)",1421,4chu7c,44,"I was sorting out my documents on my laptop and found this file, I wrote it a couple of years ago and reading it now makes me realise how far I've come. Had counselling since then and so much exercise, socialising and growing. Made me feel a lot better about the current funk i've just worked through.

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014."
"Does anyone else feel like they want to die, but don’t actually want to kill themselves",1421,8emb6y,171,I’ve been having this feeling for months now and it’s been making me feel even more depressed
I wish suicide wasn’t harmful to other people.,1417,gprxmi,120,"If I could take my life, and know that it would 100% inconsequential to others, I think the decision would be easy. If it was just lights out for me and no one else is hurt or lives disrupted at all, I would do it right now."
"Do you ever just lie in bed, thinking how different your life COULD be and imagining all the possibilities instead of actually going out there and doing them?",1416,7v11w3,106,I do. I know it's a lot easier than getting stuff done and I wouldn't be able to get half the stuff I want done done anyways.
phrases im tired of hearing,1410,hp11z8,181,"""it gets better"" 

for fleeting moments at best

""you are loved""

by who lmao? you, who doesn't even know my name? a stalker? 

""temporary problem""

well i guess this is techinally correct. no one lives forever

""theres so much to live for""

well maybe for you thats true, but for me who has  lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable 

""what about your loved ones!""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. 

""god-""

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. 

""choose to be happy""

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

""go to therapy""

sure, you paying?


seriously, i understand (and am thankful for even if it doesnt seem it) the sentiment behind some of these but they're basically all built on assumptions or plain old ignorance. also sorry if this type of post is overdone i needed to rant"
Why does depression and anxiety make it so fucking hard to tell if people actually like you?,1412,enfyh1,75,Seriously- I can’t tell even if I’ve known them forever. Do they like me? Or are they just too nice to tell me how much they don’t. Today is a bad day and I’m just obsessing over everything.
Does anyone else just think “kill yourself” every time you do something wrong?,1412,co91bi,107,I make a lot of mistakes and am very awkward so I end up thinking the words “kill yourself” dozens of times a day. It’s like a reflex at this point. I’m not actually going to kill myself but it’s like some subconscious desire bubbling up from deep down. I’m afraid I’ll start saying it out loud or something
"I wish to be dead, not to die.",1407,g3df9g,76,"This statement makes no sense to someone who doesn't suffer from depression. I wish I was never born. I wish that this would all end. But I can't bring my self to end it. I want to not exist, but for some reason dying scares me. Not death whatever lies beyond I will deal with when I get there, but it's the step between suffering and non existence that scares me."
"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?",1411,fekv9y,79,"First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.  What do you want to hear as the interviewer when you ask that question?  That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

Afterthought:  can't help but laugh that when driveling on in this post I look up at the browser tab and it says 'Submit to depression'  

 Haha, fuckin' A."
I have no passion for anything anymore,1409,ddyoc0,156,"I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I dread waking up and I can’t wait to go home to sleep just so I don’t have to think anymore. I use to have more friends and go out all the time but now all I do is work, see my boyfriend, study and maybe see my friends once a week. My life is so meaningless I feel as if it isint going anywhere and I just feel so empty inside. I use to enjoy activities I use to be around everyone and be happy now whatever I do I can’t enjoy . I don’t know how to get out of this sometimes I can sit for hours just staring at a wall I am so dead inside"
I really miss feeling joy and euphoria,1412,d86ioa,103,"I wish I still felt that full-body joy/euphoria like I did as a kid. Waking up on Christmas morning, making eye contact with a boy I had a crush on during class, playing video games with my dad and winning the level. Everything feels so dulled and flat now, it makes me wonder what the point is. I’m spending money to go on holiday to beautiful places and barely enjoying it. The closest I get to joy is when I’m shitfaced drunk. 

Antidepressants sorta help but I don’t want to be taking them forever, plus the side effects are crappy. I guess I will have to settle for experiencing that childlike wonder and joy through my son, watching him do things for the first time.

Edit: please stop suggesting drugs"
I think my life is destined to end in suicide,1406,k67uzs,108,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.


Edit: Honestly wow. I wrote this on like half brainpower before going to sleep just getting those thoughts that have plagued me recently out. I didn't think it would get this kind of response, it was a nice suprise to wake up to since I really didn't believe there was anyone that cared anymore. I especially didn't know that so many could relate to these kinds of thoughts. This is the dark side of depression that people don't want to talk about. All I can say is that I'm still here for now fighting on another day."
"How am I suppose to live, when I don’t wanna work? Or don’t even enjoy anything? I wanna just kill myself everyday but I can’t even do that.",1403,j1ceeu,144,"I feel trapped, I don’t know what to anymore.

Only thing I can think of lately is just killing myself, it’s all what’s on my mind nowadays.

I honestly try to get out and get a job, but it’s impossible to get a job when you don’t even wanna work lol and I get interviews but never get a call back. 

I try to go out and have fun and meet new people but I never even have fun or I rather just be at home doing nothing.

I just feel like I’m fucked in the head or something, like why don’t I enjoy anything?? Life just feels so plain no matter what and pointless."
Sharing something I’m proud of for a chance,1409,c33tns,94,"The past two weeks I have cooked almost daily instead of eating fast food, I’ve kept my house clean, showered regularly, and I’ve done all of my work for Grad school (even some of it way ahead of time). I usually don’t say I’m proud of myself but I think I need to say it today."
Anyone just want to take a break from life and just go to a park on a summer night and just look at the stars alone?,1405,7qwvjs,105,"That's all I want. I wanna go to a park, lay on the grass by the lake and look at the stars, alone. Life is so beautiful, just wish I wasn't apart or this society "
"while i don't want to kill myself, if a car ran me over on accident tomorrow i would not complain",1404,hfv39a,133,"anyone else? i feel like i can't really ""justify"" my suicide since the burden of proof is on me but the sentiment still stays"
Does anyone else feel their life won't go anywhere?,1403,dpadbk,160,It's the same thing over and over. I'm always physically sick and emotionally drained and I've gone through a lot since childhood. I'm just tired and hope for future seems bleak.
Nobody wants to deal with negative people,1400,cjo7ts,159,"You really have to be careful with what you say around coworkers, friends, and family. If you’re not always a ray of sunshine, you become the negative, depressed person who is no fun to be around. At the end of the day, no one really gives a shit about what you’re dealing with. If you’re not being positive and smiling, no matter the reason, they have a problem with you.

I wish there wasn’t a constant pressure to be happy and outgoing. It is exhausting to hear comments about your demeanor."
My suicide note,1406,izxse1,204,"Hi reddit.
This will probably be my suicide note so please read.

I've been depressed for the last 7 years and whenever I tell anyone they just tell me to man up I don't think they want me anymore and I want to escape this nightmare of a life and my mom has been really cold towards me lately and I feel she hates me and my dad has been working abroad for 5 years so I don't see him often, so this is goodbye reddit

And whoever read this, thanks

Edit :for everyone who is being so kind thanks for all the comments And I just wanted to let you know that I'm trying to hold on the best I can"
What if I don’t have depression and I’m just a lazy worthless useless human being who does absolutely nothing,1402,f5nbbz,193,I’m just using resources undeservingly that should be reserved for more worthy people tbh.
Depression has made me so stupid,1396,axypnl,98,"I can’t concentrate, I don’t focus, I miss the picture of concepts. Overall I’m just disengaged and demoralized. I live the same repetitive day over and over. Dropped out of school for the 4th time, can’t keep jobs, lose passion. I’m comically miserable. I don’t even feel like a real human anymore. I used to be articulate blah blah but nope. At this point I just drink a gallon of water and eat cereal that’s next to me until I have to move. No wonder my brain is rotting. Hell I can’t even get through reading paragraphs on Reddit. I generally don’t engage in anything bc it all feels like a chore in lots of regards. Same fights"
"Two days ago I was feeling amazing, the best I ever have and now I am miserable and want to die. Wtf brain.",1397,c8anzi,143,"The last few days I felt on top of the world, had boundless energy, felt my depression was completely cured. Was so happy, life was so beautiful, every thing was so beautiful. I was planning days out, chatting to people more than I ever do, making jokes, laughing. Felt a deep sense of calm and connection with the universe. 
Now I'm lying in bed tired and miserable because I painted my shed door and made a mess of it so I'm obviously a worthless human being. The idea of following through with any of those plans I made fills me with dread. 

I wish the happiness would actually last."
Does anyone else feel like they either can't or are afraid to speak up about their feelings because there are many people that have it worse and you feel like you shouldn't complain?,1392,b52zri,120,I often tell myself this and it really keeps me from opening up to others about how I feel when I'm upset.
I feel like a suicide attempt is the only way to make people care.,1395,iarsbg,91,"I live in a country where depression isn’t taken too seriously. People just think I’m “going through a hard time” or “feeling down.” They don’t understand just how serious the circumstances are. Just to clarify, I don’t want to commit suicide (though I have seriously considered it). However, I do think that if I made a suicide attempt, then people’s perspectives would change. I know it’s an irrational way of thinking, but I’m getting to a point where I’m running out of options.

Edit: Did not expect this to blow up... Thank you to everyone who gave their advice/support. I just want to update that I am currently seeking out professional help."

I really don't want to die. I actually really like life. I just don't like my life.,1391,6kfdyy,96,"I think the world is beautiful. There are so many amazing things to see and do, and seemingly countless possibilities, too many for a single lifetime. I think people are amazing, and the shitty terrible people don't prevent me from appreciating the good ones (whom I consider to be the majority). To me, life is wonderful. Except I don't like *my* life. I wish I could be somebody different, somebody less mediocre, someone more attractive, more intelligent, more motivated, more adventurous, and more knowledgeable about what I'm looking for in life. I'm 21 and all I can think about is everything I have missed out on and will miss out on in life. I wish there was some sort of way to choose to be someone else. I don't want to stop playing, I just wish I could start a new game."
Warning: Watch out for PMs pushing religion.,1396,32miq4,317,"**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 

***************************************************************************

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".  So our issue is fundamentally not with religion, but the misuse of it.**"
"Makes friends -> get close, really get to know them -> alienate them slowly with your issues -> get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime -> repeat",1391,b6mv0t,101,"This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. Just...why bother? If nobody can love me for the real me, and I can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?

Edit: thanks for the silver guys, I wasn't expecting this to be so well received."

I’m so embarrassed I can’t envision a future for myself that’s it’s affecting my relationships,1374,keucdv,85,"I’m envious of everyone around me. Even envious of the old me. I used to have goals and aspirations. Now all I do is sleep. I used to be smart, bright, had so much to say about the world and would easily slip into witty banter with my friends. Now I’m slow, everything I say feels scripted, every movement I make feels stiff, everything I do feels fake. I feel like an imposter. I got accepted to great colleges, attended one and ended up flunking three semester due to this void inside me. I was so embarrassed of the shell of a human I had become, hollow, purposeless, no goals, just empty. Even though I’m seemingly “much better” I’m still the same. Even when things are good, this void never leaves. When it gets quiet inside me, that void grows. I don’t know if I can continue living like this. I just want to feel normal. I’m talking to this guy I really like but he’s so motivated with such a bright future ahead of him, and he likely thinks the same of me based on what I told him, but those things I said aren’t me at all. I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I’m constantly questioning how I’m going to survive if everything keeps getting heavier and I keep getting tired and nothing has meaning anymore. I want to smile genuinely. I want to feel that spark of interest. Nothing. I don’t see anything and I’m jealous of my brother and my cousin. They used to be the delinquents who got subpar grades and I was the golden child. Now the roles are reversed and I feel like they’re constantly looking down on me. I’m so ashamed I can’t keep living like this."

I just sit around all day watching other people live their life on youtube and social media, it feels like I was never intended to partake in it. I don't want to live life. I didn't ask to be born. I want it to end.

Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,1366,i0nm3y,112,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

Have you ever felt like no one....literally no one cares about you?,1370,fj15uq,201,
I isolated myself for years as a coping mechanism for depression and as a result never grew as person but was content it wasn't possible to live like that.

Is anybody else here experiencing anhedonia?,1364,c1e49o,218,"It's the state of not getting pleasure from otherwise pleasurable activities.

Or, as I read once in a website thread about anhedonia, ""*essentially, I gain nothing from my daily life; my world is cold and, as such, it makes life seem the same way. Everything I look at, everything I do, looks and feels the same.*"".

Is this something you guys identify with? Because I sure do. What's it like for you?"
"When I stay home I get depressed for not doing anything. When I go out, I get very anxious and later get upset over any mess ups during that outing.",1366,6avndc,77,I can't win.
What's the point in asking for help if no one actually cares?,1364,i6bzfs,77,"I did everything right today. I gathered my thoughts. I talked to my best friend. And then I finally went to my husband and told him everything. The suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks, that I think I'm experiencing delusions and paranoia, that I'm genuinely scared for my safety.

And all I really got was a ""we'll get through this"" and that was it. I mentioned possibly needing to go to the ER or look for an in-patient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me ""but what if it financially ruins us? What then?"" And I just stopped. It's cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment. 

I did everything right. I fucking begged for help. But it's not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then it's too fucking late.

*I have a therapist and psychiatrist. I've tried 20 plus meds with absolutely no benefit. I've been dismissed by every psych I've had because to them it's just depression and they won't listen regarding the delusions I'm having that are completely fucking up my life."

My therapist committed suicide,1356,9okq9h,126,"Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope. I feel so alone. This wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. Selfishly, I feel hurt and abandoned. Everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. I don’t want to open up to a new therapist. The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?”  I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair. Like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. Thanks for listening. "

My girlfriend died,1354,a46ol5,64,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.

Since the outbreak, my family with whom I still live, mainly my father, is putting so much  emotional stress on me, yet, without that stress, I don't think I would've gotten to where I am now. You can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff ( I started working on myself, meditating reading more, trying to excercize, damn I've started painting watercolor. I don't how we do it, but we always find away to misinterpret one another in my family, assuming the worst in the other, we lack communication (but isn't that something to blame on the parent for not initating it in childhood?) I don't know where I am right now, but the idea of not existing anymore is tempting me so bad. I'm tired of thinking. I know I won't do it, but man these thoughts, they stick around once they hold onto you, don't they? It's different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you don't want to deal with anymore. I don't know, it lacks the self-pity. Feels almost like an act of self-love.

Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt.

I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. 

I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live.

I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man.

I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

I’m feeling suicidal... I really need someone to talk to please.,1330,kkv3pn,108,"I’m 23; female. Been contemplating suicide lately. When I was younger, my biological mother physically, sexually and emotionally abused me. My dad emotionally and verbally abused me growing up and always threatened to cause harm to me and blamed me for everything bad I did when I was young due to things I was taught to do (lie, steal, etc.) and talks poorly to others about me saying I’m a horrible person (not ever saying what he’s done, of course). I barely have friends. My dad never let me hangout with friends in public school so I’m kind of socially awkward. I’m in university but keep flunking out because I don’t have motivation to do work. I have a boyfriend who’s an only child and his mother hates me because she sees me as a threat... she has put her hands on me, said horrible things about me and has threatened me multiple times. I feel like I have a sign on me that says “abuse me, please.” I feel like a failure. I don’t speak to either of my biological parents anymore (haven’t seen my biological mother since my dad got custody of me at age 6 almost 20 years ago; don’t even know if she’s alive. I cut my dad out because he’s a piece of shit). I feel so alone and have been contemplating taking my own life. Can someone please, please please talk with me... I feel so alone and miserable. I hate myself and wish I was never born. All I’ve known is abuse and hate, and I have bad anger issues because of it. I know this seems like I’m asking for attention but I honestly need someone to be here for me, for once. For 23 fucking years, I’ve suffered with this trauma and feel like I have ptsd.

I can't believe she still considers me her best friend since depression made me that boring. She talked to me about her day for half an hour and I didn't even know what to say, I have become socially useless. I don't deserve friends like that, friends who can still bear and support the piece of shit that I am.

I promised her not to drink until the end of the lockdown but God knows that I will wash my problems away with vodka as soon as it ends.

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

I really thought suicidal thoughts were for idiots and pussies but well...,1325,ggzzpd,109,When I first heard of suicide and suicidal thoughts I wondered who the fuck does that. Now that fuck is me. Never knew I would be the one wanting to die and postpones my suicide each day.

"Millions of years of evolution among millions of species on this planet, all with a single common instinct within them :- Survive. And here my brain is telling me everyday to kill myself.",1330,b44k0z,120,"If that doesn't prove that depression is one of the biggest illness to ever plague us, then I don't know what will. I really hope one day people would emphathise and know how it feels to live this way and how hard it is to open up and how small it feels to beg for a way out only to be ignored or shut down, that too by people whom you would give your life for. Fuck this shit, I hope I was born heartless and emotionless so I didn't care about these kind of people but I still love them even after they refused to help me. I hope I die a miserable death. It would only be fitting to the already cruel game someone is playing with me. 

If I cower and fail to kill myself and live long enough to maybe make something of myself, I promise to do everything in my power to eradicate or atleast help the people suffering from this. "

Is anyone else afraid of opening up about their depression because it sounds needy or desperate?,1315,96cyx2,135,"I try to keep my mental health issues to myself. I don't want to tell others because I feel like an attention whore, and I've been accused of that before. What about you?"
I miss the old me,1321,d4d08a,72,"I’ve forgotten what genuine and pure happiness actually feels like. I’ve forgotten what it’s like to actually have a passion for life. These last few months have been a blur, I can only really recall a few days in detail. I miss the old me, she had so much potential. She had so many friends, she could actually read a book without being overwhelmed, she looked healthy  and prettier. Now I can’t even move out of bed. I just lie there waiting for someone to text me, but it rarely happens now because either people hate me now or I’ve pushed them away. I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week. Even my mother said this depression is making her life a misery. I used to be so full of life, but that seems like an eternity away, such a distant memory now. It feels like I have no one now and I have no energy to even move, let alone do anything slightly productive. Every single thing overwhelms me-the cat wouldn’t eat the food I gave him today because he’s so fussy and I just burst into tears. I’m so tired. I want out. Everything used to be so different.

EDIT: I never expected this post to blow up so much and I’m overwhelmed by the response rate and kind messages. I’m a bit too overwhelmed to reply just yet, but I will soon, know I’m appreciative of every single pm and comment. Thank you for making me feel less alone, this website is very special"
I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,1315,l3y52m,97,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this. But dont do this forever."
What does a person even do all day?,1309,cnp01x,144,"I don't get it. I have so many things I could do right now - exercise, listen to music, watch a movie, anything - but I have no motivation.

I don't want to be sitting in my room alone doing nothing, but I'm too tired to be outside doing something.

Other people in similar circumstances found it easy to just do the work but it's just a chore for me.

Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself,1305,ktqu2r,79,"January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself.  Today, I am in an even worse position than I was.  I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues.  I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

2 years of trying to avoid accepting that I have depression and today I can’t stop crying because of one of the stupidest reasons. I am so tired.,1300,itvsvx,30,"2 years of going through 2 breakups and multiple diagnoses of different diseases at a very early age and never did I feel any sadness or cried. I knew I was depressed and avoiding it. And today suddenly while getting out of car I dropped my key and it fell into a pothole and I can’t stop crying since then. 

Life has been shit and I’m so tired. I haven’t even read a book in months. I can’t study, can’t read, can’t even play video games with concentration anymore. I’m so tired and yet I have so many responsibilities.


Edit - Thank you to everyone who’s replying. I’m better now since the evening. I don’t know why but it was a sudden trigger. My car has been a way to just avoid any shitty situation. And losing the key was a very sudden trigger even though I knew I had another key. I get it’s a very weird thing to cry over but I just couldn’t stop. Thank you to all of you. The comments helped a lot.

Edit 2- Thank you everyone! I’m fine now. I guess the trigger was suddenly too much to handle. I’m gonna try to get help here. I don’t think I’ll avoid it anymore."
"The question I hate most: ""Are you okay?""",1304,7dstps,130,"Because the answer is always ""no"" but if I say ""no,"" they always ask me whats wrong.

High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand,1303,504py2,177,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Edit 2: still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day."
I had to fill out one of those depression tests today...,1298,7oydlq,97,"And I scored in the 'severe' range. This lead to the following exchange between my Doctors and I.

Doctor: This is a really high score.

"I spent my whole life walking on eggshells, trying not to offend, to please everyone. Now I feel like the most uninteresting person alive.",1297,fvwsmq,98,"The worst part is that now I have this ingrained in my behaviour. If someone says something that I disagree with, I try to twist my views to agree with theirs. 

I'm so worried about seeming normal, that I take everything someone says seriously, which makes me look like an idiot when I inevitably take seriously every joke that gets thrown at me.

When I examine my past behaviour, all the jokes seem obvious and all the twisted opinions seem stupid, but I can't help it. The only thing that brings out my true self is alcohol, but I don't want to go down that road.

I just wish I could be as confident sober as I am when drunk (slightly drunk, I've never been so drunk I couldn't control my behaviour, or puked and couldn't stand up straight). Everything feels so natural, so relaxed, I feel like a man instead of a mouse."
"I never realized it, but I always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because I never wanted them to go through what I'm going through right now.",1295,8uj4ci,48,"Funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me.

Looking back on it, it's kind of funny. No one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. The charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. A ridiculous catch-22, isn't it?

I was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on.

And now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. Completely blank and hollow... It's as if my face has been wiped away. Withered to dust."
Gaming won’t distract me forever,1292,lzvav6,109,"Lately I’m gaming 6-10 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty. I guess it’s better than wallowing in my depression, but the minute I stop I’m back to suicide ideation. I get it can’t fix my problems, but the anxiety of stopping and letting myself feel is too much. It’s getting bad again. Really bad. And I can’t really talk to anybody in my life about it. I’m not eating, I’m not sleeping, I’m just exisiting at this point and not really living. I just think if I pull myself away from the screen I’ll give into the temptations that keep haunting me.

EDIT: Wow I honestly didn’t expect this to blow up. Thank you everyone for your kindness, I appreciate it so much. The amount of support through your comments and messages is incredible, thank you so much. I should’ve mentioned I do have a job, it’s a casual job but it pays the bills. And I also do have a therapist, who is also great but I at times feel like I shelter him from a lot of what’s been going on.

Wow. I didn’t expect to get so many comments. Thank you so much. I’m not good at English, so it will take some time to read all of them, but I will do that little by little. And I won’t reply to comments. I’m sorry. It’s just I am very shy person. But I’m so grateful for everyone here. I am feeling much better today because of you. Thank you :)"
I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you,1294,g2c8pv,107,"And this compounds the depression.

Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" 

As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.

And so you get even more depressed about the fact that nobody understands what it's like to be depressed."
My friend killed himself,1290,br7w9r,100,"He was 18. I grew up with him and he was like my little brother. He was gentle and sweet and loved animals and flowers and thrifted clothes.

He was exhausted and he only saw one option and now I'm trying to pick up the pieces of myself. I am heartbroken and angry and devastated there is a crushing weight on my chest and I can't breathe. I feel too much while feeling too little.  I have struggled with depression and anxiety for years. But this. This is...overwhelming. It is excruciating. It is numbing. It is agonizing and yet it is impassive.  I feel everything and I feel nothing.   I don't want to die. But I don't know how to live.

Why do I miss the comfort of being depressed?,1281,mbb2la,111,"I used to be depressed 2 years back. I have since recovered with the help of lifestyle changes and medication. I've realised how fucked up my head was when I was depressed and now I see how much more light there is. But there are times that my thoughts wander and I start having those all consuming negative thoughts and suicidal ideation. Im aware though that I'm not actually depressed now. It's like I'm neither here nor there, I'm never really happy or never really sad. And I kind of miss being depressed.

I got shit done, I was moving, I was working good and as much as I'm scared to actually say it, it was a good day at work.  5 o'clock hits and the INSTANT I walk out that door, it all comes crashing down.  The 25 minute drive home was spent staring blankly ahead of me and I barely remembered the drive once I pulled in my driveway.  And once my ass hit the couch it was like fuckin game over.  I just plummet into this godawful mood like I want to fucking die and wished a semi had hit ice and flattened me earlier.  Intrusive, irrational, disgusting thoughts running buck-fuckin-wild with no control.  and the instant those are ""appeased"", all that energy turns into self-loathing.  I never spend time in my bedroom unless it's to sleep.  But I went to lay in bed and I just wanted to cry.  Me.  Who went 6 years without a single fucking tear and only cried earlier this year cause I got absolutely fucking shitfaced on alcohol and weed.  Laying in bed and wanting to cry for no reason, but not being able to because I built it into my system to suppress it and completely shut down emotionally any time there's a feeling like that.


this is why I'm scared to ever say ""yea I had a good day"".  the fall that immediately comes after is fucking soul-crushing.  every time.  what the fuck is wrong with me"
Do you hate complaining to people because you feel it will make them hate you because you are telling them your problems?,1285,75t4uu,143,
Sometimes I wish I killed myself when I was 12,1279,kwddjw,140,"I'm crying writing this so I'm sorry if something is incoherent.  I remember being sad when I 12 and thinking it was normal. 10 years later, nothing has really changed. I can recognize now how much I mean to some people now, which makes it even harder. It makes me wish I killed myself when I was more naive and selfish. I love the people surrounding me and they support me but I can't seem to be happy. I can't help but feel like everything that goes wrong around me is my fault and that there is no way to fix it. If anyone reads this, thank you for taking the time.

Sometimes when I pretend to be happy I actually think my mood gets better,1278,d4pn7l,101,"It's really weird. My friends in school have no idea about my depression and I like to keep it that way, so I always try my best to hide it and I smile and laugh and make jokes and sometimes, not very often, but still  my mood suddenly really gets a bit better but it will disappear immediately when I have a second to myself but it's just really weird. Maybe you can pretend so long that you can actually get happy. Sounds dumb but hey, trying to grasp every little straw here.

Edit: It's crazy reading how many people can relate. Thought I was being quite alone with that. Thanks for all of you sharing your thoughts. I guess at some point you are just so low down in that hole, that you seriously try anything to make it go away, even if it means, needing to force yourself through 3 hours fake laughing until for a moment you feel good, only for it to be taken away as soon as you have a moment alone to yourself and you would gladly collapse onto the floor and sleep for days"

Always have this feeling of wanting to go home but i don’t know where home is,1272,7fmaku,180,
Everyday I do literally nothing.,1267,ajcyb3,202,I lay in bed watching YouTube videos everyday. Sometimes I get up and watch YouTube videos at my desk. I have severe social anxiety and no friends. This is my life. 
I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),1269,l1hote,137,"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now. It felt really nice to finally vent, I’m staying strong and am not going to let depression win. I thought about deleting this, but if it helps someone I’ll leave it up :)"
Anyone else like to make themselves sad?,1266,c82ggr,141,"I'm currently sitting here laughing at myself because I'll literally put myself in situations where I'm destined to get sad by the outcome. 

I'm literally sitting here waiting for a text back from this guy as I refresh my ""Following"" activity on Instagram to see if he's liking anything so I can get mad/sad that I'm getting ignored. What is wrong with me ahahhahahahahhahaha"
Do you procrastinate even before doing things you enjoy?,1265,7dckh6,118,"Because I can't watch a movie or tv show without procrastinating first, it's so annoying to waste so much time, yet I still do it. "
Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes?,1269,dt5r5o,147,"I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

Think I'm going back on the Zoloft."

Fuck New Years,1265,eieavt,124,Anyone else depressed by New Years.
My mom tried to choke me last night,1260,kg9fpf,123,"this is gonna be a long post cause i wanna vent a little.as you can imagine i(F19)have a fucked up family.my parents hate each other and they don't even talk to each other unless it's absolutely necessary but they ""stayed for the kids"" :).my dad has problems too but my mom is insane.she humiliated,hit,threatened me since i was a child and she is a control freak.i wasn't allowed to leave the house by myself until 2 years ago that i went to university and even then,she took the bus with me,watched me going to the building,and then took the bus back home! Whenever i went out between classes with my friends,i was scared that somehow she is following me.i am not even studying the major i wanted because she did'nt let me move to another city and uni.she is paranoid that i am in a relationship with someone and ask me who am i talking to whenever i look at my phone and she tells me that i am a whore and i will do anything so i need to be controlled and wants to know what i am doing 24/7.she tried  so hard to make me dependent on herself financially,etc.she didn't let me go to the classes i wanted.she constantly cuts off the internet and tell us (my dad,my brother and me)that we are ganging up on her!she does'nt even let us eat what we want and we have to stick to the diet she has! she is so problematic and toxic  that even her family want to cut us off and won't invite us anywhere anymore.EVERYTHING should be how she wants or she would make everyone's life a nightmare(as if it is'nt already).this is just a little portion of the things she has done and if i wanna tell everything i should write a 100 page diary.i honestly don't know what i did to her i was a quiet and hardworking kid and i have always had my head  in books and had great grades and did'nt do ANYTHING bad in my entire goddamn life! I feel so stupid that it took me so long to realise that these things does'nt happen in normal families and well chasing a child  with a knife and threatening to kill them is not normal:).and the fact that i live in the most fucked up country does'nt help at all. now thanks to covid the classes are online and  i haven't seen anyone except for my family for a whole year and i think i am finally going insane.i have depression and anxiety and lately it got so bad that i can't even get out of bed and i can barely function.last night after i finally managed to finish my assignment i decided to watch something funny to forget the yellings and fights in the evening.just as i grabbed my phone she burst in and told me that i am not allowed to stay up this late then she jumped towards me and started choking me.she has done this before so it was not a suprise but this time i couldnt breath at all and i was sure that i am going to die.and when she let go she started screaming and cursing at 3 fucking a.m and told us that she is going to kill us in our sleep. then she claimed that my dad has hit her and gave her a concussion or sth:))).she is now going to sue my dad:).i am just worried about my dad and brother and not myself because i am suicidal and the only reason that i have'nt killed myself already is because of my brother(27).we don't even talk that much but i feel a responsibility towards him.he is going through enough with a fulltime  job and can't even afford living on his own. i can't hurt him like this but i don't know how much longer can i stay alive and live this nightmare.i talked to my dad several times but he insist that we should live together like a ""family""(wtf).i am now hopeless and if you can't advice anthing please at least tell me a painless and affordable way to kill myself."
I just want to be passionate about something again,1261,f8ofwq,80,"It's been so fucking long. I try to find a hobby, a goal, a fucking anything, but I just can't. Best case scenario I put a lot of effort into it for a week or two before I finally give up faking it. I mean I literally force myself to do things hoping I'll grow passionate about them, or at least enjoy them enough to look forward to doing them.


But I can't, and I don't know how to make it better. 40 years old, my youngest kids are starting to get to the point where they don't need me as much anymore which is good for them. I fear the day tho when I don't even have them to give me some purpose. Living out the rest of my days as a functional vegetable. Pretty sure that's where I'm headed.

My dad is gone... forever,1260,ibn6rc,76,"This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. 


My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. Me and the baby mama talked and decided we are probably gonna get back together we just need time but right now we are friends and I have been seeing her everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️"

Does anyone ever feel physically too weak. Everyday I experience a rush of weakness or something.

I know I will be alone until I die. I haven't hung out with someone in months, maybe even a year. I try to ask if people wanna spend time with me and go somewhere but they either say no or flake on me. I feel like the least important person in this entire world. I can't even maintain a friendship, so hoping for a relationship is unrealistic. I'm so sad and so tired of crying about this every single night"
Waking up is the most horrible part of the day,1234,lqumsg,66,"I’ve skimmed some idiotic self help articles last night and came across the genius statement that “in the morning things look better”. I really wonder for who. 

I despise waking up so much, the moments when I become conscious again, when I hear the alarm or just wake up naturally fill me with so much dread I can barely take it. Of course i always do in the end because things always have to go on and however bad it is, nothing ends. 

My personal Day of Judgement is tomorrow and I don’t think I will go to sleep tonight just so I don’t have to wake up in the morning of it."
Hate the idea of doing any work...,1233,i8b9ho,126,"Am I only one that feels this way? Along with all the symptoms of depression, the one that I find the least common is the lack of willingness and ability to do anything. 

I hate it when I know I have uni work, I hate it when I have to do with the family somewhere, I hate it when I have to iron clothes, I can’t study, I can never do my laundry in time, etc

It’s not coming from a standpoint of, “oh I preferrr not to do workkkk today”.

Just work in general is painful to me. It can ruin my day just hearing that I have any task to complete. 

Many depressed people are still having fun going to work, doing chores, etc. But it feels like death to me."
I'm going anti-social slowly.,1227,fbu6ub,81,"I've lost interest in finding friends.

My girlfriend died,1236,8wmeii,116,"Hey everybody,

On monday my girlfriend of 2.25 years died in a motorcycle accident. She was only 18 years old.

I don't really know how to deal with the loss. I cannot speak to most of my friends. I cried a lot but now I just feel numb. I don't want to feel numb. I want to cry. I want to be sad.

I don't know how to handle it."
I have lost my empathy.,1232,hvunye,113,"Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing. I have avoided them for about 5 years because of this. I'll come to family gatherings when it's unavoidable, like Christmas, but every time I'm asked to come visit someone (or someone asks me if they can visit) I make up excuses."

Two days ago I texted cousins, friends, and co workers and everyone said they were busy. or just plain didn't reply.

Anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable?,1220,a6i9ww,103,I’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. I’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. If you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. Ask me if I’m okay. Ask me if there is anything you can do. Don’t just make the statement that you think I’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. I’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. I’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because I’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. Christmas coming up is so scary to me because I know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that Christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and I’m absolutely terrified of it.

A burden.,1223,kqu0by,85,"No one wants to spend time with a negative person, no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time. No one wants to hear bad things, complains, issues that others are struggling with. None of this is fun, so no one truly cares, no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more.
Most people are selfish and that's ok. People don't own people. Everyone deals with things and that's ok.

So I'm giving up asking for help, I don't want to bother anyone anymore. I don't want to upset others, waste their time...
I'm just a nobody, a burden who doesn't deserve anything!

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this, probably because I've isolated myself completely and I guess, subconsciously I might appeal to this as a last attempt at admitting I desperately need help, I'm ignoring loved ones, messages from friends, everyone and I don't even understand why. All I know is that I had enough of feeling lonely, enough of this unbearable pain, enough of hurting myself because I can't take it anymore."
It’s not fair.,1224,essxe0,122,"I fucking hate it so much. People around me, just go through everything with so much energy and power and they’re still so happy and never exhausted.

I can’t remember the last time I was actually happy. I hate drinking because it makes me so fucking sad, but I love it because I can accept my sadness completely.

I don’t want to be lonely but I just want everyone to leave me alone so I can find the strength to kill myself. I hate it. I really hate it. It’s not fair, and fuck it. No one understands it, everyone asks me to open up and when I do they don’t know what to say.

I just wish everyone would leave and never have a good memory about me so I can kill myself.

He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read. Now I don’t know what to do. All I’ve done since I found out is cry. I feel worse now then when I went into the hospital. Thanks for reading. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this. I just really need a place to rant. "
"my biggest fear, after vulnerability, is that i will go unloved once people know me for who i really am",1218,hpbn2u,60,"as a high functioning depressed person, i don’t know which is an act—the depression or the coping?"
"I'm smoking cigarettes and drinking beer so that I have something to do with my hands. I lost interest in music which always been my passion. I spent the last 5 days browsing Youtube, alone in my flat with hardly any news from my surroundings.",1220,d6zcnw,169,"I should look for a job but procrastination has taken a toll on me. My near future is uncertain and I feel unable to take responsible decisions for myself. I have to leave my flat in the end of the month. I will probably end up living at my parents again for a few months until I find something to do with my life. In November, it will be one year since I haven't been intimate with a guy and it makes me feel like I am loosing my femininity.

I don't know who I am, don't know what I want, barely know how to get the things I need."
Fuck all of this,1216,e88epz,127,"I'm stuck at home. I have nothing to do. I have no friends. I have no reason to go outside. All my family does is yell at me for the littlest things (especially my mother). My physical condition is worse than ever before. Every part of my body hurts. As soon as I start to break down or cry, I get yelled at even more. I feel like I'm isolated in a place that might as well be hell. I have nothing in my life that gives me even the tiniest bit of joy.

Edit: Thank you guys so much for all the kind words. And thank you to whoever gave this post gold. I feel comforted knowing that there are people out there that can relate to my struggles. It may seem hopeless now (it certainly does feel that way for me), but we'll get through this together. Love all of you!❤️"
sometimes i dont care if i wake up again or not,1214,fcbdvk,58,"why would i, it'd just be another day of people screaming at me and feeling like shit because of everything i cant do

then its 2am again, everything reminds me that im alone in the world and it'll always be like that because who the fuck would be with someone like me? 

it'd just be another day of me thinking how my life would be if someone loved me

i'd finally be so happy...i wouldnt be alone anymore

i'd finally have someone that loves me...just imagine me having someone that does want to talk to me, that wants to spend his life with me too and...and we're happy together

but on the inside i just know it wont happen...i just...i know it

sometimes i wish i was strong enough to just kill myself, but i cant even do that

i wish it stopped hurting..."
How do you guys find the motivation to do literally anything?,1214,cjcntr,292,"I have no hope, I see no future and can't push myself to do the most basic of acts (e.g. brushing my teeth). How do you break through that feeling of the uselessness of your deeds? How do you find the motivation to do the things you want/need to do?"
"Does anyone else just spend most of the day on YouTube,Reddit,twitter etc ?",1215,9jnr6m,165,"I don’t have a life (haven’t in many many years,I’m only 25) I’m depressed and anixious all the time even when I’m watching YouTube vids. I just spend the day in zombie like state scrolling through Twitter or YouTube.

I’m just living through other people I’ve never meet. I’m just waiting for the latest news and drama. I think about suicide everyday. 

Can anyone relate ?"
My wife died and now i'm a single father to 3 kids.,1211,5pi2dw,164,"So um... I still haven't gotten over this. Money isn't the issue - I have accumulated some wealth from my family, her death, and my job. I can keep myself occupied in the morning. However, when its nap time its silent and lonely. No friends, family isn't available. 

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard. 


None of them will ever know her. She had loads of issues but I thought we could work them out. I thought she was better. 


I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   

The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. 


There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.


I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. 

I'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. 

EDIT: She is alive and at the hospital in stable condition."
I almost killed myself tonight,1214,e3avf3,156,"I know nobody will read this...

I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. 

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy. 

I just want this to end so badly. Why can't she care about me? About my life? I just need a friend in her. Fuck my life so bad."
my bed is my best friend,1209,bcs0ka,62,"It makes me feel safe, it makes me feel at home. It will never laugh at me, I will never feel insecure or exposed or watched while at bed. I can cry in my bed for hours on end and never will it say mean things to me or make me feel bad. I won't bother it and I won't disappoint or fail it, nor does it. I can sleep on it which is the best part of the day and it makes me feel cozy and warm.

my bed is my best friend and I love it to death"
"“You’re Mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that”",1212,8eanjx,165,"Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. "
life is a chore,1209,d1z3jp,58,"Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life. There are no questions to our daily duties, as we're following the propaganda of what others expect us to be. 

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health. Similarly, my emotional health is just as bad and it deteriorates my motivation to do anything. I have no one personal and close that can fully understand my situation. I lost the one person I loved deeply and now she is with someone else. There's nothing and no one left to live for.

I hate going to sleep at every night knowing I'll wake up again, doing the same thing over. I hate waking up every morning with this heavy chest pain. I hate life and I wish I could give up and end everything."
A stranger hugged me yesterday,1204,7xb1sa,84,I was crying yesterday talking to my professors because I was having an awful day. And this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn’t realize we were having a conversation. He felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. He was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.
It pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice,1210,85ubu6,91,It just isn't. And not because I say it isn't. It just isn't. I try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better. Coping strategies just calm me down. Smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable. I don't even know. 
"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself",1206,9z3v5l,105,"First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)


Edit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)"
People are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help. But you can literally be crying in school/public and people will just stare at you and not do anything,1212,9p2wjo,76,And then when you kill yourself they say they couldn’t have done anything to stop it. And they say they’re here for anyone who wants to talk. That lasts about a week. 
"Anybody else sick of the ""i feel the same"" you get everytime you try to discuss your depression with someone?",1201,de9tqy,110,"Then that person tries to turn it 180° and talks about stuff that makes him sad

I don't know how I'll reward myself since I have no money, but I'm definitely going go since this is an achievement and we need to reward ourselves when we do good.

I love you all. Happy New Year! "
Is it just me or does depression make basic hygiene & waking up SUPER difficult?,1201,an3yfi,200,"Ever since the diagnosis, it’s hard to get out of bed, including showering, socialising, walking (I’m not going to even call it exercise), vacuuming, combing, etc. 

My Dad thinks that it’s laziness. He says getting out of bed & working out can lessen depression."
I just want to vanish and be forgotten for the rest of eternity.,1202,g0qyn8,56,"If there was button to erase all traces of my existence including being in people's memories, I would have smack the shit out of that."
"Please don't tell me ""it will get better""",1193,g36yxc,196,"Sometimes I don't want to hear ""it will get better"" because I don't see it and I don't believe it. Sometimes I just want someone to sit with me in silence or to listen to me and comfort me or just laugh with me. I don't know if anyone else feels like this but I do...and also i just want ONE DAY where i don't want to die.

sooo another edit: umm... I MIGHT begetting suspended because I was trying to get a rude user away from you guys because he was being a bully and saying mean/hurtful things and he took this a verbal abuse.

"Can't because I'm depressed, depressed because I can't.",1195,ak2q1c,93,"Anyone else feel this? 

Can't work because of reasons raised by depression, depressed because I can't work.

Alone, no friends, no girls ever interested in me because of depression, depressed because I can't have those things.

Countless more"
Anybody wish they were 8 years old again and could start their life over.,1191,9th9br,100,"I have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that I wish I could take back. My life is in shambles and I wish I could just magically start over. My laziness is the death of me and I constantly fight demons in my head. It would be much better to just cease to exist at this point. That seems very peaceful. Life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting. 

I used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in 10-20 years I'll be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse. Everytime I think I hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless. I won't get into specifics because there are too many to list but I am starting to feel like a pathetic failure. I always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but I just ended up becoming a no life bum. I wish I would just die while sleeping sometimes. Waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world. Just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point. I wish I didn't feel this way but I do. I'll end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system. Even if one person reads this I'll he happy that I got this out there and could share my depression and rage which I kept bottled inside of me for so long. Keep kicking y'all hopefully we can all be happy one day."
i want to be excited about life again,1187,h066i7,42,"i had a dream of a time where i was genuinely happy with my life. i saw a lot of people that i cared about and it felt very nostalgic and i felt really happy. then i woke up and realized none of those people are in my life anymore or at least on the same basis as they used to be. i went through today with nobody speaking to me, and now im about to go to bed without accomplishing anything because i felt really depressed. bonus points for not eating anything in 2+ days. don’t really know the point of this post tbh. just felt like i needed it somewhere

update: thank you all for the love and advice. i feel a little better and motivated and honestly expected this post to get lost in the sub. this community is amazing and i’m really grateful <3

update: ate something. nice"
I just realized that I bully myself,1191,izi1r1,104,"Everything I do, everything I say. A voice pops into my head and speaks nasty things to me. I used to consider it a different person, but I realized that it was me bullying myself. 

""Hey, I'm here!"" 

""No one cares that you're here."" 

""Sorry I'm late""

""Absolutely no one cares that you're late or even here.""

*Gives opinion*

""Who asked you?"" 

""Maybe I'll text ____""

""They don't like you""

""Hey, look what I made""

""They think it's ugly. You should've done a better job.""

""You're a fat slob"" 

""Why do you bother living? Nobody likes you.""

""You're the energy leech in everyone's life"" 

And so on."
I don’t want to die,1189,begzxx,82,I just want to cease to exist.
I’m so caught up in my web of depression that I sometimes forget that there are people out there who are content with their lives and want to keep living.,1189,ck48n9,103,"It just seems so strange to me that most people don’t spend every waking moment hating themselves and thinking about death. 

Like while they’re waiting for the train what do they think about if not jumping on the tracks and ending it right there?
Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive. It makes me feel so guilty for all the times I’ve wished to get cancer so I can die without having to do anything. I wish I could donate my physical health to someone who needs it so I can just let my sick brain shrivel up and die."
"I feel dirty around nice, normal people",1181,jkublj,80,"I hate it. I can't comfortably interact with clean, wholesome, kind individuals. I always feel so ragged and unclean in comparison.

Edit to add: Thanks for the replies everyone. I'm sorry so many of you can relate to this but it's nice knowing I'm not alone."
You ever wish you didn't have any family so you wouldn't feel so bad about wanting to kill yourself,1184,7z3rzy,98,I think about killing myself fairly often but I don't think I could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days I wish that I was just alone and no one was around to care so I could just do it 
I’m out,1185,856z53,49,"Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply."
Does anyone feel like they're just overreacting and destroying their life 'intentionally',1177,c8pvki,88,"Even tho now I've seen a psychiatrist I still caught myself thinking ""why don't you just start being normal"". Like getting up on time and eating food and doing normal work isn't that hard why the hell can't I do it!!? I would hate myself forever if I'm jsut destroying my life because I'm living with a victim mindset."
Anyone have trouble planning for the future and being impulsive because you think you'll kill yourself eventually anyways?,1173,7eaeik,130,
Anyone cry at the sight of normal families?,1175,ct268j,150,"It started when I was quite young. I remember being in a play park and seeing a girl get pushed on a swing by her father. I remember that gut wrenching feeling and tearing up. Today I was at work and saw a mother cuddling her daughter and she said ""you're squishing me"" and the mother replied ""that's because you are so squishable and i love you"" that shit made me need to close for five minutes."
Today I'm finally throwing away my suicide note,1176,b5qa2r,72,"I've been a better state of mind this past year, but I think this is the day that I finally commit to it.

I'm not going back again. I made the changes that got me here after almost a decade of misery, and I can do it again if I end up back where I was.

I hope, if you read this and are suffering yourself, that you see this as evidence that no matter how long you've felt this way, recovery is always a possibility.

Much love x"
Sometimes I wish I could get killed so people wouldn't be mad that I killed myself. Has anyone else felt this way?,1168,4zhjwo,229,"Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't think suicide watch is the proper place since I don't necessarily want to commit suicide. I just want to cease living.

I feel like no matter what I can't escape the demons I have. No matter how well I'm doing, my mind is always like ""the fuck? Get back in line."" No matter what, they'll always come back up and I'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.

Even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. I'd be dead.

**Edit to add: Thank you everyone for responding. You all truly helped calm me down. Now that I've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, I feel better.**

Anyone else's depression made worse by the way the world is?,1165,conynd,157,"I'm constantly so angry that I have to do all these things i dont want to do just so i can continue living, which I'm not even interested in doing.  I'm angry I'm in a major that I hate and that the fields I was interested in make so little money that the field isnt even worth pursuing imo. I'm angry I'm going to have to work +8 hours a day 5 days a week in a job I dont like, I'm angry that i have to spend my mornings getting ready and driving to a job i won't like. Ill get shit benefits and 10 days vacation a year, so for the next 30 years I get to be miserable with the exception of 10 days out of the year when I can travel which is the only thing I'm interested in anymore. Probably what makes me the most angry is seeing all these talentless people on YouTube making millions for being morons while I have to go to school for 4 years to even make a livable wage and it pisses me off.  I get the whole ""life isnt fair"" thing but I can't stop being angry about it and everyday it gets worse."

Depression prevents you from doing the things you know will make you feel better.,1161,5kkp2e,119,
My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2,1159,h88bej,171,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?"
"I wish it were socially acceptable to tell your friends ""Hey, my life is super toxic right now and slowly killing me, can we hang out sometime?""",1164,4s8r2c,99,

My bed is my safe place,1151,adb46g,110,"I know this is the clearest sign of depression, but I love staying in my bed. Even when im not tired I feel tired. When I lie down and hide in the covers, I feel like I  can avoid the world and the anxieties that come with it. As a result I'm so unproductive as well and hate myself for it, and thats why Im in bed now.

I’m tired of being tired all the time.,1152,eqc90a,83,"I’m lying in bed exhausted. Tried to do homework but I ran out of energy. I’ve been spending an hour or two in bed in the afternoon every day for well over a week now. I feel okay during the day but an hour or two after sundown I just find myself exhausted. I go to bed five or six hours early too wiped to stand, not tired enough to sleep. I get up an hour or two before bedtime to just fiddle my thumbs in the little to no time I have left.

This is weird for me. I used to be like this after a stressful work day but now it’s everyday even on otherwise good days. It makes me so furious that I can’t do anything. I have school, I want to paint and make little indie games but in the little time off I have to hone these skills, I’m stuck paralyzed. 

Fuck depression. Depression is a little bitch."
Do you guys ever quit typing your comment mid-sentence because you feel like your words aren't useful?,1148,44zfxa,131,"I want to help people on this subreddit with my experiences and pains but it's so hard for me to bring myself to hit post when all I feel is like my opinions and advice are useless,,

Best part of the day is sleeping,1146,fduqan,57,"when night comes, you just lay there in bed thinking of all your stressful problems then suddenly everything goes dark, your conciseness goes into rest, you are no longer aware of what's life or death, your brain is numb, and you seize to exist even for a moment, before start dreaming, you feel so happy like that time when you wer....   


you wake up at 7 am ready to repeat your boring routine thats been bothering you for quite a while now but you have no choice but to keep going."
No motivation to do anything,1142,kxrcfh,88,"Does anybody else just not want to do anything. I’m stuck inside my room all day with nobody to talk too. Even if there was somebody should I burden them with my thoughts? How is that fair? It’s best to keep it all to myself so when I explode I only hurt myself.

I'm on the verge of crying all of the time but I've pretty much cried myself out at this point. Every day I wake up I remember that I'm living in a world without my buddy

I'm so tired all of the time but I'm trying to keep it together, but I know that if I don't distract myself then I'll start questioning what the point in even living is. I keep looking at pictures of me and my buddy together but it's not the same without him, I'd give anything to have him back. I'm half a person without him and quite honestly, I don't know if I'm going to get through this"
Anyone waste time doing nothing?,1137,azt8rd,143,"I spent the last hour or two just switching between youtube, reddit and some other websites, spending no more than a couple of minutes on each. I couldn't barely finish a single video on youtube and I'd just keep refreshing the home screen for a bit, then checking reddit, then some other forums, then the game I'm afk in, then repeat again. It's too much effort for me to even finish a video from start to finish, let alone listening to music or even playing the game im afk in.

Anyone else just feel like doing nothing, feel like not wanting to live, when you are depressed?

  

Edit: Thank you for the reddit gold, even though its my first time getting it, I don't feel as appreciative as I should be considering the state that my mind is in, sorry"
"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist.",1134,4z1114,88,"It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart.

my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,1131,lbpsfo,93,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

&#x200B;

edit: thank you for the wholesome, the silver, and the hugz  😭 😭 😭 i did not expect this post to get any attention let alone receive my first reddit awards. I'm crying tears of joy and hope now. thank you kind internet strangers, i will be sure to pay it forward. <3

Disassociating?,1140,inmi3d,61,"Sometimes when I'm out with friends I'll have those 'episodes' where i zone out and feel like im just watching things from outside of my body. Like i don't even know why I'm here, i listen to my friends talk and don't understand what they are saying. All i want to do is disappear because i already feel like im not there mentally. Its like my body and my mind separate. It lasts for a minute or so and then im left with a weird feeling afterwards."
I just want a hug,1132,i4ztxv,95,"That's all. It won't fix my Depression and it won't fix my existence. Everybody that's dear to me lives far away. I pretend to be alright to my family and parents cause i'm scared to break it to them, cause they might react with disbelief and tell me i should calm down. I did not have a real sincere hug in.... actually i don't know. I think like 7 years. I just want someone to hug me and tell me shit will be alright. I don't care if it's true or not. I'm introverted and why and would never for the sake of me engage in any physical contact like hugging with someone that gets me and that i like. I am also scared of telling ppl i do know and that know about my depression cause i think i would look weak and that they would make fun of me or whatever even tho that's very unlikely. I just want to feel like a human again, i really just want to have someone i like check in on me and not just send a meme and then be on their merry way. I just really, truly and from the bottom of my heart want a genuine hug i'm just that starved of physical contact cause i act and pretend that i don't like it while i wish for nothing else. Other people see me as this strong, independent guy doing his thing, going his own way and keeping his head up high while infact i just want to curl up cause i can't Deal with doing a Single mistake. Why do i have to be like this? I can't expect ppl do help me how i would need it if i don't tell them on the other Hand i'm scared cause i'm paranoid to be starved in the back. I feel like i will never be able to open to someone completly ever again, especially not in Person even tho that's the one and only thing i want to do.

Edit: I really wanna just thank you all for comenting and upvoting. I mean, i did not think for this to be successful in helping me a bit atleast. I kinda just wrote this cause i had a huge mental breakdown and didn't know what to do anymore. You guys commenting are not filling the void i want filled cause that's basically impossible for you to do but don't be fooled, i appreciate EVERY SINGLE PERSON that commented here giving good vibes. Some people wrote they feel it and also want a hug i just wanna say: Feel hugged atleast by me!. I love all of you writing here and i am really thankful for your support and you guys being so nice and cute. Good vibes to you all and i hope all of you feeling bad find a way to cope with shit and get better <3

Edit 2: I'm really overhwelmed by All of you guys coming here. I'm sad seeing so many people in the same state as me but i'm so happy some of you try to give the best Advice they possibly can. Maybe i haven't found myself but let me tell you, every Single one of you commentin changed something for me. Don't care who you are or where you are from. ALL of you are worth something and even tho alot wrote ""this probably won't change anything"" you taking the step to write a comment? That does change something. I appreciate everyone here and you all got my respect for dealing with this shit illness but trying to look out for each other. I love all of you <3"

Told girlfriend I'm suicidal and got kicked out,1129,7zx1dh,207,"Finally confided in my gf last night about my depression and she told her mom and everyone in my family and then she said I shouldn't live with her anymore. I got kicked out and she won't let me inside to get my things. We have a 6 month old daughter together.

I slept outside. It's 7 am now and I don't know what to do. I use her car to get around and now I don't have that. I also lost my job because she wouldn't let me go to work and I don't have friends or money for uber

I am a 17 year old student in korea and I am stressed overwhelmingly by academics and the SAT. Please read my story and tell my story to others. I am going to jump next week. Goodbye.,1130,htkzjq,269,"I just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom, dad, and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I don’t know who. I’m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home. These days believe it or not, I’ve been doing some things that a regular high schooler should not do like sipping lean, vaping, and taking sleeping pills to sleep at night from the nightmares. I hope I can overcome this, but that time seems to late. Goodbye."
I just want a hug,1127,ifdri5,89,"I wish I was in somebody's arms and tell me it's gonna be OK. Or crying on someone would be wonderful too. I have absolutely nobody. Loneliness fucking sucks.

How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?,1129,8yvqlv,272,"I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. 

I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me. 

Anyone else feel this way? "

"I need at least one person to see this. I have 0 reason to live, because I can't care about my obligations to others.",1127,lazmim,242,"If you google ""reasons to live"" they pretty much all say that they carry on living because they dont want to cause pain to their loved ones. I have very little loved ones, and I cant express enough how little I give a shit about how sad they're gonna be when I kill myself. There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. 

I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried."

"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.",1105,5sko4x,74,"After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. "
43 and completely lost,1100,hetkuq,210,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.

When I’m having an episode, as I currently am, I really hate the feeling of not being interested in anything.  I feel like I waste entire days just trying to find something I might enjoy doing, but it’s all been fruitless. 

It drives me crazy.  I just waste my entire weekend doing nothing of substance and go back to work on Monday."

Anyone masturbate as means to deal with depression?,1107,c614t6,209,I've been dealing with depression for a number of years now. I find masturbation as a temporary relief of that feeling. Does anyone else feel this way?
I don't often see anyone mention the addictive nature of depression.,1105,a0qajj,79,"All the symptoms are negative; short temper, self destructive tendencies, constant muscle pain, sporadic tears. Yet there's something deep in the abyss that beacons. There's an urge to indulge in all the negative feelings that come along with the disease, to be engulfed in it."

It kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life, and the person they’re talking to says *Well at least it isn’t any worse.* That makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because *obviously* my life isn’t actually *that bad*"
I’m kinda disgusted with myself,1095,iv21g3,103,"I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.


Edit: wow I did not expect to get such a huge response. I basically passed out on my bed right after posting this  but I only expected maybe 1 or 2 people to comment. Also a big thanks for the awards. It’s been a difficult path, I’ve been trying to clean for the past week or so and it feels like I haven’t made so much as a dent in the mess but I appreciate the kind words and motivation.

Anyone else feel like they have to try and fight to survive because of their depression?,1102,c3sx8x,87,Depression is honestly on the verge of winning everyday but I'm still determined to try and beat it because I can't hurt those close to me like that.

Is it worth waiting to see if your life eventually ever gets better?,1088,lsyxvb,129,"I’m about to turn 25 and I don’t even want it this year. The disingenuous attention is going to bum me out.

Long story short, I lost my job and then got stuck at my parents house. My dad is very narcissistic and toxic and is often damaging to my mental health.

I spent this past year developing myself more, learning more into my career, reading books, becoming spiritual, and finding a cause to do good in the world. I figured all of this is pointless I might as well spend it doing at least one thing that’s bigger than me and then I can die happy. I don’t need to be famous I just wish I can move the needle positively in society or in a community in some way. 

I don’t know what that is yet but I’m learning a lot of marketing and I consider myself a creative and passionate individual. I am a musician also. I also volunteer and am involved but it’s all remote. 

Right now I don’t have a real job, I have no friends, and now my band is falling apart. Last year, no one showed up to my birthday gathering, which is kind of what caused me to start this journey. I can start a new band by myself, and I can move out and find new friends that aren’t toxic and like me and respect me, maybe even find a girlfriend. I used to have at least a couple of those things at different points in my life. I’ve been through 12 salary paying job interviews these past 2 months and none of them bite.

Now I have NOTHING. And I spent a year on myself for NOTHING. I have friends family and my therapist keep telling me “just wait, your time will come” and other similar pointless advice that gives you nothing tangible to work with and instead is just “your life sucks, you can’t do anything about it, just wait and see if it gets better”

Well what if it doesn’t? What if I get hit by a car tomorrow? God, I really hope I do. I mean, I’m thankful that I’m healthy and alive under a house but I still pay exorbitant bills and it’s really not easy even with a garbage freelance job

I don’t want to live through this bullshit anymore. It’s been a year. I want my reparations back for all the people who lied to me for all this time. 

Am I being a freak or what? Why can’t I just catch a fucking break?

Edit: you guys are really sweet and this made my day, thank you"
Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself,1096,8xdnp7,163,"I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F). Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore. I'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and I have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if I was dead). At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts 

Edit 2: OMG so many comments and messages. I can't believe so many people care about me taking a little trip. I'm reading through all of them and I appreciate all the tips and offers. I will update y'all after I leave (might be like a week) and will upload pics and stuff afterwards. One thing this has made me realize is how lucky I am to have the ability right now to pack up and go wherever I want with very little consequence "
High functioning depression,1096,m8ijzq,82,"I think I have high functioning depression. I can go about my day, socialize, work, etc but inside I just feel so dead, just going through the motions. I shut myself off from feeling anything because I don't want to. When I'm not feeling numb, I'm sad and crying. I'm so tired of feeling this way, never happy or content.

Recently during a sad period I managed to open up to a few close friends. That helped a bit. I took some walks and exercised too. But then I woke up the next day and became numb again. Sigh."
"I just went from not leaving my room for 3 years with the biggest fear of going outside, to wanting to solo travel again! In 3 days.",1090,cxzfzt,95,"Hi I’m 21M and before this Friday morning, I had never traveled before in my entire life without my parents. No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

So I bought myself flowers today.,1098,bxktkp,64,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today :)"
"Life in this society is such a catch 22. People are always saying ""reach out, if you ever need me"" but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed. They either deny it or downplay your depression if they find out.

Am I explaining this clearly enough?

I just don't do anything,1087,ea539h,105,"I never felt like I was depressed, but recently I just have not been doing anything... My days look like this: Wake up, lay in bed, go to sleep, repeat process...

"In 8 days I have lost my job, my girlfriend left me and I’ve diagnosed with cancer.",1090,c49m8a,124,"I feel so overwhelmingly sad. My whole life has crumbled so quickly. 

I’ve lost my job because I can’t focus at work. I can’t get a grip of my emotions and spend all day walking around like a zombie. 

My girlfriend has left me because she says she can’t be in a relationship with me anymore, I am absolutely in love with her and don’t know what I will do on my own. 

The cancer was diagnosed last week, stage 2. I have to go for surgery soon to establish if it’s moved on to stage 3. Strangely, this is the part that least upsets me. 

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I want to sleep, but I can’t. I want to be numb to all this. To make the pain stop but I can’t. All I do is cry constantly, I just don’t know what to do.


EDIT:  Oh my goodness. I went to sleep last night, finally. Woke up and saw the absolute outpour of messages on here. You guys are unbelievable. I can’t even begin to describe my gratitude that people who don’t know me would spend time sending such thoughtful messages. I love every single one of you. Thank you so much."
"I've never felt so sad, alone, lonely, and isolated before. At the same time I want to stay isolated. I don't want to socialize or be around people. I don't quite understand what's going on with me. I might be broken.",1087,ish32s,47,"I know that I ""can"" talk to friends and family about my feelings but at the same time I just ""feel"" like there is no one I can talk to. Nor do I possess the capacity to voice my feelings aloud. Whenever I try talking with a friend I just clam up. I don't understand myself. I don't understand why I am like this. Why can't I just express how I'm feeling. Maybe because expressing feelings aloud makes them real or permanent. A perspective voiced gives permenamce to those thoughts. I'm still unsure of anything and everything."
Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them.,1087,l8sivo,71,"Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?,1088,8kmlu5,89,"I don't mean just general regret for your life choices. I mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.

I don't know. I guess I'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again."
i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit,1089,l7ru4t,106,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

Annus Horribilus,1072,g41t6v,50,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness."

my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore,1066,ltevc3,108,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)"
Every time I wake up from sleeping I’m just like *sigh* “fuck.”,1061,e73q7r,61,Or sometimes I’ll be doing anything and i stop for a second and I’m say under my breath “fuck I hate my life dude.”
Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,1056,cbhfwy,55,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything.

I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.
Have a good day. "

"Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.",1049,7bv27g,159,"To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this.

February 22nd 2020,1043,f9ita6,55,"I almost killed myself this past Saturday. I’m not sure if I was fully committed but I was invested enough to write a note, tidy up my room, and pick out which pills I was going to use to do it. My last cry for help was me sending my goodbye messages to my loved ones, I must’ve subconsciously known someone would come rescue me from myself. My friend came, my roommate came, my mother came... I took 6 pills but what I didn’t tell them that I kept slipping myself more. I knew I wouldn’t die but I wanted to come close— I wanted to know if death was truly what I wanted and if I got it I suppose my choice would’ve been made either way. My dad, whom I love dearly, flew in to be near me and I so very much appreciate it but to be quite honest, I don’t think this will be the last time I do this. I just don’t feel much except weariness anymore and I’m tired. To anyone reading this that may happen to know me irl by some miracle of a chance, thank you for being there for me :)"

"35 year old male, major depression, I am afraid to go back to work. Dreamless sleep is my new fav thing.",1042,lfy4fr,94,"Hi, I just wanted to check in and join the club with y'all. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. The last 4 years it turned into major depression. I'm just scared. I don't want to die, and i just want to stop thinking about suicide. 

I'm fighting as hard as I can, but it's not going away. I take my meds, and have been seeing a dr. for 6 years. I'm on effexor, wellbutrin, lorazepam for sleep, and then clonidine to stop the nightmares. Ritalin for focus, armor thyroid for energy, and I haven't started yet but probably testosterone soon. 

I work out a lot. So i'm in great shape. I attract females but then watch then lose all attraction EVERY TIME as they realize something's wrong with me. This rejection hurts way more than just straight up right-off-the bat rejection, because it's just a constant reminder that i'm too flawed to be loved. Now i'm so afraid of the rejection i can't even be normal around them, i tremble, stutter, say stupid cringey things. 

Everyone in my family is dead except for my dad (who doesn't really like me), and some distant cousins. It feels like everyone doesn't like me. 

I hate this fucking illness. I feel like i'm in hell and I don't know what i did to deserve to be here. 

I am afraid to go back to work. I am a geologist, but if you only have a BS, then you're stuck in the oilfield. It's very lonely out there, I don't fit in, everyone makes it apparent that i'm weird. it's 12.5 hour shifts for however long it takes to drill the goddamn hole. Work, Cry, Sleep, Repeat. for weeks. 

Then if I'm lucky, I get 2 weeks off to scramble to try to find someone to love me.

I'm self destructive with the things I say and do. Sometimes it seems like i'm trying to ruin my own life, just so i can push myself over the edge and finally do it. 

I really miss liking to do things. I used to like going places, playing video games, playing guitar. 

Anyway, Hi, I'm here with y'all. Cheers."

I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,1034,d0askq,138,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

thanks"

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion... "
being alive is so exhausting,1012,8bq8dv,101,
I feel too sensitive to exist,1017,fs78rp,166,"Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness.
My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.
How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone.

Edit: this post is open to anyone wanting to express their feelings. Unite fellow fragile people :)

Edit #2! Thank you for all of the replies and helpful advice. I know I’ll be coming back to re-read many of these messages. Y’all are getting upvotes! 
I know I’m in need of a therapist, still it was nice to write down these thoughts here. I posted this during a dark moment, woke up feeling better.
I’ll do my best to reply. Stay safe, indoors!"
Do you ever secretly wish for bad things to happen in your life so you feel justified to be depressed?,1014,7xekj9,84,"I keep on coming back to this in my mind but feel bad even thinking about it... does anyone else feel this way? 

Edit: Thank you for all the responses and thank you for making me feel like a less shitty human being haha. Love all of you, stay strong. "
"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out",1012,c6phmz,102,"I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying."
I can't kill myself until my cat dies,1012,lcfdn4,86,"For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with constant suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts of self-harm. It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  


EDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day. It seems like the general consensus is that I should get another cat, and I agree. It's something I'm looking into, and I'll be sure to update when I get a second furry friend. "
No one showed. I should have expected that.,1015,73o2tr,170,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."
MY FAILURES MAKE ME FEEL GUILTY. I DON'T FEEL WORTHY TO HAVE FRIENDS OR BE AROUND FAMILY. ITS UNCOMFORTABLE AND CONVICTING.,1013,io8mpe,73,"I just want to be successful already so this pain can go away. They say money can't make you happy, well money can solve most of my problems and most importantly I feel it will give my the confidence to truly be myself around people. I feel so bad that im such a disappointment to my family that Im scared to even show my face. Its hard to have or be with friends with no confidence in myself because Im not sure of myself and I have no confidence. I feel worthless, useless."
Everything hurts,1007,dj5z5e,64,"My heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.

Had a massive panic attack last night with my S.O next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. I cried, said 'help me' multiple times. I can’t do this to him. He doesn’t deserve it.

Now I feel numb. I don’t care about anything. I don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, I don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. 

If it wasn’t for my parents and my S.O I would have ended it last night. 

The worst part? I thought I was done being miserable. My last months were happy and bright. I felt good. 

But after last night, I feel like nothing has changed and I‘m in the exact same spot again.
Those panic attacks scare the shit out of me.

"Fuck life, fuck being awake.",1006,kkl03e,56,"I'm honestly angry that I'm still alive, why cant I just fucking die already? Life is nothing but endless suffering anyway, theres no point in living."
I sold my guns.,1005,a6qv8n,68,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

Does anyone else’s depression make them feel dumb? Or...unable to focus on school work or semi difficult tasks?,1007,9oiz3s,87,"Information in class is difficult to obtain. As I’m usually having anxiety attacks and trying to talk myself down. If not that I’m just mindlessly taking notes. Not really focused on what my professor is saying. When I look at a question it makes my head hurt. Literally. I just want to put crumble the paper, shut my laptop screen, and lie down. As a matter of fact I don’t want to do anything but stay in my room. It has a full bathroom attached so my favorite thing to do is shower and watch Netflix.

I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,1007,blpehw,163,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this."

I’m literally having a breakdown every night,1003,fti8nr,101,I’m literally bawling my eyes out every single day over how much i hate my life and becoming very suicidal. I cant do this anymore
Is life only about distracting myself until I die?,998,km202k,73,"So it's been like that for 5 years, and I've been telling myself over, and over again that it would get better with time, but I dont think anymore that it will, nor do I know if I'd actually want it to be better. The whole covid thing made it way harder to distract myself as much as I did before, which made me realise how my life really looked like. Is there really a point in living a life, in which I only look to the things that happened in the past, and ignore the present day as well as the future? Is this really what my life have become?"

"Anyone else find that, while you're super hard on yourself, you're almost too forgiving of others?",1006,8dfi1b,67,"In my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that I'm worthless but that other people still have worth. I also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. Because of this, I can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. But with myself, nothing is good enough. Every decision I make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence. 

Are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth?"
Casually suicidal?,1001,92t7kh,142,"Is anyone else “casually suicidal”? Like, you’re perfectly okay with the idea of dying and it’s just an average lingering thought part of your daily thought process. It’s more like thinking of ways to kill yourself rather than actually acting on them."

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen.

Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR: a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.],989,8kybap,125,"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. 
At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. "

Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take.  I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.  I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff.  I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.  Nothing is interesting to me either, so I am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal.  I just want something to live for, and for life not to be so lonely anymore.."
Depression is physically painful,991,fozmk5,97,It literally hurts to live
You can never have an honest conversation about suicide,983,8lnteu,96,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm. 

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. 

It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. 

When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. 

At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. "

This sucks."
This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:,991,22jqpo,106,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."""
Did your anxiety give you depression or am I just fucked.,985,ij3ko2,80,"My anxiety makes me care too much until I don’t care at all and I fluctuate between the two. How can I stop this? Depression is quickly starting to win the battle against me😶

Any advice or coping mechanisms?"
I can’t stand it anymore. I’m committing suicide. This is my story. Being good and positive won’t help u stop suffering.,984,eophbs,236,"Why does this happen to me.

Honest to god I hate my life so much. I’m a 16 year boy.I try to make every negative thing positive but it doesn’t works. So much has happen to me in the last year. My parents and sister passed away in an accident last year, I don’t if I should feel bad since they’ve tortured me mentally and physically my whole life. I never though much of it. But once my uncle raped me at 6, and told me to shut up or he’ll kill me. When I came of age I found out the truth. I revealed it to. My parents, who tried to get me arrested for being mentally ill. Just because they wanted to save face. But what has happened happened . I escaped the morning after they found out and tortured me to shut up(same night they tried to get me arrested). I escaped and entered foster care when I was 13/14 .I’m in my last year in high school. I have my gcse and I can’t study with due to the time limit my carer has given me and it just doesn’t work because the house is far from my school so it takes long to travel. I travel for 4 hours(mostly walking)(it’s 7.4 miles, however I take multiple bus routes and walk for an hour).4 hours there and back. So that meant I had 8 hours to sleep or study.So I barely get any chance to revise. Especially since I know I’m smart (I got straight 7s ‘A’ in my mocks before this unfolded). So it’s so frustrating since I didn’t do too well in my last mock, due to my parents death a few days before my 2nd mocks started, now I’m struggling to stay in my high sets. Then there’s my social life. As I said it’s hard to do anything since I live far my original town (around an hour away). Side track- I used to be really overweight but due me being bullied as a kid and then my crush making fun of Me, motivated me to lose weight, age 13(85kg) to age 14(51kg) which I was proud off. But that routine got destroyed due to me moving into foster. I gained weight and now I’m age 15, 2 months away from 16. (65kg). And one thing that annoys me is that my aunty could’ve taken my. She had a high paying job, but she didn’t want to take care of ‘kid’ ( she’s married and has a child). She was also a social worker. However I forgot to mention. It was this women, this women who I confided in. Someone I though was my hope. She was the one that betrayed me and told my parents about my uncle raping me and me wanting to move out when I turn 18. She betrayed me and made it seems as though I fabricated this lie so I could move out. She promised me to wait till I turned 18 so I had a choice in my life. But nope she couldn’t wait. First of all. I wasn’t the only one raped. 2 other kids were also raped by him. They both told my aunty. But to save face. They threatened the other two. Because they’re still 11. They’re more likely to listen. I didn’t. Therefore the reason I was tortured. I hate her with all my life. My only hope turned into my biggest disappointment. (Police gave up due to the lack of testimony, whole family conspired against me) In addition to my social life. As I mention I was bullied my whole childhood. I was a fat kid who didn’t know how to socialise. Becuz my parents always fought or let their frustration out on me. Mentally or physically. And because I wasn’t ‘popular’ , my ‘best friend’ pretended not to know me in school and then supposedly wants to always hang out with me when ever there wasn’t school. I was still naive then. He betrayed me twice in high school. I ended our friendship 2 years ago after the 2nd time I trusted him and he betrayed me. A few weeks after that I met a new person who was a really good friend. That was when his cousin wasn’t around. His cousin lied framed me racist comment(weird even though we’re the same race, but still I didn’t even say it, I proved it a week later when he posted the wrong screenshot since we had beef showing he said it first and all I did was say the same thing back).and what my friend did was support him. That infuriated me since I knew he was supporting him and sat next thing.what makes it even worse was that it was all on his phone. I didn’t end my friendship with this person, but I did drift off from him. I then met a person who was a genuine nice person. We had a good couple of months. But his parents were strict so we couldn’t hang out much and we’ve kinda drifted off but he is still someone I would trust. I also met another genuine person. He was a new kid. And he is now my best friend, I think. It was weird because I never expected it to happen since he was popular I was just well a student.. even we’re close and talk quiet a bit. But I always feel uncomfortable with him, he never answers me with full sentences, doesn’t talk to me when we’re with out group of friends. But I do know he cares for me as a friend. But a lot of the time I think that if it was purely up to him and by date of chance that we say next to each other. Is that he never would’ve bothered speaking to me. In fact he’s probably the only one that would actually hang out with me in our group of friends. The thing our group of friends aren’t like friend but just nice people in my perspective.its like we’re friends only when the other person is here( if u get what I mean). It honestly is so fucked up me. I only have. What like a month to my gcse and all I. Am is depressed, down, I have never once been happy this year. Actually that was a life. The only thing that makes me happy is anime. I’ve developed an anime addiction ever since age 8. This was originally due to my parents fighting and arguing so I went upstairs to watch movies until I stumbled onto anime. The only good thing I can think of is that in 2 mo the I turn 16 which means I’ll be able to rent a flat thanks to my social workers. I’ll be in a new town (in a new school( I’ll be in college) and I’ll be able to start a fresh start. But still looking how my life is. It feels like I’m meant to have a hard life. It doesn’t help that I’m an atheist because that means I’m not able to rely on someone with 100% belief. I’ve never had a true true friend, my education is pretty much ruin, I’m literally on my own( my carer only cares about the money and my social worker can’t find any more placements). It’s so fucking frustrating. Honestly is it just that some people have a hard life. I’ve sacrificed so many hours of sleep that my heights been affected and that I’ve dozed of many time on the bus.i just can’t care anymore. All I want now is to become rich and take over the world. Without Any selfish desires, I just want to truly make this world better. Because it doesn’t look like anyone is gonna help me. I’ve tried, got hurt...many times and all for what.



Edit: half a year later into now January 2020(in my first year of college). My life has gone worse. I’m not in the mood to explain it. somehow, somehow it’s gone worse. Ive been diagnosed with metal health disorder. And no one understands me. They have bad view of me. And when I try to explain. They place their authority over me and won’t let me talk. Especially when I have facts. My social life hasn’t changed. My genuine friend with strict parents. Guess what happened. You would have never would’ve guessed🙄he spread rumours about my personal life and left me for another person. I’ve gained weight. I’m back to my weight before my weight loss. I’m now again 85kg. I didn’t get into the course I wanted in college becuz I was a grade behind. The works easy, but I can’t seems to concentrate. I zone out when the teacher scolds. Even though I really do want to listen. I do want to try. I’ve been having mental breakdowns pretty much everyday.I’ve been debating over the last few months to either take the drug and deep it’s effect. Even though my studies will fail more than it already has or overdose and commit suicide. I’m lost. I’m hopeless. I’ve got no one for me. I’m no one number one. I’m alone. I got literally nothing  to lose. And no one benefits from me being alive. It I’ve had enough of this bullshit life in this bullshit world. I have bad luck. There’s no desputing that. It is what it is. I’m committing the act on my birthday which is in June.. to a certain extent. This is kinda funny. Who would’ve though life could get this shitty at such a young age for kid born in a good area. Who would’ve though, not trying to sound pessimistic but I was genuinely kind and generous to all my friends and everyone I meet would suffer like this. The good guy gets nothing. Wow even I cringed when I said that. Whatever happens in June happens. If I do commit. I’d at least want someone to know my story. And if they meet someone like me. Please I beg with all my life, help him. The one thing I wish I had. Was someone who understood. Someone who didn’t listen because they had but they wanted to. Someone who wouldn’t try to tell me to look at the positive but actually help.  Someone who would’ve been my hero. Thank you for reading. This is KU/KW(before I changed my name and after initials) 14/6/2020✌️


Sorry I should’ve mentioned it. I’m in my second half on year 13. College.  I failed my GCSE. I didn’t get enough sleep. I ran away during one exam and all the others I couldn’t concentrate. I kept zoning out. I didn’t get into my a level classes. I haven’t made any new friends. My anxiety hasn’t lessened.in fact my social life has gone far worse.im finding it hard to keep up with all things pain I feel mentally."
"I hate it when people say that people self harm or talk about killing themselves just to get attention. Of course they want attention, they need HELP.",984,5xwh2m,106,How else are you supposed to get help if no one knows?
I don't enjoy being... human,983,lsb7t3,89,"Also I'm not intrested in jumping into the void (death) either. I'm scared of non-existence. I want to live or... I just want to exist. Observe. Not participating in the world, just watching people from ghost-like perspective. I don't like doing stuff. I just want to watch, or swim in the ocean of warmth untill I'll get better.

I'm poor, always have been, no rich parents. My parents are poor and abusive. Never went to college, but it's not a big deal for anyone (I hate myself for that, but I've been too depressed to study anything, also I failed my finals and I only have hs degree).  I've been struggling with anxiety and depression since I was 12. I'm 22 now. I had a really f up childhood and adolescence, so much traumatic experience, I can't even count them all. Extreme poverty, loneliness, lack of friends etc. Six years spent in theraphy for nothing, at least we've got free healthcare, lol. Talking about obvious things is not for me I guess. I was a patient on a mental ward also - no one could help me. Meds - same, and I've tried too many. I just don't like being human, it's not for me. And there is no escape from it. There is death or... this life. 

For me, the only way to stop being poor is to work my ass off at some low-income job and saving some money. And then what? Considering, that I don't even have power to work so much. I'm not from US, I know that things are different there. I'm too exhausted to work and I don't see the point. I even skipped work today first time in months. I dont' have the power to educate myself anymore. 

You see, human life is... boring. And these parts of life that are considered not boring are really expensive or not that cool after all. I'm intrested in supernatural (even tho I don't believe in this kind of stuff) since I was a child because being human truly sucks. Working, working, working. Eating, fucked up boring activities, working, mundane job.  And even these things that I like... I don't see the point in doing them. I used to like writing in my native language, but right now my head is like made of cement. Brain fog, being exhausted, lack of imagination. Years of stress and anxiety gave me a brain damage. Damn, I don't know even how to write this stuff without mistakes, even tho I understand English perfectly. I have no plans for my life, I won't ever get a degree, in my country if you're not working as an IT expert or a private doctor or a lawyer you earn nothing. I've got OCD, depression and various anxiety-related stuff.  In my country there is a cult of working your ass off.  If you're not doing it, then you're a loser and a lazy mother\*\*\*\*r and you deserve nothing. Also, you're poor.

Everything I like, even when I was a child, from music to movies, is about supernatural. About hazy dream state or abstract or surreal stuff. Demonic possesions, vampires, being trapped in a dream, dying and hallucinating - some of my favourite movies. I don't like life. I don't like being human. And I guess I'll never like it. No one will help me, I can only count on myself - and I'm too tired to do that. 

My body is failing, my back is twisted, I look like shit. I can't fix my skeleton. I hate my face. I hate human life, I don't enjoy human activites, even pleasant ones. I know it's depression, but it's also something deeper. Since I was born I felt that something is wrong, that I shouldn't be alive. That I shouldn't be human. If there is life after death, I'm gonna be so proud of myself that I survived (even tho I died, lol). 

I don't have plans for my life, because I'm broke, alone and without future. There is no future for someone who doesn't work, work, work, work That's reallity. So, I'm just gonna exist a bit longer, and then: who knows? Climate change? Suicide? War? Nothing? Just same ol' bs? 

I'm so lonely. I've got my bf, but he... He's not really into helping me, he's got his own problems and traumas. 

I'm trapped. I don't want to die. I don't want to live. Theraphy is not working, never worked for me I KNOW why I feel like that, meds are not working, my reallity is crushing me. It's all so boring, so... sad. It's not just how my life works, any other scenarios are completely impossible or just not exciting at all.     


I just hate being human. Sorry for my English, blah blah, I hope you'll understand everything."

What do people do to pass the time?,985,gnaqmv,231,"My attention span is close to zero, everything is horribly uninteresting. When I'm not feeling suicidal, I feel bored. Life is just an endless cycle of boredom for me, I wake up and instantly feel bored and depressed. I go through every day doing absolutely nothing. Sometimes I try to do something I used to enjoy like drawing or playing the guitar, but it changes nothing. It's incredibly boring and I stop after 10 minutes max because it's not worth it. Not even video games hold my attention anymore. All I do is eat, listen to music and watch Youtube until I can sleep again. 

I'm thinking of trying drugs but I don't know where to get any since I'm underage. Which is probably a good thing. I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'm considering ending it at this point."

"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...",974,3vce1n,80,"About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

Edit: Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)"
"Some people think depression/anxiety is just a way to get attention, but attention is the last thing I want. Just leave me alone and let me die.",977,7e0sus,70,

So fuck it. 

I'm depressed. I'm dealing with it in my own way. 
I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. 
I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. 

I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. 

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love."
"I feel like I'm right back where I was at the end of 2018, and I fucking hate it.",974,g6ac7h,44,"No love, no happiness, and nothing but the clothes on my back. Quarantine has been draining me and taking away literally everything that I had left that made me happy. Now, I can barely pull myself out of bed. I'd rather lay there and let the days fly by until something else happens. Preferably death.

Nothing is working for me, and I feel like I truly have nothing right now. Quarantine took my job away and left me unemployed. Unemployment insurance hasn't been coming in even after claiming it every week, so I have no money. I still have yet to receive any kind of stimulus check. My fitness has gone right back downhill, and I can't even get myself to do any basic exercise. The person I gave my heart to is still out there, doing...whatever she is doing in Colorado. All of my plans for this year have been steadily getting cancelled. I still live in a shithole area of the world, and have thought every single day about where I'd like to move to in order to escape this hell. And today I ran into the girl I saw months ago, and hoped to see again...and I couldn't even get myself to say hello.

This isn't the end of the world...but it feels so much like it. And I find myself wanting it to be the end. I didn't want much out of life, and I didn't get it..."
Anyone else feel like when they ask people for help that you are being a burden?,972,8ai20x,103,"This is definitely because of my anxiety, and I know that I really am not a burden to these people.

i don’t feel like i’m suicidal “enough” to warrant help but at the same time...,968,lc5nsw,54,"...every time i *do* feel suicidal it hits me like a ton of fucking bricks. like right now. my heart is telling me to go jump off the fire escape. the scene keeps replaying in my head while i lie in bed motionless and numb. 

i feel like a fake depressed person because i avoid my responsibilities and just play video games or do anything meaningless to fill time. it just makes me feel like a lazy person and i often think i’m just using my depression as an excuse to feel lazy and that i deserve the suicidal thoughts. 

i want to admit myself to inpatient but again, i feel like i’d just be taking up space as a fake depressed person. even though sometimes i really can’t stop thinking or fantasizing about killing myself. i just don’t want to experience the stress of school anymore. i lost all my friends. i’m also scared of leaving my partner to fend for themselves. and i don’t know if my school would even permit a leave of absence anyways. also covid, of course. every time i think about or try to do homework, my brain goes into suicide mode. even though i love learning and what i learn about. i’m so far behind in my classes. because maybe i’m just lazy and not actually depressed.

i don’t know it’s not like anyone will see this i just need to talk about it. i feel so nauseous.

small edit: i went to sleep last night and am only now checking reddit after class and i.. i’m so blown away by the supportive responses and the support offers i’ve gotten. when i said i thought no one would see this i genuinely meant it and so to be able to read everyone’s comments, even the ones of people who are in the same spot, it has given me more hope. i feel so warm and fuzzy inside. i felt i had lost all my friends to my depression and i haven’t felt this feeling in my chest in a while, and i can’t overstate how flattered i am, i would cry if i could. i’m gonna try to reply to people. you all really helped me last night and today. 

i woke up and it’s a bright, sunny day. i can hear the cars and the people outside. i’m still sad and unstable but i feel hope in my chest. so thank you. really. 🤍"

What depression isn't.,972,1hfqib,161,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life."

You don't get it,957,es440i,79,"""It gets better"" ""Stop thinking about it"" ""get over it"", etc.

Stop. Saying. That. 

I hate it as much as you do, I just want to be free from my mind. I am my worst enemy. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking bad, you have no idea, and I hate my situation, I hate my life and I am trying to control my emotions... It's **NOT** easy. 

Did you ever get in your car and thought: Huh, maybe this time I will die? And feel almost disappointed you haven't finished in a car crash?  
Have you ever crossed the road and almost got hit by a car and was like: Damn, it was close!

Started to cut vegetables, and thought about hurting yourself?  
Hang yourself? Fall off a bridge? 

There are honestly thousands of ways I could have ended my life, for many horrible reasons, my own demons eating me, my own anxiety taking the best of me and my depression taking away my self worth.  I feel like shit and like I don't deserve a place here and my loved ones deserve better. I am lost. I am alone. I feel horribly... horribly numb. 

*I just want to die....*"
Most people are not depressed and I can't comprehend that,954,j4ea27,42,"The fact that most people are not depressed, most people don't wish to die everyday is actually bewildering. Like I really have no idea how that is like... 


I'm not saying most people are productive or happy, but they're okay with being alive and want to live, they have a social life (maybe) and have enough mental power to do what needs to be done.


That's most people.... on the internet there are a lot of depressed folk like myself so it starts to feel normal. But it's not. And that's crazy to me.


In the last 2 years, not a single day went by without me wanting to kill myself, genuinely. For a long time the moment I wake up I feel... dread? No reason at all I can suddenly cry while doing things like exercising. Sometimes I can't cry at all. For the whole of today I've been on my bed, occasional tears but no crying, falling asleep and waking up feeling the worst. I have things to do ffs..."
I feel like I'm feeling less and less excited about stuff.,950,dq9jpv,68,Especially stuff that involves socializing or dealing with people
Does anyone else feel that people only “tolerate” you?,946,7soqgh,87,"I hate thinking this way. I have a few friends, but I’ve never felt I was truly “in” the group.  We “hang out” together, but most of the conversations would be other people talking. Sometimes I wonder if they only take advantage of me because I would try my hardest not to lose them so I won’t be alone. 

Do they really enjoy being around me? Do they like me? I wonder...if I should find new people. But i don’t want to be alone.

Edit: waved hi to a friend. She completely ignored me. :/"
Does anyone else feel like depression has lowered their intelligence over the years?,951,4giqej,150,"I feel like after years of being depressed I've become worse at everything I try to do, I used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. When I'm studying I'l forget everything and even when I'm focused on reading I almost feel like I'm just staring at a blank page. 

No matter what I do I can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more I feel like I'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting."
I feel like I’m not as important in other people’s lives as they are in mine,955,9w4tvh,64,"I have very few friends, and even then I’m not really close to them. It’s VERY hard for me to make friends, and even harder to open up to them. I know they have plenty of other friends they’re much closer to and it wouldn’t really make much of a difference if I disappeared. Meanwhile, if they disappeared from my life, I would pretty much have no one. I just wish I really mattered to someone."
Completely dead inside,948,k7rjj7,99,"I feel no real happiness or pleasure anymore. Nothing feels good not food, sex, music, TV and movies, physical touch, socializing, it all does nothing. I lay in bed all day endlessly browsing reddit and YouTube watching the same videos over and over desperately looking for something to fill the emptiness. I don't even remember what real happiness or a normal life feels like anymore. To me, if I'm not feeling absolutely awful, I'm in a good spot. I've resorted to taking an endless amount of drugs and supplements in order to feel some kind of joy, but that's had a ton of disastrous effects on my life. Anyone else feel the same?"
Why do I feel like everyone secretly strongly dislikes me?,948,ecjjmm,52,"No matter how good a conversation goes, I always end up so depressed and crying because I feel like everyone has a real deep hatred towards me. Especially if I did something ‘embarrassing’...

Any advice?"
Hospital bills after suicide attempt,954,5s9cde,189,"I attempted suicide about three years ago, and I'm still struggling to pay the hospital bills. Yesterday, I received a bill for a charge I didn't even know about.

It just doesn't make any sense. I wanted to be dead, but they forced me to stay alive, and now I have to pay them for it. Plus I have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again. I feel like I'm literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills. 

Why couldn't they let me just die?"
"Anyone else basically waste all their time on reddit, youtube video games, discord, youtube etc etc all day ?",951,6nr6ff,163,
I took a shower for the 2nd day a row :),945,c3j71n,93,"It might not be much to most others, but it’s a pretty big deal for me. I normally go weeks with showering properly…"
"I created my first reddit because my boyfriend was drowning in his depression, and I wanted desperately to help him. Since then, I've gained more insight and listened to all you beautiful people and because of you, I've learned how to better help him.",947,848frx,45,"I'm not sure if this is right right place to post this, and I hope I don't upset anyone. (this is my second acct by the way, I wanted to create a new one yesterday for personal reasons) but the title pretty much says everything. I wanted to thank each one of you for being vulnerable with your feelings and helping one another, as you've helped me help the man I love. I hope nothing but the best for each of you and I hope this means something to someone. "
Has anybody else been mentally ill for so long now that sometimes you don't even realize how bad it is anymore?,944,63s6rl,161,
"This is horrible, but... Does anyone fantasize about ending up in the hospital, being bedridden for a while?",939,5wxsq6,184,"I picture myself finally being able to believe that my friends and family care about me after seeing their concerned faces upon visits. 

I picture myself finally having a shift in perspective which makes me grateful for the life that I have.

I picture myself finally being able to do what I want- to stay in bed all day with no responsibilities.

I picture my ex visiting me, and us finally able to work it out because my damaged health made us realize how short life is.."
Unemployed Therapist,940,e0k42b,78,"I’m a therapist- but recently lost my job to my depression. It was a personal choice, but I felt that everyone I worked with wanted me to leave. I have severe issues with self-doubt. I feel like a fraud, like my MSEd is not legit, I didn’t deserve to graduate magna cum laude.

My family is financially supportive when I need them but not much else. My mom just tells me to take my meds (I do), or she offers me her meds. I told my sister earlier this year that I was feeling suicidal and she basically said, “between you and my cheating husband I’m going to go insane!”

My own husband is patient but not very supportive. I’ve been on the couch since Monday and he has been operating as normal, working, going into the office, never stopping to ask how I am. I know he wants me to return to “normal”. I worry he’ll give up on me.

I interviewed for another job last week and this week. It was an adoption counselor position, something I’ve always dreamt of. I did both interviews disguising my severely depressed state with smiles and makeup. I didn’t get the job. 

While still working, I found a therapist- in hopes of getting the support I needed to keep working and to be a good therapist myself. I made the mistake of telling her that I smoke weed sometimes. She then began questioning my work and my physical health. She also felt my main goal should be to get off meds (40 mg Prozac), as I was somehow “putting my health at risk”. Needless to say, I plummeting deeper into depression.

I spoke to my PCP and he prescribed me an antipsychotic. After two days, I was so sick I had to stop the new meds and see my doctor again. When I asked to try something different, he told me “pills aren’t going to make you happy.”

I guess I feel hopeless and alone. I have two little boys who are 3 and 6. My oldest son has severe special needs. I am able to take care of them, but I cannot get off the couch to do anything else. My body hurts, I can’t eat anything. My husband and kids went to breakfast and I stayed home to watch TV in my pajamas.

I feel a bit like I’m already dead, and that nobody cares enough about me to try and help me."
Anyone else take days to recover from a insult?,938,8uuvkg,110,"Every fucking time... first I ignore it and just brush it off then it pops back in my head and I'm stuck on it for days it eats away at me.. I manifest the insult and let it define me. The most common one is a insult to my intelligence, every time it happens I'm fucked up for a week."
Attempted suicide last night. Now I'm being guarded 24/7 by police officers.,933,6pgoal,204,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. 


Thank you all for your comments and love <3

Lots of love,

Anyone else feels like they would actually be someone if they were not held back by psychological problems?,934,5f5hea,147,"Like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.
At the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.
When i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.
Not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.
I think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (Yay free shit.)



Edit: It's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, I really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :)."
I’m depressed and can’t bring myself to date other people,934,jlhswo,77,"I (F23) was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety a year ago, but it’s been going on for at least 7-8 years. Since I’ve been diagnosed I take medication and go to therapy. As a teen I was in a serious relationship with a guy (now M23) once, were 2.5 years together but I finally broke up with him 6 years ago since he belittled me, put me down constantly, used to laugh at me crying (which I did every day at the end), be annoyed when I needed help (I have endometriosis, severe phobia and sometimes I get panic attacks if the phobia triggers me) and so on. (I know a relationship couldnt really be serious since I was 17 but the long term damage it did is definitely serious). Guy was also a legit genius and I still have to hear about his new papers or something from mutual acquaintances. 
Since than, I haven’t really been dating, I’ve tried tinder numerous times but since I always only swipe right on guys I don’t feel threatened by, I usually don’t get past the first date (if at all) because I can’t bring myself to write back. I am conflicted, since as you can see, I’m the whole “won the health lottery and also I’m miserable” package and I don’t want to put this on anyone. I also have next to none sexual experience and no sex drive since I’ve started taking antidepressants. Still, I’m just lonely.
(I think it’s also important for you to know that I’m working to be a professional in a medical field and my program takes long hours and  is extremely hard and stressful, which doesn’t really help. I have 2 more years to go.)

So my question to you guys is : was someone here in a similar situation? How did you get out? I’ve been single for over 6 years now and I desperately want someone to connect with but no matter how hard I try I can’t really get out of my small lonely bubble and I know I don’t have much to offer. There is definitely more than enough guys who would want me for my body but that’s not an arrangement I’d personally be comfortable with right now. I don’t know what to do but I’m getting more and more frustrated and sad by the day, and that’s been going on for at least 2 years now. 

Sorry for the long post and thanks for reading if you’ve gotten this far!"

People wonder why depressed or suicidal people don’t get help,940,byjnm7,64,"When I was four years old, my family was going to leave our country to live in the United States. They abandoned everything so my brother and I could live a good life. How am I supposed to tell the people to gave up everything, worked every single day, learned an entire language through just talking to others, and moved away from their loved ones for me to have a good life, that I don’t even want my life anymore? How am I supposed to tell them I don’t want to live the life they wanted for me anymore? How am I supposed to tell them that? It would break their heart. It would break everyone’s heart. 

I can’t do that to them."
"Today my depression won, I dropped out of college",932,awewhm,115,"My depression won today, I couldn’t keep going as I was. I thought I could handle it, I really did. I was excited to study my major, but I couldn’t handle it. I started missing classes, forgetting to take proper care of myself. My room became a mess, and so did my grades.

My parents are coming down tomorrow to pack my things up and bring me home, they’re going to get me the help I need, going to keep me under their supervision. I feel guilty as hell for wasting so much money and time for college when I knew I could never handle it with the way things are. My heart feels like it’s in my throat, my head feels like it’s stuffed with cotton. 

I’m going to have to quit my job and find a new one once I get home. At least I’ll try to find something to keep me sociable and busy during the day. "
Anyone else's depression hit the hardest at night?,929,acrqhi,112,"Maybe it's just me, but I feel like the silence of every night is a reminder of how alone I feel. "
"If someones willing to read this, itd make my night.",929,8t7rjv,67,"Coming from an already broken heart:
Okay, so. Yesterday was prom. I care about the girl i went with so much and were kind of talking too. she knows i deal with anxiety depression insomnia and some other shit. anyway. everyone got up at prom and started dancing. this freaked me the fuck out dor whatever reason. i really really felt like i was going to break down so i went outside and walked around. turns out i didnt have the willpower to go back inside with everyone dancing and shit. i was out there for 3 hours by myself, and the occasional teacher coming out to check on me which made me feel even worse. eventually i went back in just because i felt so fucking bad for not dancing with her and i just hung out with her on the dance floor. eventually prom ended, she was happy , and i wasnt. We went to afterprom and were sitting down together on a bench. i end up getting so tired im literally falling asleep. she reaches over and puts her arm around my waist and kissed by head and like rubbed me in an affectionate way. i looked at her and i hugged her so hard because thats literally one of the nicest things anyone has ever done me and one of the happiest moments of my life. prom is over now and i havent heard from her since and its making me super sad, and i know i only have 2 more months with her bc of college... i really dont know why this makes me so upset but it seriously does

Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. For anyone asking, i did text her yesterday. She didnt open my text and still hasnt this morning. Kind of confused.

Update: She is super busy and i will hear back from her tonight."
I want someone to catch me secretly crying,934,ixyc8i,58,"DAE fantasize about being found crying and having someone ask them what is wrong. And even when you say Nothing they still probe it out of you. 
I hate asking for help. I hate being seen as needy. But how I wish someone would stumble upon me, I wouldn’t feel so guilty."
Depression is addicting,926,f8eddm,68,"Why does it always feel easier to live in this discomfort than being happy. I get better and always feel myself coming back to this state.

It’s like my mind is tricking me into thinking being depressed is easier. Any time something remotely bad happens I think, well I can always kill myself if it gets worse.

Life is overwhelming me. I need help."
I’m going to end my life soon.,926,esbfsf,319,"People have been nice to me and tried to help, but it doesn’t really work. Nothing really works, because I’m a bad fucked up person. It’s okay though... I won’t be here much longer. I’m just sort of confused on how to tell everyone and how it will feel to hang myself. I don’t know... I’m scared. But it’s much better than living. I will tell all my friends goodbye soon anyways... I think everyone will be able to get through it. It’s not that big of a deal when you really think about the bad person I am. I know I said it a million times but for real this time. I’m ready to do it. I’ve been broken a lot, but this time I can feel that it’s the last thing to break. Usually I’m open to compassion from others but not this time. I feel fixed on dying and I don’t want help. I don’t care anymore really. I don’t want to talk about it anymore or make any online friends anymore or anything fucking thing. I realized I have to do it. I knew for a while it was my destiny but I was too scared to do it. But it’s better to die now then suffer from suicidal thinking for 10-20 years and just feel even more worse things. If I can’t handle this what can I handle.... and to everyone that was mean to me or is just a piece of shit I hate them so much . I jsut have so much hate. I’d really like to hurt myself

Edit: I’m trying to reply to everyone but it’s a lot. Sorry if I don’t reply to you. I appreciate the comments though.

Depression is like being in an abusive relationship with your own brain.,925,5c46vm,56,
"If you get a PM from someone claiming that religion with cure your depression, please click ""report"" and then ignore it!",921,1ywyvt,175,"It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to ""save"" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click ""report"" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.  Don't forget that if you need help and don't feel safe posting, you're always welcome to message the moderators. "

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. "
