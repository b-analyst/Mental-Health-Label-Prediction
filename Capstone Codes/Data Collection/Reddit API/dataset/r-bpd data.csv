i am ruining my reputation at my job,1,mlr17t,0,"i work a restaurant minimum wage job, and it’s been having a strain on my mental health. i feel that i am being taken advantage of and i’m starting to have a hard time controlling my emotions at work. every time i try to talk to my manager about how i feel i’m always shut down with how much more she has to do for the store and how much longer she works. i understand she deals with a lot but i am not a manager and i didn’t sign up to fill in the gaps for everyone else. the worst part is that i’ve began thinking that i can only function at work if i’m on drugs which has led me back to abusing my adhd medication. 
i’m so upset all of the time at my job. i don’t enjoy it at all and i don’t know what to do. i know it’s minimum wage but it’s what’s paying the bills right now and i don’t have a place to go yet. but i don’t even know if it’s my job that’s the issue or if i’m just making it seem worse than it actually is. i’m worried that one day i’m not going to be able to control myself and i’m just going to walk out and regret everything.
it’s so exhausting trying to put on a good face for people that i don’t give a single shit about."
Can I ever be loved in the same way?,2,mlr0am,1,"Seriously though? Can someone ever love me in the same way I love them? Or am I just doomed to always be the one in love? Like it's hurtful to realize they just don't feel the same and you have to accept that reality. I don't want to accept that reality because it means that I'm unwanted, unlovable. I don't want to live in that reality because it just fucking sucks. I will always just be some things people lives that they tolerate and get replaced later. It's unfortunate but that is apparently my role in others lives."
DAE feel like they don’t ever know how they truly feel?,3,mlqrum,0,"Whenever I split I feel so trapped in each viewpoint that I can be completely aware I will be trapped in the opposing viewpoint in no time but still cannot *feel* any differently in the moment; it’s torture. 

So which do I actually believe? Do I actually love them or hate them? Do I just feel both? Why can’t I see both sides at once? What is the difference between thought and feeling here? What is my true feeling if I can split and feel either/or so intensely?

I hope this post made some sense, I’m so frustrated with this disorder and having trouble understanding myself. I would pay big money for my thoughts and actions to be driven by fact and logic instead of emotion at this point."
DAE take FOREVER to get over an ex?,4,mlqhbe,3,"Bit of a rant here

Let me start out by saying I'm NOT like this with every guy. This in regards to someone you have an emotional attachment to and feel an attachment hunger for.

Its coming up on a year since my ex broke up with me. He's a PA. He went through my since deleted account after i specifically told him I wasn't comfortable with him looking at all of it. Its my fault for thinking I could trust him in the first place. We had sex and while I was asleep he went through my account. Reading things in regards to BPD I don't even remember writing. 

I had deleted the account after the initial encounter, my reason being if i was so concerned about him finding it I shouldn't have it. Unaware he'd already gone through it.

I've been in non consensual sexual situations. Ive had people I trusted betray me. I've been violated in many ways. This was something I've never experinced before. On a psychological, interpersonal, intellectual...and Idk what all other levels.

I'm so truamatized. Yet part of me still feels desperate for his attention. I wanted a different ending to the story, any ending where I'm not left feeling unwanted and abandoned.

Even worse. I haven't the motivation to go out and meet new people. If anything I'm simply terrified of getting hurt again. I feel abandoned and feeling abandoned makes me feel worthless and feeling worthless makes me feel like I want to act out in self destructive ways. Everytime he ignored me it validated that sense of worthlessness.

I know he never got off his multiple dating apps and had me replaced in a matter of days. I'm still sitting here a year later broken. Trapped in a past that doesn't care about me anymore. Feeling worthless over somebody I dont even want to be with forever, but him discarding me still hurts all the same. 

I want to cry. I feel pathetic. I haven't engaged in self harm since July. Even if I were to give into that urge it wouldn't change anything. Id feel worse, he wouldn't care. I don't think it will come to that. I just hate feeling this way. 

I feel so abandoned and it makes me feel so worthless and theres nothing i can do about it in regards to him. Why does my entire self worth have to revolve around somebody I don't even really like??? Part of me just wanted him to prove me wrong and be nice like he was in the very beginning but that never happened.

Thanks to anyone still reading. I think I just want to feel seen and heard instead of holding all of this in like I have been."
How do you deal with your S/O liking hot girls pictures on instagram?,1,mlq9cf,1,"it makes me feel so inadequate, and it makes me have a BPD spiral every-time.... i’ve been cheated on and my ex did things like this and it turns out he cheated on me during the entire relationship.  (Even though my current bf is nothing like my ex, and I know he loves me)

I don’t want to bring it up to him because I don’t want him to know i’m crazy and was stalking but it really bothers me ):"
Euphoria Scarier Than Depression,1,mlq3q2,0,"Dunno if this is how anyone else feels, but I would much rather have depression than euphoria. At least with depression I feel ""attached"" to my thoughts and actions, with euphoria I feel like moving through quicksand trying to connect and feel grounded. Depression is thinking dark thoughts, but euphoria is thinking those same thoughts while staring off into space for hours with a smile on your face. Depression and anxiety is being afraid of intrusive thoughts, euphoria is laughing at them but still believing them to be true. 

It took me years to learn that my body's natural reaction to severe sleep deprivation is a euphoric state, rather than irritable. All it takes for me is less sleep, more sunlight, and too much caffeine and I might as well be high on something. And it's scary as hell to think about the the patterns and decisions we make in our lives without even being aware that there's something not quite right in our brains."
I told a friend,1,mlpz22,2,I told a friend that I had bpd and explained how I usually automatically put up a personality for everyone for them to like me or like a reflection of that other person’s personality and they called me fake and they haven’t talked to me and wont anymore.
Hopeless Love,3,mlpnjg,2,"Does anyone else feel like no one will ever love you the way you love them? That you will never find that partner and your life will just be sad? I feel this way and sometimes I feel like there’s no point to anything if that’s the case. Just unmotivated because I don’t have someone to depend and love. Someone that can make me feel loved the way I want to make them feel loved.

It’s sucks that I can’t live properly without that special someone."
Stuff I feel,2,mlpi2o,0,"Sometimes I read through symptom lists and feel horribly, horribly guilty, to my core, for having BPD (I'm not diagnosed but I have been suspecting it with increasing strength and frequency since 2019.) But then I remember that it's really not my fault in any true way, and was probably due to a duo of abusive, neglectful parents who could NEVER come out of themselves and truly love me. It always feels like something died inside of me because of this semihuman early life. I was on acid a few months ago and realised that this, combined with the fact they don't speak the same native language as me (this is immensely frustrating and actually legitimately damaging to development imo) and vice versa, meant that *there were and are no feedback loops between me and them*. 

I mean, imagine any sensible thing you say being met with a confused face and a ""huh? I don't understand"", or stonewalling as per my dad. I've read studies on how FUCKED UP the latter is, too. 

My point is, it's weird having your emotional life sort of fucking ruined by something adults could have prevented but you personally had 0 control over. I'm rotting in jail, life sentence, for a crime others committed. At least I have the freedom to make my jail comfy. 

Anyway, I feel most at peace when I'm doing random shit around the house and cooking or cleaning. I don't live on a diet of love... just comfort and stability. I feel most at peace when things are nice and calm. 

I think I've realised in the past few weeks that everyone just gotta make do with their psychic construction and it's futile and agonizing trying to aim for perfect psychological health. Why? 

From 14 I knew I had problems with being able to love, and this tortured me for years. But why do I torture myself for something I can barely control, and why do I even want to be able to love in the first place, exactly...? Why? Why do anything? 

I don't want kids. I don't think I'm, at least as of now, capable of romantic love at all. I don't have enough within me for anything more in the long term future probably than friends, a casual bf and a pet. Anything more than that and I'll get real fucking destructive- but this amount of and distance of relationships seems like it will be a possible equilibrium for me.

There is no point trying for further. It's not my fault I have this condition. I value my own peace of mind first and foremost and I disagree with the mainstream pressures to always aim for the theoretical best (because it makes you feel guilt af you're not there or aiming for it) when I have been left emotionally foundationless. 

I feel like I don't owe it to anyone to live my life in such a way that could be looked up to by others, whereas I have felt this pressure in the past. I think there is a quiet virtue in living the best life you can for your circumstances that are out of your control. 

But at the same time I also feel like I'm giving up on life and love and being loved. Like I'll decay if I ignore emotions and relationships and retreat into my own little world. Like it'll feel like escaping reality and living a lie and pretending death isn't real. 

But maybe it's not as hard as I think. Argh... I'll hand it over to my therapist. I have no idea."
What are some tips to step away when you start to feel an episode begin?,1,mlp7hs,0,"I (23F) have a bad habit of blowing up at my BF (25M) we’re long distance and I always will text super fast without thinking during episodes when I’m triggered by something he does. 

Is it as simple as bringing my phone upstairs to my room and leaving it there? Or is there something else I can do also to relax my mind and let the feelings pass so I don’t do any further damage to my relationship? 

It’s to the point where he can’t take my episodes any longer and I feel like I have no self control. 

Therapy hasn’t been helping, and my DBT doesn’t start until next month."

Does anyone else wonder why their SO is still with them?,10,mloy52,5,"My BPD has been flaring for about a month, and I truly don't understand how my husband could still love me/hasn't left me. I'm not mean to him at all, but I need constant reassurance, and we always are talking about our relationship and my goddamn stupid ~fEeLinGS~. It must be so tiring for my husband and get so old, but he just keeps telling me all day every day that he loves me. I don't understand it, but I am so thankful.

I'll be so happy when I can pull myself out of this spell. It seems to happen spontaneously and resolve in much the same way, so I'm trying to ride it out as best I can. I don't have access to DBT because all the therapists are too expensive. I see one at Catholic Charities who isn't trained in DBT."
Agh why do i hate some people for no reason?,2,mlowa7,0,"So i started a new job this week and so far it's been pretty hard but i'm managing as best i can and my hours are good so i'm keeping positive. But there's this manager at work and she is ALWAYS there during my shifts, I hate her so much. I have no idea why because she is relatively friendly to me, she even trained me. But I hate her and her presence triggers such bad anger and anxiety for me. Why do I feel like this? And also if you ever felt like that, how do you cope with it or what do you tell yourself to make yourself like the person more?"
Working on myself and hoping I won’t be a burden to my future partner,4,mlok4i,3,"I know it’s not a healthy mindset but I feel like if I’m not harsh on myself I won’t do what I need to do to help myself make my situation any better. 

I just want to be loved, and validated. 

Everyone who knows this tells me to love myself. 

I don’t know how to do that. I try to do what’s good for me, cut out what’s bad for me, look after myself, don’t let people mistreat me. I feel better about myself. But inside me there’s this sobbing, crying child that just wants a hug. And feels so alone. And I just want somebody to see that child and to love them. Because I can’t.

Every day I go through the storm alone and come out of the other end. I try to be strong. I rarely give up. And even when I do I know giving up isn’t the way. So I get back up. But I just hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Because I’m so tired of walking alone."
"What to do when the doctors won’t screen you for BPD again even though you’ve been diagnosed with it before, and you’re really suffering from divergent behavior patterns?",1,mlohnk,1,"I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. Then I got another diagnosis whereafter the BPD diagnosis got invalid according to the doctors. Now they won’t examine/screen me for BPD again, but I’m pretty certain that I have it as almost all the symptoms match. I’m really suffering from major mood swings, anger outbursts and weird behaviors such as screaming at my husband over the phone and throwing soda in his garage because he was out with his friends and I was scared that he was with other girls. I know I’m crossing a line, but I can’t control it which is why I consider myself to have divergent behavior patterns. This is just one example out of many. What should I do in this situation?"
whats going on,1,mlog9y,0," 

so my partner has been off with me for weeks but she says she is just stressed and worried about everything but hardly talks to me about stuff and just says shes fine when you can clearly see shes not.

I keep trying to make plans and the best i get is a maybe, like it would be nice to know what i am doing etc.

the main thing is today, she blanks me for hours then tells me to shush every time i message her while shes out with her friends, yet she is constantly on her phone when she is around me, like rather than tell me she is busy she just tells me to shush and then ignores me when i ask why.

idek i just needed to rant. I want things to work out but im getting the feeling that she is pulling away."
Does anyone else not understand themselves ? One minute I’m head over heels for someone the next I’m repulsed :/,8,mlo89u,4,"I don’t know how to even explain this because I’m such a confusing person.

Abilify (Ariliprazole) for emotional/rejection sensitivity?,0,mlo4gs,1,"A couple days ago I (19F) was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and they prescribed me Abilify.

I’ve been taking 5mg for that past 2 days, but I’m looking forward to things not hurting me anymore.

Well meaning friends upset with my isolation.,2,mlnyvw,0,"Last week was pretty bad for me. I got in a fight with my family which ended up in me going on a pretty bad drug binge. Worse than normal. Ive been off my meds for years. I'm just trying to hold it together until I see my new doctor on the 26th. 

In order to keep my job and extension my home, I've been staying home and watching TV. I also keep up with my chores. Most of my friends understand this. But my newer friends can't seem to grasp it no matter how I explain it. Recovering this time around has been way more difficult than any episode I've had previously. Does anyone have advice on explaining this? I try my best but I guess I appear high enough functioning to where me explaining just doesn't land for them. It's a sad ugly existence. I can't help that solitude is the only thing that keeps it together for me. My biggest fear is ending up jobless and homeless."
The big empties,1,mlns16,0,"Hey frands,

Im trying to figure out what’s going on when I get the empties—you know the feeling.

I think it might have something to do with a lack of connection and validation. Possibly a lack of continuity and security—a lack of the sense that I am understood, loved, valued, safe—that I am standing on solid ground. 

I wonder if it’s not the ground that needs to be solid, but me that has to be ready for it to drop out, and know I’m gonna be ok, that I can handle it without help from anyone. 

I came up with this thing re: a sense of self, informed by some reading, my own experiences and the input of my fabulous therapist: 

Agency: Capable, confident and competent: a sense that I am going to be able survive, thrive, meet my goals, that i am valid, worthy, competent and capable

Validation: a sense that I am valid, loved and understood; sense that there are people who love me, that not just my emotions are valid, but my experiences, my whole self; a sense that I am loved, not « loved despite », but just loved; a sense that people understand me when I speak, that there are people who see the good in me and the value of my contribution 


Continuous & connected: a sense of who I am persisting despite big changes in the landscape of my life, despite grief, crisis and loss of loved ones. A sense that I am connected to this sense of persisting self and to others around me.


I’d say I’m working towards all of those pretty consistently, but that none of them are where they need to be. 

Without any specific external stimulus, sometimes I get this rattling emptiness. It feels like a disconnect, it feels like hopelessness and loneliness. It feels like emptiness, but it’s certainly not the absence of emotion, is it? 

I was wondering what you guys feel about the big empties—is it something missing, or something present? And what helps you when you feel that way?

Thanks!"
how to handle partner splitting,0,mln5hi,4,what's a good way to handle your bpd partner splitting on you? I love my gf dearly but when she's angry she can be so hurtful and it's hard to not react to her and then have her blame me for getting mad in return. she can love me one day and the next act like im the worst person ever and idk how to handle the value/devalue swings
Is it true we won’t be able to have children?,1,mln54r,2,"I’ve heard that if you get pregnant while single and have BPD, a social worker has a strong chance of taking your baby away. And you can’t adopt for sure. I totally get it because having a personality disorder and raising a child would be HELL and so unfair to the child, but I would want to raise it to be happy and not at all like my parents raised me. I always planned on adopting. 

Ive been in therapy for it and have made tremendous progress, but I’m far from perfect and won’t be for a longgg time. Even if I’m totally recovered in like eight years, would they even let me adopt because I have a past of BPD and possible self destructive behavior?"
DAE feel massively unsupported by mental health services,13,mln4et,2,"People in BPD are way more likely to attempt suicide, and way more likely to suceed, yet taken far less seriously than other mental health disorders because our ideation is more frequent and impulsive. And honestly I'm sick of it. 

I get it, attempts to hurt myself are a regular thing for me, feeling suicidal is a regular thing for me. But especially when it goes up in intensity I feel there is 0 support. I've flat out told services what I plan to do, with no prevention or intervention before I do it. I've been given mental health numbers more than I can count, been given the speech, been told ""we understand you're asking for help"" on my attempts, to the point where they don't even bother sectioning me or taking me to hospital any more they just tell emergency services to leave me at home. 

I feel let down, I feel I'm left alone to struggle. I'm tired of being asked what I want them to do to help, and then being told they can't do that because we must think longer term. It only takes one attempt for me to succeed in seriously hurting myself. In the moments I really need help, and don't get it, it makes me want to hurt myself out of pure spite to these services. 

Just today I was told that because I dont wake up early enough, I am not engaging and will be discharged if I don't fix my sleep. Despite attending 12 weeks of therapy and not missing one session, despite not missing one appointment with my care navigator, despite calling all of the helplines they give me before I take action, I'm not engaging. To them, non engagement must be the only reason I am not feeling better.

I'm sorry I'm just so sick of it honestly. I just want help and I want to stop being given the same bullshit when it comes to me being in a desperate situation."

Living in an apartment with ex-fiance of 5 years and their significant other with months left on lease,0,mlmvdy,0,"The title is the TL;DR of my situation, and I'm trying to figure out how to cope as I feel I've been spiraling worse lately and I'm afraid I'll say or do things I can't come back from. It's pretty long as I'm giving quite a bit of background so I appreciate if you make it all the way through.

I was with a partner for 5 years, and have known them for 9. They were my best friend. We've lived together for nearly 3.5 years. We planned on getting married; we were engaged and had an idea of the future together. Our relationship had it's issues and we both could have been better to eachother, me more so given my disorder, but also because we started dating as kids and are in our early 20s now; people change and grow.

My ex was poly and had feelings for other people during the span of our relationship, but never acted on them. That was a lot to deal with, and compartmentalize. About 8 months ago, I learned they had feelings for a coworker of theirs we had been hanging out with. And I thought maybe I could too, so I agreed to open our relationship and to mutually date this coworker. 

I spiraled a lot in that relationship, and got really bad for both myself and my partner(s). The coworker agreed to the relationship but very obviously only had feelings and inclinations towards my ex long term partner, and I was being gaslit (since apologized to) as to the imbalances I was noticing, and that I was asking for too much. My ex-long term partner tried to hold it together but we were already rocky as it was. When I mentioned going back to monogamy, that I couldn't handle polyamary, that I wanted things to be like how they were, ex-partner said that it wouldn't be fair to coworker, and they wouldn't just cut him off like that. That ""things change"" and when pressed, I learned they didn't want to get married to me anymore either because it wouldn't be fair; basically pulled the rug out from under me on the future we had had planned together in the 3 years prior.

I mourned that relationship, and what it used to be. I was chatting, venting and generally hanging out with a coworker (current partner) of my own for a few months leading up that I thought was becoming me new FP...turns out I was starting to crush on him especially in the latter half of the thruple relationship, at my lowest. So I asked both partners if I could pursue it, so that we could all have a slice of happiness and I wasn't such a mess at home. Two weeks into relationship with current partner, I broke up with thruple coworker but stayed with ex-long term partner.

Ex-long term forbade current partner from coming over, and partaking in hobbies that ex-long term and I would do together like cosplay or certain games. I tried to respect it because I know what I felt to feel jealous and protective of things like that. But I felt this was unfair as I was living with ex-long term and their boyfriend, who I felt did me dirty, and yet I was still being cordial. They told me it wasn't unfair because they couldn't help that he lived here; but the idea that I have to be around their boyfriend, and an ex of mine, while being unable to invite my own boyfriend over felt really unfair.

It was rocky obviously. And then I learned I wasn't actually poly and couldn't handle two relationships, especially with one that wasn't a thruple. I wanted to be fair to current partner as I felt I was being unfaithful somehow still dating ex-long term, despite current partner's complete acceptance, reassurance and understanding of the poly situation and things I've vented about previously. I wanted to have a future with current partner and I didn't want the mess that I was still clinging to from my previous relationship to scare him off, or make him feel like he didn't have my focus or love. I was confused and upset and anxious as fuck at my options, but I just felt so much better with current partner.

So I broke it off with ex-long term after they had been expressing grievances about my lack of reciprocation / not being able to be the partner I once was, but I couldn't parse my own feelings. I still love them, but I didn't know if I was in love, and I didn't want to ruin a good thing with current partner. Ex-long term partner told me that no one would be able to handle my disorder like they could, but have since apologized for such a toxic comment. Ex-long term begged me, told me they wouldn't want to be friends with me if we broke up when that's all I really wanted, and I sat on it for awhile, and after consulting current partner if I could try again, and getting the reassurance and okay for it, we tried again.
But I was still bitter about the relationship I had mourned, and how I was treated (and treated them) in the thruple relationship, and I still couldn't be the partner they wanted. I loved them but wasn't in love. Every time we were together, it was a new argument. We always argued, but it was more now. And finally, they broke it off with me, after writing a long list of things about me that irritated them, that they've since apologized for. And said that we should not be bitter like we were last time, when I wasn't bitter in the first place, just confused with so many life changes in so little time, and tried to have it be amicable. That we could still be friends and they just needed time to parse how they felt and grieve what they were afraid of.

It felt unfair somehow...even though it wasn't, rationally. There is no fair or unfair in things like this. That now that it was on ex-long term partner's terms, I wasn't allowed to be bitter or upset.
They promised they wouldn't ghost me as they have issues with doing that to others, and we own pets together, so they would send me some pictures of the pets a couple days after this. It seemed like it was sort of a segway to normalcy.

I'm good friends with all of my exes, and I thought that's where this was going. It's easy for me to bounce back to 'normal'...if anything, still being friends and not pretending like there wasn't history makes it so much better than just not, for me at least. It keeps negativity and bitter feelings from arising. I know everyone isn't like that. 
 
Communication eventually died down to nothing. They start ignoring messages, even messages about pets. I noticed I was softblocked on a website we used together when I wasn't a few days before. I got obviously upset, and I sent some long messages when I spiraled one night, nothing bitter or sinister but long, frustrated and confused, about the distance and the living situation and how I was being treated like a ghost now in the household, how I felt it was being put on me to find out when it's appropriate to be friends again.
Not only mourning 5 years of a relationship but 9 years of a friendship on my side. 

Was responded to being told this was one of the reasons they broke up with me; my long winded messages at early hours of the morning (despite a majority of our arguments being initiated from them; have no had any arguments with current partner like I did with ex-long term.) And how they need no contact to cope, but they didn't initially express that to me. And us living together makes that especially difficult, having to see eachother.

I come out of my room to hear them venting to their boyfriend in the living room, a space we can all come into, and I catch them say, ""I don't owe them anything, I'm tired of it!"" in regards to my message
I am not proud of my reaction that day. They told me not to interject in their conversation, but it was a conversation in a living space and felt I had every right to speak my mind. I'm a firm believer that there's a minimum you owe someone, especially with history.

I blew up, and they blew up back to me and we yelled at eachother back and forth. I made threats telling them I would make their life a living hell if this was going to be how they were going to treat me in the apartment after all of our history; like someone they didn't know, cold and uncaring. I'm not proud of it and apologized after 11 days of getting my mind together, and was ignored.

They say to respect what they need to cope, but tell me they don't owe me anything. And I can't handle no contact...a lack of normalcy makes me vindictive and bitter.
I have to respect what they need while ignoring my own needs, and my mention of that had them telling me to stop making myself the victim.

They need no contact to cope but that's impossible living together. We have two other roommates as well who I am moving in with when our lease is up, but I feel bad they've had to witness the mess that's been happening in the past half year. They've been there for both of us seperately, but one roommate has known me for 12 years so he's more inclined to sticking around with me. 

I told ex-partner calmly for the second time to start getting their clothes and such out of my room today. If we were on better terms, I wouldn't mind them leaving their things here because they really don't have a lot of space in their room with their boyfriend. But I can't cope having all of their stuff cluttering my living space, especially when I'm trying to be around more often.
They agreed to it but said I was being vindictive, but I reminded them that they said they didn't owe me anything, and I didn't owe them my living space.
It turned into another conversation about letting things settle, and no contact, and it got heated. They have a way of pushing blame onto me, and saying I need to take accountability but I feel they never take accountability, or realize when they're making themselves the victim as well. 
They told me they don't understand how I don't understand that they don't want to talk to me, and that this is why they dread talking to me. A total turn around to the bullshit they told me when they broke up with me, like cusion.
I just feel like they're taking a coward's way out for it all but I'm trying to be respectful...it's just really hard.

How do I deal with this ? I've been staying at my current partner's place a lot, and honestly I'm much happier in this relationship than I've been in awhile...I could gush and gush about all of the good things. He gets me, our love languages match, we can have conversations instead of arguments, we just...match. Ex-coworker partner told me I was too fat for him, despite having worked on my weight and having an eating disorder (which was jump started again after that comment). When I confided in my now current partner about that months before we were dating, his response was to tell me I was perfect the way I was, how shitty a comment like that was from someone who's supposdd to support and love you, but most of all, that if I wanted to get in shape, he'd work out with me. That was the positivity and support I needed in my life and he's been just as supportive now as he was then. He's like a sunflower and I just want to be around his warmth all the time.
But I don't want to rely on him as much as I did with ex-long term partner; I don't want him to feel smothered with my problems. And I especially don't want to get hurt...or to split and hurt him. I've been trying to look into therapy. It's been 3 months and my love keeps growing stronger, but I can't just live at his place and I'm afraid he'll see how bad of a person I am over time. I don't want to ever feel like I wasn't enough like I did in past relationship, enough for ex-long term partner to obviously want to date other people. I have to be back at my apartment sometimes. But every time I'm here and I see ex-long term and their boyfriend, I just get so angry. Especially with the no contact."
Dissociating during intimacy/sex?,9,mlmrgq,11,"The funny thing is I'm hypersexual. I frequently think about sex, just to not be fully present when it's actually happening. Every time things start heading there, or even when it becomes a possibility, my mind goes away and I shut down—even if I’m the one who initiated it. Thankfully this has never affected my performance though, because hey... my BPD brain needs that validation, right? LMAO.

I don't have any recollection of being sexually abused or assaulted, so... I seriously don't know what may be causing this, to be honest."
Every time I get into an argument with my partner I want to break up,1,mlmgs3,1,"I feel like I’m constantly cycling between optimism and wanting to fix things, and wanting to just end the relationship. In my heart I want us to fix things and just be happy together, but there are very real issues between us that can never seem to leave my mind. At some point, it came to be that every big argument we have leads to me asking if they just want to leave me, and going through all the reasons why we shouldn’t be together. I really think that I’m not good for them, I’m the first girlfriend they’ve ever had (we’re in our early-mid 20s), and I feel like that hinders their ability to see how things are. Sex, money and mental illness are our main problems, and those are pretty big things, but despite that I just want us to be able to come back to the love and happiness we used to share. One minute all I can think about is how sweet and wonderful and patient they are, and the next moment I’m reminded of our issues and feel like the whole thing is doomed. I hate that this is going to be what they base their future relationships on if we break up, I hate that I’m responsible for shaping their idea of love. I feel so incredibly guilty, and they still want to work on things, and a big part of me wants to as well, but then the other side of me wants to prevent any further suffering on their part. I would love and greatly appreciate any advice!"
Overdoing it? Should I just leave it be?,4,mlmf1n,3,"Whenever anyone starts answering things half-assed I feel like it's my job to pick it up. Normally I do this by turning the convo to them and only them with a basic ""what are you doing rn"" question or in this situation just ""what's up with you"".

Then keeping the attention on them until either they change it or the conversation ends. 99.9999999% of the time it never goes back to me and it ends after a bit. (Sorry a bit off track their but I still feel it important)

My dad is just answering me ok. He wished me a good day, I answered with a sentence about my day then I get ok back. Talk about how I got a good hand mixer for a good price, ok. Then I brag about it a little breaking down just why it's so good, sounds good. 

Now I'm thinking of swinging to convo over to him. I don't want to because I'm always talking about him or others. It's never about me and when it is, it's forced and I get nothing. 

My sister can buy a 25 cent pencil and my dad would be praising her for just how perfect and amazing it is. Nobody cares about what I do no matter how big and impressive."
I'm 99% sure my fucking stalker just called me *Trigger Warning*,0,mlmdo2,1,"Triggers for blood, suicide, stalking. Please no telling me ""change your number,"" ""go to the cops,"" ""just move,"" it is so much easier said than done.

Long story short, me and this girl were friends until I realized how toxic of a person she was and I cut her off. She used 3 different phone numbers to call me, she said she would show up at my house if I didn't talk to her, she would try to use my friend to contact me, she would do what I did when I was 18, but worse. She would constantly invite herself over, forcing herself into plans that I would have to face the consequences of when she told my parents she didn't have a way home.  She would just take my stuff and say ""oh well, you don't use it, do you? It looks the exact same as last time."" She would guilt trip me into giving her things, she would make me feel like shit in order to make it so I wouldn't stray from her. She would tell me that no one liked me except her, guys only talked to me for sex, money or for a joke. She didn't even like my ex because she didn't introduce him to me and was constantly telling me that her friend would be a better match, knowing that I wouldn't end the relationship if I got into it because I was too scared to lose her friendship. She would talk so much shit about him, but then act like his friend to his face. She would constantly tell me that he was cheating on me. One night, after me and him broke up after the second time we dated, I said he was a bit of an asshole sometimes. My best friend since the fourth grade and mother both said if he made me happy, then they're happy. But what does this bitch say? ""I told you so."" This stupid piece of fucking shit texted me one day saying ""hey, come over, I'm having a panic attack."" I had my dad drive me over, go into her room. She had cut herself and had me clean up the blood. She had notes for everyone and insisted I read her note as I was cleaning her blood. She told everyone that her ex boyfriend broke up with her because he had another girl. Nope. She broke up with him to fuck his best friend who had feelings for her. We met in the 6th grade and she got mad because I found a pen that she decided she liked. I went to the bathroom and she flirted with a guy in the class to take it. I asked for it back and she gaslighted me, ""it was my pen, I lost it last week or maybe you stole it."" We had an assignment in social studies the next day and we fucking bombed it because she was a petty piece of shit who refused to say any of the lines for a skit we had to do on the Black Plague. In the 7th grade, she went to a different school. 8th grade, she came back and sat with me and another friend, throwing small bits of food at me to try and piss me off. 9th grade, she acted as if none of that happened and we were the best of friends. It took me until the second year of college to realize how toxic of a person she was.

I have so many fucking stories about this piece of shit she was such a manipulative cunt and I ended up being her lapdog.

My dad saw her a few months ago at her job because he needed something. He told me what happened, he said ""hi Stalker"" and she goes ""how do you know my name?!"" He thought wtf you were my daughter's friend, but said ""you have a name tag."" She responds with ""oh yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting"" and I guess told him a story about how she had a ""mini stroke"" and doesn't remember anyone or anything.... except she has these prom photos with this one girl who she feels such a strong and special connection with.

But if you don't remember anything.... how do you know those were prom photos? I know I burned all the ones I had because you forced your way into the fucking photos because ""WE WERE LIKE SISTERS!"" and I couldn't even have one photo by myself, I couldn't even get one with the guy I liked who I ended up dating for a few months, without her guilt tripping me. My mom didn't pay for any of the fancy borders, nothing that said PROM 2015 or CLASS OF 2015, not even a prop sign in the back that said 2015, I wore a short mint dress, and it was at the aquarium.

So, how do you remember it was prom?

If you had a stroke that made you not able to remember anything from your past? How do you remember it was Prom.......?

She continued to tell my dad that her mom wanted her to take the photos down, but she wants to know who this girl was. My dad came home and told me what happened and that I probably shouldn't go in that store again.

Now, I know it's stupid to pick up phone numbers you don't know, but my work has like 4 different phone numbers and I don't save my coworkers' phone numbers so I don't accidentally call them, so I have a habit of picking up just subconsciously when I hear my ringtone. When I pick up the phone, sometimes it's a spam call, other times it's a legit call and other times, it's just silence. So what I've been doing sometimes is to say her name and tell her to leave me alone. Most of the time, my phone hasn't been by my face as I would hang up, but today I said it into the phone.

I said ""Stalker, leave me al-"" and then it hung up.

It was her. I'm telling y'all, it was fucking her. It's always been her. Every call that has been silent after me saying hello twice, it was her.

I still have the phone that has texts and screenshots of everything that happened. I should've gotten a restraining order when it was at its peak, but I stupidly didn't.

I just want her to leave me alone. I don't want to be her friend. I don't want her in my life. I don't want her to have control over me again."
I’m so sick of reading stigmatising things about BPD!!,11,mlm8fy,5,"I literally hate some of the things I read about BPD. I was looking for articles/info online to give my friends about BPD so they know how it affects me and my relationships and so many of them say things that I just don’t feel is correct. For example describing relationships with us as “tumultuous” and “emotionally draining”. I mean I realise that difficulty in relationships is such a huge part of BPD, but so many of us work so, so hard to be the best people we can, and we also have even more love and empathy to give than other people! I just feel like it’s so unfair that it’s so easy to access articles online that say things like “manipulative” and “destructive” when most of us are just doing our best to navigate normal life with these intense emotions and feelings about people. Yes, BPD can be awful and cause us to act in ways we aren’t proud of, but we do our best to not let it control us and we have so much love to give. 

TL;DR- I’m a fucking good person and a great friend and I’m sick of reading about how difficult it is to know us."

Ex asking to hookup update!!,12,mllnhw,4,"Guess what! 

Ex messaged me again asking to hookup after I ignored him the first time. Instead of ignoring him again I decided to give a mature (I think) message. 

“You used, manipulated, and lied to me. I spent so long healing and finally have moved on from you and you need to do the same thing, clearly sexually. You have no idea how badly you hurt me Jozef. Your actions traumatized me. 

You need to reevaluate yourself if you think this is okay to do. Frankly it’s disrespectful thinking I’m a disposable sex object here at your beck and call.”

“You waited three months to ask to hookup” 

Did I do okay? 

And I know for a fact that he read that shit because as I went to paste it and once again he said “never mind” after asking. Not even a minute later did I send my message. That’s how I know there is no way he didn’t see it. It shut him up and I don’t think he’ll ever message me again. 

For three months he has thought about me solely sexually, enough for him to ask twice. And I know he’s been pleasuring himself to the thought of me. The sad thing is that he probably didn’t delete my nudes when I asked. Makes me sick."

Anyone else got a parent that's nice does the bare minimum?,7,mlkzob,1,"My mother raised me for the most part, but she doesn't really feel like my ""mom"" if you know what I mean.

She pays the bills. Every two weeks I get a $100 for food (includes my cat). The rest of the time I don't see her or ask help with anything, and that's how it has been for three years. I know that I should be, and I *am,* very grateful that I have a roof over my head and food in the fridge.

I feel stupid for wanting more. I wish I could switch places with my cousin and soccer mom auntie. She cooks her daughter dinner and knows her friends, they even talk about the boys my cousin likes. They have a relationship. My mother hates hugs and has never said I love you."
When your parents found out you had BPD how did they react ?,3,mlk4ep,5,I was watching a Documentary one time of a football player who had BPD and I was like I totally relate to everything they were saying on the doc. I suggested to my mom that I may have BPD and she told me in a very harsh tone that nothing was wrong with me. I was 14 fast forward 7 years and I get diagnosed with it. ( My mom to this day denies I have no mental health issues even after I been diagnosed)
17 yr old with bpd,1,mlk0v9,1,"
I am 17 years old and got my diagnosis. i’ve struggled so much since I was 7. A lot of things happened that made me realize so much at such a young age. Growing up I was always confused, still am. Confused on why I did what I did, why I felt the way I felt. Once I turned 15, things got so bad. Meaning I ruined so much for me. (was already ruining things for myself since I was 10). I won’t say exactly what happened but a lot did. After that, that’s when I got help and eh it helped a bit but the feeling never leaves. I was doing very good last year when I was 16. Very good. I felt happy. I didn’t feel guilt, anger, or had suicidal thoughts, at all. Something triggered it in October of last year. A lot did tbh. I got bad again I recently got out of my “manic episode” in march since then. It’s weird because I swear it feels as if I blacked out through it all, with just a very few memories ( not good ones) . I cry everyday after my manic episode ends for months. ( i’ve noticed this with my past episodes) i always end up feeling better after but then ruin it... it’s a cycle that has been consistent in my life for as long as i can remember. i just can’t believe I messed up so much for myself, why do i do that? I feel better now I guess. Just so sad that i didnt stop myself): I have friends and they are great. great. the opposite of me actually, i have some of the most stable friends ever. So as you can see I dont open up really, they wouldn’t get it.Which also leads me to feeling alone with how I feel. But what I want to know is will it ever get better? is it too late to mature? will this be me for the rest of my life? I’m almost an adult I shouldn’t be this impulsive and i hate it. I just want someone with bpd to tell me it has got better for them. i need to know i wont always self sabotage for the rest of my life.

but i’m also quite optimistic which makes no sense. I also know i could get my life together. It’s not that bad, i think the reason i feel so hopeless sometimes is because of how haunted i am by everything that happened to me and how confused i am. i just dont get why me. so much that is just wow . but I have money saved up, a car, and im graduating in june. ( impulsively quit my job in february, working on finding a new one ): ) but i just don’t want to keep having to go through the pain of it all if it will always result in me ruining stuff for myself it’s so painful among with the trauma I have. It sometimes feels that i can’t handle it for the rest of my life. i hate having memories and flashbacks of all the trauma i just want to be happy and not ruin it."
I need a virtual hug,8,mljwsl,3,"This is probably the worst day I've had this year. I don't know where to start. I just got off Spring Break and it usually takes me a while to get back into the swing of things. I thought that maybe I would've felt more relaxed after the break but Monday I completely slept almost all day. Today I woke up and tried to make an effort to be productive, but I got an email about one of my student loans and saw how much I owed and panicked. I talked to my mom about my loans and how I was freaking out over nothing and I guess she's right...but why don't I feel any better?

Not to mention that my FP always makes everything about himself. I thought that maybe just this once he would try to comfort me, but instead he talks about how anxious HE is. He does this whenever I'm upset. Every single time I'm upset, he gets upset, and then I have to take care of him. If I don't, things will only get worse (ie he'll have a huge panic attack or hurt himself). I'm so fucking sick of it. 

So I had a panic attack today. I walked out of the room away from him, because he always finds a way to freak out and turn my feelings against me. It's like I'm not allowed to feel fucking anything. Having panic attacks alone is terrible, and doubly so when you're afraid for someone else. 

I'm typing this as he has came back from having a cigarette and now he's on his stupid goddamn phone. I know if I call him out on it, he's going to talk about how it helps him with his anxiety and how he wants to talk to this person he ""hasn't talked to in a long time""--so that makes it okay. If I were to do that, he'd say I'm not being there for him. Fuck him.

I'm afraid for my life. I feel like I can't do this anymore. Why go to school if I'm not sure I'll even graduate? I'm racking up all this debt and for what? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, and I wish I had someone here to comfort me. I don't know what to do--ever.

What did you do to not be destitute?

EDIT: I’m not doing something that requires me to live to work. Fuck that. I couldn’t bring myself to. Like literally, my brain wouldn’t let me. Life was meant for more than eating, shitting, sleeping and working."
self hatred and feeling entirely unloved,3,mljlqs,4,"I'm sure a lot of you feel this way too. Before my diagnosis, I was always wondering why I had always hated myself. It had always felt like I was born with self hatred, and I don't think I've ever experienced self love. As for feeling unloved, do any of you feel *entirely* unloved? It obviously has to do with the self hatred, but I've always felt that way. My parents aren't the best, especially my mom, but my childhood wasn't dark (even though I don't remember most of it), and I was told loving and uplifting things for most of it. The main and one of the only things I remember from my childhood is how dark my thoughts were, though. I barely even spoke as a child because I felt like I didn't deserve to exist. I still feel like that now, as a 22-year old. I know that BPD can come with these thoughts, but has anyone experienced them so deeply and strongly almost every day since they were born? I've been loved before, I know that, but not by many people, and either way I never felt like I deserved it. I have a partner now, and she's very loving, but I don't even feel loved by her anymore because I'm probably the lowest I've ever been. Can anyone relate to any of this?"

FP or enemy,0,mlj3zi,1,Hi! I'm undiagnosed but show a lot of signs of having bpd and I've noticed that after break ups the only way I can get over someone (who I actually like and care about) is by making them into the enemy somehow. Does anyone else do this?
EMDR success!,1,mlj2s4,0,"I recently found a great therapist and began seeing her. I was looking for someone who is in network with my insurance, taking new clients, and certified in EMDR. It took her a few weeks to call me back, but she did, and I knew as soon as we talked that she was a good fit. I did talk to two or three others on the phone too, but she was the best fit. 

She started with maybe 10 or 12 weekly sessions to take my history of traumatic events and do a sort of family tree. Then we were ready to begin EMDR. 

In the first session, I dealt with the death of my father at an early age (one of my first memories). It was so profound, I cried and cried. At the end, I felt it was cleared. I left with a deep sense of gratitude for all the people who helped me along the way in the time shortly after my dad died. The second session was a bust. I think she recognized it too and ended about 10 minutes early which was fine with me. I've only had two sessions, but have been so impressed with the first one that I an so encouraged. 

My therapist uses the bilateral buzzers with lights. I hold one in each hand. 

I've been at this therapy thing for a while. I've had CBT mostly. I've had lots of negative experiences, significant enough that I know they hold me back from achieving my potential, from having a fulfilling life. My functionality has improved over the years, but I still carry around these scars, emotional vulnerability and low self-esteem. 

For the first time in my life, I feel I have a chance to overcome. 

I wanted to share because I would not have known about EMDR if a friend had not told me about it. I have read a tiny bit about it on the internet and asked some mental health professionals before trying it. They all told me it helps significantly with trauma. I understand that BPD may have roots in childhood trauma, so I wanted to share here where I sometimes lurk in the hopes that it may help someone here. It gives me hope anyway.

Cheers to all of you!"
DAE do not know if your feelings are true?,2,mliw11,0,"I have been in relationships since I'm 15. Looking back i think I was not single for more than 2 weeks.
I had a 1,5 years, 10 years, 3 years and now 2 months relationship.

Usually I only get the courage to end a relationship when I feel I can trust the ""next"" one. I know, it's terrible and i feel guilt about that.

No boyfriend ever wanted to break up with me. They always tried to win me back. I thought it was because I am perhaps a good person to be with but i realize now it's just trauma bonding 

I now started a new relationship and I think I give my soul to my partner. I pay attention to everything they say. I try their hobbies. I get close to their family (i have no family so i always want to be close to my partner family). I offer 100% of support. I get close to their friends as well and disregard my own friends.

It was the birthday of my boyfriend and i went completely overboard. Bought 7 gifts,  baked a personalized cake .. and we are only two months together.

I know it is probably bpd but i love this men so much. How do I know if my feelings are true? I didn't say i loved him yet, but i do. I think about growing old together, about traveling and i can see all of this happening.

I'm just so worries there will be a day i will start painting him all black. Then i feel like I don't love anymore. I don't want to start the cycle again. I had amazing partners before and i left them because there were some things that didn't work. Instead of fixing these issues i moved to the next one...

Things that have “crushed” her and taken her “will to live”. I feel guilty. I feel her pain. And of course she felt pain that was 100x what a normal person would feel. I care about her and despite a heartfelt apology I still had these things thrown back in my face in the end. I never cheated on her or lied to her or degraded her as a person. In fact we had several conversations about her past sexual history and I never once made her feel bad about it. 

But, I don’t know where to begin to forgive myself. It’s really deep. I’m a good person. I don’t do things “to her” in a vacuum or maliciously and in at least one case she was a willing participant. The chaos and the emotions that came from the instability of her disease affected how I treated her in return. She was absolutely no angel and has no insight on her volatility bc she has no understanding of just how unhinged she was. No frame of reference.

That fight or flight reaction i got isn’t rational and when I was constantly under attack i was bound to make a mistake eventually. Mistakes of course were lorded over me forever and were brought back at all the worst times. I only ever remember the good times and she only remembers trauma. Seemingly, my ex never applied the same pressure to herself when evaluating how toxic she was towards me at her worst and what it did to me. Never held herself to account and applied the same unforgiving attitude. 


I smiled and sat there at our final lunch together and i listened to all of her grievances without a semblance of self reflection on her part. No acknowledgement for the hell I dealt with.  It was all about her and her feelings and what I did to her even when she was accusing me of being selfish. The ultimate irony. I served tables for a decade and kept my resolve and forced a smile on my face and told her she will always hold a special place in my heart even though I doubt she’ll ever feel the same way despite our 1.5 years together. 

It was hard but I feel like in the end I was the only one that was held to account for the chaos that WE were a victim to. Her disease stole a beautiful opportunity from us and I’m bitter and resentful about that more than anything. It’s just hard to forgive myself when i look back and it feels like I’m the only one that made mistakes."
Symptoms?,10,mlihc6,7,Does anybody else's BPD symptoms heighten during the time of their period? I find my emotions constantly changing during these times and i'm always on edge. I was just wondering if this happens to anyone else or if its just my meds not working anymore lol

BPD only occurs with romantic relationships,9,mlhx4n,5,"Does anyone else have completely normal friendships and relationships with people but when you find someone to date , you start splitting and overreact to things? When I’m not in a relationship I’m sad but usually ok. The relationships I have with people are normal and even kill. But when I’m in a relationship I go through so much rollercoasters! Does anyone else feel this way?"
My therapist of 2 years is leaving me...,2,mlh1bj,1,"Why do I feel so abandoned? She didn't even give an explanation why, though I suspect its because she doesn't think she can help me get any better. I feel so let down...I know I was just a patient, but she was the therapist I've been with the longest, out of the 12 I've seen in the past. It hurts so badly... I'm in bed crying now. And the worst part is I have to go about my day and pretend I'm fine, because none of my friends can ever handle my sadness, and they tend to just get annoyed when I feel bad."
Poor ability to recall memories after arguments?,29,mlgp97,8,"Whenever my boyfriend and I have an argument, I find that over the course of the few hours we fight, I begin to forget the beginning of the argument. The next day, it's like it never happened. Does this happen to anyone else?

For me, I know that it hurts him that I can't remember. One thing I do remember is that every time, he specifically says ""and the worst part is that you won't remember any of this tomorrow."" I don't consciously choose to forget! My brain just doesn't let me for whatever reason. Maybe I dissociate without realizing it, I don't know. I also have a hard time recalling memories from my childhood so maybe it's related? Anyone else also have problems with memories from their childhood???"
Communication with partner about BD?,2,mlgmyn,0,"Hi yall! 

I’ve been with my SO for 2.5 years, and I was diagnosed with BPD a year and a half ago. The first year of our relationship, I recognise that I treated him poorly, and I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to building a healthier bond. Now I’m in DBT, and ive spent a lot of time working on our relationship- establishing boundaries for both of us, cutting back on my codependent actions, learning how to self validate (it hurts so much to be honest, I just want to call him and be with him 24/7 but anything to have a healthy relationship with the person who loves and supports me!) 

I love him very much. I understand I may be hyper-vigilant, but I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this- I’d like to send him some resources on how to support and talk to people with BPD. However, I’m afraid it will come off as “haha I’m using bpd as an excuse, here is a guide on how to deal with me like an animal”. There’s the part of me that’s afraid that he will see it as me trying to make an excuse for my behaviour. Honestly, it’s for his own good- I want him to have the resources to correctly communicate with me for the sake of the relationship, and the more he understands bpd, the more he’ll understand me. As we all know, BPD can’t just be easily turned off, or it wouldn’t be a disorder. I want him to have the resources to keep both of us happy and healthy. 

Maybe I’m over thinking it? I assume he would be receptive, but maybe before I have this discussion I’d want to know if any of you have had this talk before, and the best way to start it! Also if there are any suggestions for materials to send to SOs or loved ones, I’d appreciate it! 

Thank you!"
Any married people on here randomly want to get a divorce?,0,mlg5ff,1,"I can't help but wonder if my husband and kids would be better off without me. My mental illness is so draining on me I can't imagine what it's like for them. Idk where else to go.

I just randomly get urges to divorce my husband and leave so he could go be happy with someone normal. 

Anyone else?"
"If you want to know what it’s like to have BPD, let me tell you...",489,mlfkrq,82,"EDIT: Thank you for the awards! I’m so glad me sharing my experiences and feelings resonated with so many of you. Thank you for all of the kind comments! You’re all lovely and valid❤️

This example is literally just from today and I think it sums up my experience with BPD pretty accurately. 

Today, my FP (also my S/O) went to work. He texted me after and told me he made a work friend that he found out he knew from a high school club (they competed against each other apparently). He shared this info with me to bring up one of those “small worlds” moments, but I couldn’t help but wonder if it was a girl, if they flirted with him, etc. I thought, what if he starts to like this person, thinks they’re better than me and leaves me?
I rationalized these thoughts quickly but I’m not proud that I even had them in the first place. 

Then he told me he was gonna start his drive home. Sometimes he’ll call me on his drive and tell me about his day. He didn’t today, so I asked if he wanted to, and if he didn’t feel like it, it’s okay. (I always make sure to do this, I do not want him to feel obligated to talk to me). He didn’t answer because he was DRIVING. Rationally I know that’s why. But my brain is mean, and a bad thought I had was that he was sick of me, probably saw my text before he started his drive, and ignored it because he thought I was being clingy and annoying. I thought, maybe he’s thinking about that person he knew from work and doesn’t want to talk to me and ruin it. He clearly hates me because he didn’t respond.

I RATIONALLY know none of this is true, but the thing with BPD is, you can objectively know one thing, but feel the emotions of another, and not be able to stop it. It’s like you see yourself about to crash but there’s nothing you can really do to stop it from happening. 

Then, he gets home, sends me a snapchat of his cat, and he hasn’t responded to my text. Rationally, I know he probably walked in, saw his cat, started to pet her, and thought, oh, my girlfriend would like to see this, sent me a video, thats it. 

But my mind was convincing myself that he is ignoring me because he thinks i’m annoying and is trying to prove to me that he doesn’t care about my texts by letting me know he’s active on other social media. I figured he was afraid to say no to calling me on his drive because he knows i’m sensitive and I’ll be very sad if he rejected me in any way, so he doesn’t want to deal with me being emotional and burdening him. I started to feel like a massive nuisance. So I texted him and told him he can say no to me when I ask to call if he wants to. 

Poor guy just calmly explained to me that he didn’t see my texts because he was driving, then came home, saw the cat, pet her. It was that simple. It was that simple for him, and for me I went on a whirlwind of intense emotions where I thought he hated me, was going to leave me for somebody else, that he was purposely ignoring me, that I was an emotional burden and he’d be better off without me. 

And it’s only noon. lol"
Can’t stop ruminating,8,mlfjys,2,"I can’t stop thinking about her. It’s just constant intrusive thoughts about her, obsessively going over in my head what happened, what was said, how it was said, memories and things that aren’t even really significant. I can’t stop thinking. Almost all my thoughts go to her and I’ve been doing more drugs recently just to quiet my mind. It was working for a bit but now it’s not enough. I feel pathetic cause I can’t help it. All I want is to not think about her but my head just won’t turn off. Sometimes I’m not even seeing things as they are and I’m so mad that my reality seems warped. It’s fucked up cause I’m the one who ended things yet I’m still hung up and still in a lot of pain. I can convince myself of what’s true, why I did what I did, convince myself things will be okay again and I can move on only to wake up the next morning feeling the complete opposite. Hopeless, angry and bitter. 

I don’t have a best friend anymore cause I had to cut things off, it wasn’t easy for me to see my ex/fp move on. I don’t have any friends cause the only other one I had lives far away and never attempts to message first. They’re going through their own stuff I guess but this has left me feeling rejected by everyone. While I crave connection I don’t want it at the same time because connection is hell for me. It always turns into something unhealthy and these days I seem more mentally ill than ever. So I’m in a constant cycle of wanting to meet people, needing to, trying and then ultimately giving up because a fear of rejection and knowing what it will turn into. I can’t even stay sober long enough to remember to reply to people. I’m just really alone and I feel worthless and unloveable. I can’t connect with others and no one wants to connect with me. I feel like a terrible person. I feel crazy. I feel stupid. And posting this is going to make me feel even more stupid"
I always have to have less [intake] than whoever I’m eating with because of my eating disorder,2,mlexj4,0,"Sorry for eating disorder post, this community is more active than the ED one I posted in, & I know BPD crosses over with eating disorders a lot! 


For some reason, no matter what stage of “recovery” I’m in from my eating disorder - which was previously anorexia, now not underweight or engaging in as many behaviours, so probably OSFED - I (24nb) cannot seem to kick a few behaviours that are interfering with my day to day life. 

The most annoying one is that I simply *have* to have less calories than whoever is eating with me, & will not eat anything that isn’t “safe” unless there are other people there so I can can eat less than them, therefore deeming whatever I do eat as “safe” (less = safe). For example, if I make hot drinks I usually take mine with 1 sugar & a dash milk, my partner has 3-4 sugars & dash of milk. However, if someone else is around that also takes 1 sugar & milk, I make theirs with a heaped teaspoon of sugar, & mine with my regular, pedantically level teaspoon of sugar. *Sometimes* in the past, when had a housemate I didn’t like, I would put more milk & sugar in her tea/coffee with the spiteful thought *”she’s going to get fat”* or whatever.. yeah, I know. Crazy. 

It extends into everything I consume, which is very difficult because I am mainly in control of cooking meals in my household (just me & my boyfriend, sometimes my other boyfriend is round for dinner). If I wasn’t cooking for my partner, I would exclusively eat “safe”, disordered meals.. which sadly I do when he’s at work, or starve until he gets home. 

It’s this weird cycle of absolutely loving to cook & eat, but the disordered thoughts are always replacing my milk with soy, coconut milk & cheese with LIGHT products, serving myself up 1 spoon of rice & covering it in sauce to be sneaky, or freaking out that things are spoiled; I feel like a teenager hiding these silly behaviours. 

Some other, less concerning but equally annoying behaviours/intrusive thoughts I cannot seem to shake are: I cannot eat anything that has been out on the bench that has left my sight, due to an unimaginable fear that flies have laid eggs on it. I cannot consume food after I have seen maggots or flies because I convince myself they (maggots or fly eggs) are in my mouth. Or rather, I try to convince myself they’re not, that’s how strong the feeling is. This seems less eating disorder related & more like an intrusive thought, *but* I’m wondering if anyone else with an ED has these weird thoughts? Is it cuz I’m autistic & it’s food aversion? I don’t know. I have a lot of textural issues with food. 


I’m extremely reluctant to mention my eating disorder (of 10+ years) to my psychiatrist, as the only time I’ve mentioned it to a medical professional or even indicated it was when I was 15, when I was diagnosed but not treated because I did not tell my mother, & in the psych ward 3 months ago, where it was completely ignored, which made me spiral further into thinking my disorder isn’t valid because of my weight. 

Any insights or validation or resonance with these behaviours would be appreciated."
DAE get upset remembering honeymoon phases of relationships?,19,mlewa8,8,"I started thinking about how my FP (also my significant other) used to call me almost every day and invite me over most nights. He would make an effort to cuddle with me frequently and he would video chat with me if we weren't able to see each other for a few days. He seemed generally happy and we had sex frequently.

It's been almost 3 years now and he keeps about half his clothes at my place, has a key, and keeps all his toiletries there so he basically lives with me part time, almost full time. He doesn't call me anymore, I always call him. He doesn't video chat me if we're apart for a few days. He basically puts in effort to give me attention every once in awhile, but it's not consistent like it used to be and our sex life has dwindled to almost nothing.

I understand that logically, people get comfortable together and stop putting in as much effort as they had to in the beginning of their relationships (whether it be friendships or romantic). I was mildly annoyed about our dwindling sex life, but I understand that fades naturally as well, even if I wish it didn't. I started reminiscing this morning about how things used to be and it sent me into a total panic. 

Has anyone else managed to upset themselves just by thinking about how things used to be?"
I'm hated. And I'm probably actually gonna die alone.,2,mlel5i,0,"My brother molested me when I was 10.. 5 years later, I had no where to go when my mom...kicked me out over and over, i went there cause they were the only people who promised a break from my mom's constant downing I was 15...  My brother raped me for three months did I fight, no, was I on heavy amounts of Xanax .. yes.I slept through an entire police raid, if stay here, i will literally think about it for the next year, lile.why didn't I try to stop him.. idk..i always freeze or try to make My brain stop, that's a thing in my brain I ain't found yet, it's all really fuzzy  and the factor in most my guilt because I don't know.  But that was your way of telling me how badly u needed me gone... I know...I can't stop thinking about that now.  shot, sent to war, and raped  again and outcasted and I learned from that point,  I'm probably going to die. U ever wanted something so bad, life changing and one phone call.. took it from me,, I wish I couldve gone back and not called Casey,  he called the police.. everything changed for me.. the only shot i was ever given was taken because I didn't keep.it.to myself..I was 20. My life sucked.. And I saw the future..i.knew.... it's crazy the irony of my life, I've been married twice wasn't in love with anyone until I met my SO, is that selfish to think the person I feel for, musta felt the same? My existence was horrible before you and it has slowly gone back.to that feelingbefore I met u... I think it was the darkness inside u that.i  related, I was always hopeful we could turn it from black to gray. It was lightening up for a while and I was slapped in the face when he came out as bisexual and especially into transwomen, u don't need a man who pays to be a girl, if u have one.. I can order a dick of any size.. I don't get it. Why I couldn't be you're life, u never understood you were everything and more.. my last dollar.. my last cigg..idk. that guy who made me feel confident has now shown Me how I could never compete with your hottie... I cant..After 7 years of being together, traveling the country together.. tearing down and building up. We're a horrible couple but that's what made us strong.. our unacknowledged pain, and how hard we denied it but always forgave each other when it surfaced because we knew.. . I started losing my denial when u came out, I didn't understand it and I wished u never did. Stonewalling me, gaslighting me... like u didnt understand it took everything to put that effort in and I did it because I wanted u to be happy even at the cost of me, I'd be okay.. . chump change when I compare to when I hear u really laugh, when u smile withoutforce ... Boys Girls aliens, I've never truly desired anyone but you, my entire Ora brain reiwired when I knew I couldn't make u happy, that changed my life.. U were beating the living literally living shit out of me and I felt like you were taking my life, my body, and it was at anytime u could end that for me.. so I found a way to feel somewhat in control of MY BODY. you never have to think about me again.. but it WAS always my body and that was my solice in dark times. It made me come back to me, and it kept me going when I LET people do what I ALLOWED THEM to DO MY body. You were wrong when you realized u couldn't forgive me and u stayed. U were wrong for never allowing me to feel, or me to ask necessary questions that weren't meant to shame u but to understand. I lose the battle because I don't understand it. I can't find a reason how anyone falls that deeply out of love with me and in love with something so logically ugly, guess we were always attracted to broken unacknowledged pain.. I can't figure out why no matter how hard I tried I couldn't change us. I don't know why you couldn't understand what I did was out of a really a lost place... as yours is too. For the last two years... I just wanted u Back the most.. I needed you.. and you were gone. Idk. I was really trying to be normal to make up for what I did. I was. I died at your hands more then once..... isn't that a rebirth? Don't I get another shot at life? No. I wished it worked that way. I'm sorry I don't understand why we couldn't find each other in the dark places. I'm sorry. I really mean it.. every time I say it. But you are now unacknowledging your own pain, and mine. I truly can't go home.. I can't stay here.. I feel like a retarded burden who can't grasp unlogical situations. Even through the chaos everything made sense.. it hasn't since u told me I could never be your fantasy.. when you shared your fantasy.. I died. It was always my goal to make u happy through my black areas.. because u always did. We stopped. But then I saw you get lighter without me. I saw enough to know, I need to go. Why should I be miserable, make u miserable when one of us has a shot.. that's where I am. U won't find me for a while, thats if I can stop being a coward.. a baby.. a loser for more then 10 minutes. 

Maybe it's not fair, but your were my support.. I was yours until this..  I'm sorry I can't be stronger, I'm sorry.  I can't imagine a future. It's not black, it's just abyss. And I can't do it alone, I can't. I'm sorry dude. I never could translate, i.hope you can understand in this last weird brain memo, I'm sorry I hurt you, i.was trying to ease my pain. I'm sorry. I'll miss you guys.. not really, all feeling stops and Im excited about that. I haven't had a break. I need one. I love you both."

Accepted into my masters (and much more),50,mldpls,3,"Sooooo this is a huge victory for me. I struggled *so much* with my sense of self and didn’t know who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 

I graduated high school in 2013 and left my home at 17 with only a backpack filled with everything I could fit in it. I established myself 650 miles from where I grew up, with no financial help from parents. 

I tried multiple programs but could literally *never* find something that truly fed me and who would lead me to an actual job. 

My life was chaos. I was homeless for a while (I was lucky enough to stay at a friends place so I was never out on the streets), I couldn’t afford basic necessities, I couldn’t pay my rent. I did sex work for a while. I was in unhealthy relationships. 

It was hard. But I’m quite persistent. 

In 2018 I met my partner. In 2019 I landed an amazing job that totally fuelled my passion for education and gave me purpose. In 2020 we moved into a great apartment. In 2021 we got engaged and I just got into my masters. In a year we’ll be married and he’ll have graduated from an engineering program.

Diagnosed but I don’t feel borderline,0,mldhyk,4,"I got diagnosed with BPD when I was 18 (I’m 21 now) and I’ve began to think it was done too rashly by a doctor I only saw a couple of times.

I often read posts here and I find it hard to relate. I don’t fear abandonment, in fact I get over things faster than the average person so abandonment would be no issue to me and in relationships it’s usually the other person who clings to me and I’ve been called uncaring even when I’m not. 

My emotions are rather fleeting, sometimes I feel like I never felt at all because everything is just whatever to me although I’m still an enthusiastic person (if you get it).

My self-esteem is good, I don’t care what people think about me but I do have unstable relationships because I have a tendency to act out and I get angry easily.

 I can’t handle boredom and basically I do stupid stuff all the time (hard drugs, pick fights, shoplift, etc) and i’m super impulsive, it’s really hard for me to resist temptation so I also cheat easily and I find it fun to play with people’s feelings (I suspect it’s because drama kills the feelings of boredom that I dread).

I don’t self harm although I used to when I was younger, don’t feel suicidal, don’t dissociate although I’ve had a psychotic episode or two. 

My opinions change fast and I might suddenly dislike someone for no reason and people have called me unstable, I feel like people take life too seriously and that’s why I just do whatever just because. 

But why was I diagnosed with BPD? Could it be a misdiagnosis? I find it really hard to relate to this sub especially with people who are clingy and say they feel too much

Edit: My life is in a constant state of chaos as I’m in trouble with the law often, can’t hold onto jobs and have a ton of debt so maybe that plays into it?"
Is this normal?,2,mldh8u,2,I always feel like I'm going to die soon and it's an intense feeling that comes over me. Has an almost crippling effect and makes me get consumed in my head. End up not moving for like 10 minute periods just thinking and being stuck in my head.
People say they care but they don’t,0,mldf7k,2,My friends say they worry about my mental health but don’t leave me alone and ask me what’s wrong when it’s convenient for them and when i say i don’t wanna talk about it or i just need some space for a while they won’t leave me alone until i tell them which makes me angry. they invite me out but when i go they straight up ignore me which makes me feel stupid and i regret ever leaving my house ever. i feel like crying when i’m surrounded by people who say they care but ignore me when they want to. i don’t understand this. why?
How do I cope with this?,1,mld0me,5,"He cut me out....AGAIN. My ex and I chose to be friends after some time apart. Things were ok at first, then I started to get upset because his words and actions never matched up. We'd get in arguments because of how he was treating me, and his lying, it caused me to have some mental breakdowns. I started to have major issues trusting what came out of his mouth and needed constant reassurance. The first two times he cut me out, I became suicidal as he's been a huge part of my life for years. Despite how he's treated me, I always miss him like crazy and want him in my life. I feel a sense of relief when he comes back. 
He took me out for my birthday brunch 5 days ago. He wrote me the most beautiful birthday card apologizing for how he's treated me...that I deserve better, how he's going to be a better friend to me, how I have such a good heart...Well then during brunch, I found out he lied again and lost it...started crying at the table and having a panic attack. We went back to my house and it continued. When he was about to leave, I became clingy and begged him to stay. I was scared he was going to leave me, cut me out again. He reassured me that was not going to happen, then he left. I even asked if he was just saying that so he could leave, and he said no. For reassurance, I gave him my spare house keys, to promise me he wouldn't cut me out.

Well I've tried to contact him a few times and no response. I've been completely ignored, and he's been active on social media. I haven't been suicidal yet, but I'm in so much pain and dealing with severe anxiety..the ruminating won't stop. I've completely lost my appetite and already lost a few lbs, I can't sleep and wake up with panic attacks at night. I've called the crisis hotline for support numerous times. This has broken me. I just want to hear from him, for everything to be okay. I don't know how to get through this...how do I stop this pain? This is severely and negatively affecting my life."
acceptance,7,mlcwbs,2,"I was thinking about this... all my past relationships.. family, some friends, and boyfriends have all used my mental health against me. I’ve told them and confided in them and trusted them. a lot I didn’t even tell I had BPD, I mostly just said I had anxiety and depression because of the stigma that BPD gets. but they even used those things against me and called me crazy and it’s just stuck with me. 

now I’m at the point where I’m 21 years old and I think I completely loathe myself. honestly, I’m at a point where my life is completely coming crashing down. and I’m not sure if this cycle will ever stop. I need to learn how to manage these emotions and not be so self destructive in the ways that I cope. 

all i think about myself are negative things. and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even know who I am anymore or what to believe about myself. I’m in a complete mental crisis and I just don’t know how to come out on the other end."
Well shit...,6,mlcqbr,1,"Hiya reddit. I’m a 28F and was recently diagnosed with BPD after a breakup led me to a fit of rage in which I punched a doorway and broke my hand. 

I can’t even begin to express my gratitude for finding this community. There are some struggles, like favorite person obsessions and extreme romantic fantasies, that made me feel so alienated and broken and weird. I also find it amazing how we all seem to write and compose our thoughts similarly. I bet we share a lot of the same gifts as well as challenges. 

I’m posting today because I’m at the stage in diagnosis where I’m feeling hopeless. I’m currently single, unemployed, slowly chipping away at my graduate degree and raising a beautiful 3yo daughter while I attempt to get my shit together. Now that I’m acknowledging my disorder, it feels like this insurmountable obstacle. I need some encouragement. Is anyone out there doing alright? Happily partnered? Made it through grad school? Kicking it unmedicated? Raising kiddos successfully? 

Please share your wins... I need to see them. I’m starting to feel like this BPD situation is going to keep taking everything from me and I’m terrified of treading in place until I die."
DAE find they can't explain themselves and their emotions to people?,31,mlcfzt,10,"It always seems like I can't explain myself, what I deal with and so on to many people. It's something that is consistent, and makes it hard to keep on going and explaining it to people. I just want to explain it so people understand more.

There's things like when you attempt to talk about what you go through and what not where it then gets lessened by the other person whether intentionally or not. Their responses like ""oh we all like that *sometimes*"", (I had another example on my mind but forgot), or they talk about how they are and what it's like in attempt to relate only for me to be sat there thinking ""you really don't understand what I said, or I explained it super poorly."" In the moment it can feel really invalidating, but as I have heard said before, people can only relate with their own experiences. 

When it comes to other people like on here or someone I know locally who has BPD, usually the blanks in explaination can be filled in and understood because well.. you are both dealing with the same beast. If that makes sense.

I just want people to understand, and to support me. Know that I spend almost all my time absorbed in something like a game or something else so that I don't think about things. Maybe, it would be nice if more people knew the chaos I was dealing with internally instead of just assuming.

Anyways, sorry for the long post. I just kind of want to know what others may experience on this. I love you all and I know there are some people here I have communicated with who have been wonderful."
I always have to have less [intake] than whoever I’m eating with because of my eating disorder,0,mlc4sx,0,"So I’ve cross-posted this in an eating disorder specific sub, but figure eating disorders cross over with BPD a lot & I thought I might post here too... 

For some reason, no matter what stage of “recovery” I’m in from my eating disorder - which was previously anorexia, now not underweight or engaging in as many behaviours, so probably OSFED - I (24nb) cannot seem to kick a few behaviours that are interfering with my day to day life. 

The most annoying one is that I simply *have* to have less calories than whoever is eating with me, & will not eat anything that isn’t “safe” unless there are other people there so I can can eat less than them, therefore deeming whatever I do eat as “safe” (less = safe). For example, if I make hot drinks I usually take mine with 1 sugar & a dash milk, my partner has 3-4 sugars & dash of milk. However, if someone else is around that also takes 1 sugar & milk, I make theirs with a heaped teaspoon of sugar, & mine with my regular, pedantically level teaspoon of sugar. *Sometimes* in the past, when had a housemate I didn’t like, I would put more milk & sugar in her tea/coffee with the spiteful thought *”she’s going to get fat”* or whatever.. yeah, I know. Crazy. 

It extends into everything I consume, which is very difficult because I am mainly in control of cooking meals in my household (just me & my boyfriend, sometimes my other boyfriend is round for dinner). If I wasn’t cooking for my partner, I would exclusively eat “safe”, disordered meals.. which sadly I do when he’s at work, or starve until he gets home. 

It’s this weird cycle of absolutely loving to cook & eat, but the disordered thoughts are always replacing my milk with soy, coconut milk & cheese with LIGHT products, serving myself up 1 spoon of rice & covering it in sauce to be sneaky, or freaking out that things are spoiled; I feel like a teenager hiding these silly behaviours. 

Some other, less concerning but equally annoying behaviours/intrusive thoughts I cannot seem to shake are: I cannot eat anything that has been out on the bench that has left my sight, due to an unimaginable fear that flies have laid eggs on it. I cannot consume food after I have seen maggots or flies because I convince myself they (maggots or fly eggs) are in my mouth. Or rather, I try to convince myself they’re not, that’s how strong the feeling is. This seems less eating disorder related & more like an intrusive thought, *but* I’m wondering if anyone else with an ED has these weird thoughts? Is it cuz I’m autistic & it’s food aversion? I don’t know. I have a lot of textural issues with food. 


I’m extremely reluctant to mention my eating disorder (of 10+ years) to my psychiatrist, as the only time I’ve mentioned it to a medical professional or even indicated it was when I was 15, when I was diagnosed but not treated because I did not tell my mother, & in the psych ward 3 months ago, where it was completely ignored, which made me spiral further into thinking my disorder isn’t valid because of my weight. 

Any insights or validation or resonance with these behaviours would be appreciated."
I've just found out,27,mlc3gu,19,"I'm completely in shock. 

I've been looking for a diagnosis my whole life and my psych just casually throws it at me while we were on an unscheduled call just now. 

I want to call someone I love to celebrate but I don't know who to tell. I don't know who will understand how much of a relief it is to finally fucking know what's wrong with me. 

We even have a plan in place to start treating it right away, I'm already on my way to the pharmacy for new meds. 

Losing my mind with conflicting emotions right now but I really just want someone to talk to about it.

It's a beautiful day to be diagnosed!"

All male BPD’s,24,mlbfxp,30,"I was just reading that BPD is most presented in women, which made me wonder about you guys.

Have you ever had a problem with getting help as it is an illness mostly common with women?

Do you experience it differently, for instance ADHD can be very different in women and men?

My brain couldn't have chosen a worse FP,7,mlb97p,4,"I met a boy online in a mental health venting community about a month ago, and it turned out we lived really close so we've met up twice since then as well as just messaging every single day. He's the most caring person I've ever met, as well as really cute, charismatic, funny, just perfect. I developed a crush as well as an intense FP attachment to him extremely fast.

The problem is he's severely depressed, has attempted suicide more times than I can count only since I've met him, and isn't ready to accept any kind of help. I've tried (and failed) to help him through suicidal nights a few times and I feel completely helpless because I've realized there's nothing I can do to help him. I have since told myself that I can't try to talk people out of suicide again because it puts a massive toll on me, but it's so hard to see him in pain.

We have good communication and have talked a lot about our friendship, and last night it came to a point where he told me he knows how much seeing him in pain hurts and worries me and he doesn't want to put that stress on me anymore. I'm so terrified that this means he's about to abandon me ""for my own good"" or something. I've tried communicating how deeply attached I am to him but I'm scared of explaining the FP thing because I don't want to scare him off. But he's convinced I'd be better off without him and I'm broken. He's 90% of what I think about and I don't know what I'd do if he left me and I had no indication of whether he's even still alive. This hurts so much."

I feel like i’m not allowed to speak to my friends + family,1,mlae27,0,"DAE realise how stupid and unnecessary it is to not want to speak to your friends + family but you feel like you have to keep shut. i feel like if i speak to them i’m giving them more privilege than i should (because they hate me, they’re plotting against me, why should i talk to them? it would be kicking myself in the foot)"
"Has anyone else done deplorable things merely for the approval of others? I am riddled with guilt because of my past, and I do not deserve to live.",1,ml9f50,4,"In my adolescence, when untreated and undiagnosed, I routinely did bad things for the appraisal of my friends and bullies.

Is it normal to cry because someone pointed out something about you?,19,ml8gc0,16,"I practically cried for hours straight and starved myself for weeks because right after I came back from ditching all my mates for a whole month, they made a comment about me being fat while I was already starving myself most days and losing weight rapidly but I still went back to them a while after that happened but I still starve myself. Is it bad or am I normal for a person with bpd?"
Questionable Behavior Regarding Someone Who is Borderline,1,ml7pgs,11,"I had a close friend who was bpd. She did a number of questionable things like in the beginning claimed she had this ex that was terrorizing her life, that he had access to her phone somehow and was watching her every move and listening to every phone call. She even told everyone at our workplace this was happening. I had asked further questions about this over time and... yeah I really didn't believe her. She would even tell every guy she hung out with that she was being spied on, and would then call me freaking out absolutely convinced that they were doing it too and downloaded some spy program her ex supposedly used since she told them about it. I kind of asked.. well if your so afraid of it happening again then why tell anyone at all? She didn't have much of an answer. She really had this paranoia of being spied on or that people wanted her so badly that they were going to these great lengths. Just overall she seemed like she was going through some major crisis that, as I got to know her seemed to be exaggerations or just plain bs. She called me daily to talk about herself and her life.. I was really going through a rough time when we were friends. Despite that I really made a solid effort to help and be a patient understanding friend and it just really felt super unreciprocated. she just seemed to think the world revolved around her. And when I was doing really poorly with my depression and drug use, dealing with my fathers sudden death. it seemed like she was angry and impatient I wasn't there to play armchair therapist for her. Seemed like she only wanted me to feel better so she could use me as an emotional dumping ground, and that the relationship wasn't really as meaningful for her as it was for me, I felt used. I was leaving for a work trip early in the morning once and hadn't packed yet. But since she had something important to do I agreed to watch her daughter free of charge to show i'm a good friend. When she gets back she hangs out for a few hours and then wouldn't even give me a ride home, I acted like it was cool and I got she was tired but I was shocked and disappointed. I really felt like the relationship was based on what I could do for her over time and one day I just cut her off."
Should I just quit my current job,4,ml7nct,3," 27. Been working since I'm 18. I get fired 50% of the time. Through the years I got diagnosed, there's a clear pattern of illness getting worse over time.

I'm having a rough moment in life. I've just been taking my med and forcing myself to sleep since last weekend (anti-depressant that makes you sleep, not recreational drugs). Lots of dreaming so it's not like I'm resting while sleeping. I've basically been bedridden since last friday and only recently I'm coming out of bed and my back hurts but that's another story.

I can't work like this, I haven't worked at all for the last two weeks. I just pretend I'm working. Job is definitely taking me to the edge, superiors have started making demands and scolding me because of my fault.

This has been my fault, I've stopped seeing my doctor for a while, now he doesn't want me as a patient. I've tried to force myself to be employed through this hell and I only keep a job for some weeks only to get fired. I actually wish I was in the psych ward right now. Last week I was going to start crying and my mother just told me to fuck off and cry somewhere else. I'm back to living with parents and I can't expect support from them, they're doctors, they shouldn't have to put up with this, I recognize that.

Right now I just wish I had nothing to worry about. I don't even care about financial ruin.

I don't even know how to quit, I have lots of pending very important reports."
paranoia over relationships,3,ml70vq,1,"and this guy online living like soooo many miles away is talking to me??? and for over a year now? i don’t know how that happens because i’ve never talked to someone for so long. undoubtedly, it is on and off, but in the end it’s still there. i don’t know why it happens. it’s so embarrassing. i hate it. i don’t trust them. i’m so paranoid over it. why is he doing this? what does he want from me? what the fuck. i hate him. what the hell is he thinking. oh my god. like just stay away from me. give up. are you seriously gonna play with me like that?? i’m not a toy. i don’t trust them. but that’s just my paranoia right? i can’t tell if this is intuition or paranoia. i can’t tell!! all rationality goes out the window when it comes to relationships w ppl i have romantic feelings towards?? 

everytime they give me attention i feel like a giddy schoolgirl fangirling over a celebrity!! and then i hate them afterwards. i just don’t trust them. i can’t trust anybody like that. i’ll never. i can’t let myself. i hate them but i want them 

it’s so embarrassing talking about them and coming up with all these scenarios in my head and trying to figure how to go about them. trying to avoid thinking about them. trying to avoid talking to them. trying to distance myself away from them. then it comes crashing down the second they message me and then again the cycle repeats itself afterwards. i don’t trust them. im saying all this and it just confirms that i’m obsessing when i don’t want to be. it’s embarrassing and humiliating. it makes me feel weak and powerless."
"Has anyone else ever been referred to as “cold,” “mean,” and/or “narcissistic?”",9,ml6riq,4,"Lately, I’m very nasty and mean. It’s like all the empathy I learned in therapy has dissipated, and I am back at square one. Ever since I stopped taking my lamictal, I’ve been exceptionally mean and unfeeling. It’s like there’s a hole in the spot where there’s supposed to be consideration and empathy. My bf thinks I’m very “cold,” “narcissistic” and “shallow” sometimes, and it’s bad because it’s like I lost the motivation to care. I have not been called narcissistic since high school, and I haven’t been this mean in a very long time. I cannot stand being this nasty to people, but again, there’s a lack of feeling to care, and idk why. Is it a self-hatred/ insecurity thing? Is it that my medication is drastically affecting my moods? why am i lacking motivation to care in the moment, and then when I hurt people, I feel remorse?"

I have this feeling constant and it never goes away. Sure I use meds and what not to clear my head but then boom I do dumb shit like drink for 3 days in a row. Like why do I do that when I tell myself every day ""don't be an idiot, don't be an idiot""?. I'm in school, always wanted to go to school, and now I'm in school and I'm like ""fuck this"".

DBT isn’t working and I don’t know what to do,1,ml690s,1,"Note: I’m sorry about my grammar I don’t know English well and when I was signed up for my English class I ended up in the hospital and had to drop it and my counselor isn’t helping me join the class so ya.

So I’ve tried DBT for a year and I’m going to be honest it’s just not working and my psychologist is constantly booked so I have no one to talk to about my problems when I absolutely need to. I recently had my biggest breakdown because of my bpd pretty sure I could’ve gotten myself killed if I did said action to the wrong person then again that person really chose to fudge me over when I was on my last straw. So leading up to this event which occurred Monday or Tuesday (last week) Sunday my boyfriends dad basically gave us an eviction notice and of course Monday I had my behind the wheel test I was stressed the whole time and the guy that was with me profiled my instructor he said “I haven’t seen his kind around here” which really got me going I ended up failing which didn’t make me upset but ya and I found out at the end of the day that my boyfriends dad just said what he said to get us riled up I’m not sure if it was this day or the day after when the straw just broke and I was at Starbucks with my mom and this black suv cut us off and oh my god that was just it I got out stood in front of her car and said “Back the fudge up” then she tried to argue with me saying she didn’t see us HOW DO YOU NOT SEE A YUKON XL THAT IS BIGGER THAN YOUR TAHOE YOU’RE EITHER USED TO FUDGING PEOPLE OVER OR YOU’RE RECKLESS AND DON’T WATCH WHERE YOU ARE DRIVING then she tried to scare me by driving up closer I told her I wasn’t letting her ruin my day even more then the passenger told her something and she backed out and drove off. I messaged my psychologist right after  then felt helpless because he said I should go to the DBT class again which he knows I don’t have time for (work) and when I called his office the next morning because I thought hey maybe they’ll let me have a one time appointment with a different psychologist that’s available they told me no and that they were going to transfer me to a suicide hotline which pissed me off all I did was ask for someone to speak to."
Things our parents should have taught us,5,ml60l5,1,"Being that almost all of us probably suffered abandonment abuse and neglect from our parents, what are things you never got to learn from your parents that might help others?

For me the biggest is they refused to teach me to drive or help in anyway. I'm 24 and finally about to get a license

My mother has refused repeatedly to give me tax information so I could get fafsa and go to college, but I'm finally old enough to do it without her.

Other things like my dad being gone hand never taught me to shave, tie a tie, talk to girls, etc.

My parents being separated I never learned about proper relationships and love.

 being abused and neglected I never learned to trust people and never learned the whole worlds not trying to hurt me and use me.

They let me drop out of highschool and didnt do anything after multiple suicide attempts as a teenager and my step father used to beat the shit out of me and kick me out for weeks at a time. I had no self value and self worth and no way so young to get help on my own.

I dont know. Theres so much that normal parents do that many of ours didnt and I really would like to know what lessons and things you guys learned later on that you should have learned in loving family.

First Episode after receiving diagnosis,4,ml4opn,1,"CW/ sh and substance use

Hi, I’m new here and just got diagnosed with BPD not very long ago. I’ve had a very difficult time coping with this diagnosis, as I have been misdiagnosed constantly by mental health professionals since freshman year of HS (I’m a college sophomore now). Friday night, I had one of the worst episodes of my life. Triggered by rejection by a guy I had been talking to, I immediatley spiraled. I have been s*lf h*rm*ng since sophomore year of highschool, and in January relapsed and have been struggling since. I went to my room alone and started s*lf h*rm*ng and called my mom and just screamed at her about how badly she fucked me up. My mom has never taken my mental health seriously and growing up, made me feel ashamed constantly. 

Normally when I’ve had episodes in the past (not knowing that’s what it was since I was undiagnosed at the time) I would word vomit out of anger/hopelessness. But Friday it was on another level. I had been drinking a lot (which I’m starting to realize I do when I’m having an episode) and cussed out my mother and told her about my drinking, smoking weed, being an atheist etc. (My parents are very conservative and my mothers dad was an alcoholic). The next day I was so ashamed when I woke up I couldn’t even function. Is it a common thing to say these types of things during an episode? Does anyone else feel so disgusted with themselves for outbursting like this?

I planned on ignoring my mother until she reached out to me, but last night I called her with the intention of explaining why BPD caused me to have this reaction, but she invalidated my diagnosis and called me an attention seeker. How do you deal with loved ones rejecting your BPD? I feel so alone, and then her saying that makes me doubt myself and that I am an attention seeker, even though I know that’s not the truth:( help"
Some feeling between jealousy and anxiety,1,ml4mpa,0,I am going to start taking therapy from some psychologist at the weekend and i decided to look at her photos. When i looked at them i noticed that i got restless for some fucking reason. Im not even sure but i think i felt like something bad was going to happen to her or i felt jealous.

bff of 5 years blocks me and refuses to speak to me,3,ml3yid,0,"TW: suicidal thoughts, friendship conflicts, swearing, abandonment 

my best friend (L) (20f) and i (21f) got into a really bad fight almost two months ago. i need to objectively know if i am being exhausting. we got into a heated argument all because of a scheduling conflict. she accused me of replacing her with another close friend of mine (K), which could not be further from the truth. both of these friends are of equal importance to me. it was my birthday and K and i were supposed to go out for drinks but we had to reschedule due to bad weather. unfortunately, we had to reschedule for the following day, when i was supposed to see my best friend. the plans with L were never set in stone, and we never had a time set. however, L initially was not bothered by the possibility of rescheduling and was actually excited because we planned on bringing another mutual friend (B) with us that upcoming weekend. B was coming from out of state. i thought this would be a great idea so that L, B, and i could go all go out to eat together and catch up! a few days pass, and L completely switches up on me. during these few days she was still sending me memes and shit like normal. the day before we have plans to go she starts accusing me of shit like, “you’re replacing me with K because she lives closer,” “you’re throwing me away for someone you’ve only known for a few months” (K and i were coworkers for a long time), “you only see me when it’s convenient for you” (i offered to drive out to her not that long ago but her boyfriend said he didn’t want any company at the last minute), and she just kept making me feel awful and brought me to tears. my mom heard me on the phone with L and wanted to know what was going on. she says, “L stop treating (me) like shit. She’s sitting here crying” and L says, “well it didn’t sound like she was crying. you’re invalidating MY feelings.” we were so shocked tbh. honestly, i could go on and on but that’s the gist of it. shit just kept getting worse. ultimately, she ended up blocking me, which she knows is a HUGE trigger for me. i apologized a million times, my mom tried to talk to her, my boyfriend tried to talk to her, everything. she won’t speak to me. she absolutely hates me and says i invalidated her feelings. she sent one of her friends after me, and her friend just annihilated me about how i’m such a shitty person to do this to L. tbh, i don’t even know what i’m apologizing for, but i feel like i did SOMETHING wrong. i have tried calling her and texting her multiple times but nothing. i am absolutely devastated and questioning everything, especially since we have  had a tumultuous past with arguing. however, it’s never been this bad. she always gets mad at me, and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong. i’m sorry if this made actually no sense, but i’m really having a hard time. i feel like i’m an awful person, and i just feel so sorry for everything. i wish i could redo everything. even if you just took the time to read this, thank you."

But these feelings also feel kinda real. I desperately need any ounce of support. My boyfriend and I have been together for nearly 5 years now. I suffer from BPD, and he’s been the person I’ve been co-dependent on throughout our relationship. He suffers with depression/anxiety and possible other mental health issues.

We moved into his hometown together in May of last year and got our first apartment in July. I have been the one paying the bills and rent this entire time since then. I’ve been unemployed up until a month ago, barely keeping everything afloat by driving for delivery services. my mental health problems have worsened significantly and i’ve been going through the worst episode i’ve ever had since then. he has not been working or doing anything to progress with his life, he tells me that it is his mental health in the way. he has not gotten the help he needs despite telling me he will. he tells me that he doesn’t want to be this way and that he doesn’t want to keep hurting me and watching me struggle but he can’t seem to muster up the courage to go get help. i’ve been patient for so long and giving everything i can to show him that i support him, mothering everything he does even. i’m so unhappy. he tells me that he loves me so much and i believe him but i also believe that he’s codependent on me as well.

I feel like i’m in an eternal struggle right now. I feel so much resentment towards him and I’m not sure if i’m even attracted to him anymore, but I also feel like I need him. I’m not sure if i’m in love with him or if i despise him or both. he’s incredibly sweet towards me but at the same time kind of mean towards me and i don’t like who he’s becoming. i want to have hope that he’ll someday get the help he needs and it’ll be okay. i want to be believe that he’s the love of my life and that he’s still the guy i fell in love with because he does still have those great qualities but is hurting me so bad at the same time. i’m afraid to leave because he’s all i’ve ever known for the past 5 years. i’m afraid of being alone. i’m afraid of regretting my decision. i’m afraid of life never being the same. i’m actually terrified that i won’t make it. what if i never find anybody better. i think i actually love him. i don’t know. i feel crazy. i’m sorry"

I know they're required to ask. I just hate being asked a yes/no question to which the answer is always yes. Just start asking me if I'm planning, for crying out loud."
I'm so sick of everything.,5,ml2ee6,1,"I don't know what to do anymore. I'm trying to stay single since I don't want another relationship where I'm absolutely fucking terrified and crying over not being good enough for them every single day, and it hasn't been exactly hard since I believe I am absolutely unlovable inside and out, but I can't get rid of the longing I feel for connection and it's tearing me apart.  

I have no friends, the ones I had left me or we fell apart for one reason or another, no support system since my family doesn't give a fuck, I'm pursuing a worthless degree and already worrying about how I'm going to feed myself, right as I thought I was doing better mentally I fall into a hole again.

I can't afford therapy either, and I don't believe anyone can in my country unless they're super rich, so there's no chance of DBT for me either. What do I do? What the fuck is the point? I have so many thoughts daily about wanting to end it all. But there's so much shit I want to experience still, I'm 22 and all my years have been wasted because of my mental health and it's all. so. upsetting. 

I feel so alone. What do I do? I just want to feel okay."
It scares me how far I’m willing to go for my FPs,21,ml27xd,3,"I would do anything and everything they want to be loved. I would do awful things if it meant that they would stay with me. I have had 3 FPs but my first is really the one that I can’t let go off even after almost a decade. I know it’s wrong for me to put another person on a pedestal and think they’re going to love me and my life is going to be perfect. But I would do anything to be loved I’m so pathetic, if they give me one ounce of hope I will cling to that for life. I want to do anything and everything Idec if they don’t want me I just want to be there and be liked. I’m so awful."
Constant worry about BPD,0,ml26dv,1,"Ive recently read the symptoms of BPD and now I cant get the thought of it out of my head. I have constant anxiety/panic that I have this disorder. I fear it. Im scared that im not the person I thought I was. Im scared  constantly. 

Ive had anxiety/panic disorder for about 10 years. Its always been health related. There were times in the past where I had convinced myself that I had some sort of cancer or was schizo. These panic episodes would last weeks. My anxiety has always been ""breathing"" related. I would constantly search for that satisfying breath feeling. If I didnt get it, id panic for about 20 minutes.

Most recently, I had an episode of ""not getting a satisfying breath"" that lasted much longer than normal and that really got my anxiety going again. So much that I started to see a therapist, who suggested I have OCD. After about 3 weeks I started to feel better. 

Now, due to anxiety about recently becoming a father. I started to google why im not attached to my baby. Why I felt some anger and resentment towards him. I convinced myself that im a psycopath and theres no helping me. Reason being, I hurt cats as a kid. I have so much guilt and hate myself for it. Im a total animal lover now. I wish I could undo what I did as a kid. I wish I could go back in time and show nothing but love to those cats that I beat. But even with this guilt, I convinced myself im a psycopath. Im afraid that when im angry ill hurt my son.

 It went from bad to worse when I read about BPD. For 4 days now ive constantly been worrying and panicking that I have this disorder. Here are some of my symptoms :

-Fear abandonment : GF goes out of town, I panic, I feel alone. During high episodes of anxiety, ive cried on her lap asking her not to leave me because of my anxiety.

-Hypersexuality : I have a GF whom I love. We have a great sex life. But im constantly thinking about sex with other women. Even shortly after having sex with her. Im constantly aroused. I look at almost every attractive woman that passes me by, and I think about having sex with them. I had previously thought that this is just how all, or most men think. Ive never cheated on my GF. And the times Ive ""thought"" about it, I felt guilt. I told myself no way I could ever hurt her. Ill admit I like being flirtatious with women. But I wont ever actually cheat on her.

-Perfectionism : I organize my entire apartment the way I want it. Every detail of it. I constantly clean and wipe down counters, organize clutter, and place things where I want them to be. 

-Impulsive : Ive gone on some pretty bad spending sprees. Again didnt think anything abnormal about it because I feel like I manage my money well. But if I set my mind on something, I feel like I have to have it. Ive bought myself a lot of crap that I dont need recently.

-low self esteem : Im overweight. I constantly think about getting into shape but never do. I dont feel confidenent that I can accomplish much outside of what ive already done.

-Hear whatever I need to hear : Im not a good listener. When someone is speaking, im already planning my next words. This is especially true during arguments with my GF. I feel like Im always right. She has even pointed this out to me in the past.

-Ive had recent memory lapses. I can be a little sarcastic at times. I have mood swings and feelings of emptimess. 

Like I said im seeking therapy over the next couple of days. Id just like some input here."
Whats y'alls Myers Briggs Personality Types?,13,ml21yz,44,"I know anything 'Personaltiy' test, quiz, etc can be different for someone with a personality disorder but in all honesty, if you have ever take the Myers Briggs Personality Type test, what was your personality type?

Out of pure boredom, I have taken the test about 4 or 5 times(with periods of time in between each). Each time I got a different personality type and half of the ones i recoeved as my personality type i didnt feel really fit me that well.

Im curious."
DAE feel so numb you have completely disconnected?,4,ml1qq5,5,DAE feel this? I have days where I am so disconnected from my body. I feel like I am floating around in my head and I pretty much have no connection or sensations from my limbs. I guess my whole body feels super numb along with my head.
just came to me that no one will ever care for me the way that i do them,2,ml1q7f,0,i know i should accept that people react and show affection differently but it kills me i get so annoyed at how everyone constantly doesn’t show their emotions i try my hardest to prove to people in my life that i love and care for them so much but they never do the same?? it’s at a point that they never even remember a thing i tell them about myself i know i can’t expect everyone to be like me and show affection like me but it’s so annoying because i’m always the one to rush to help and care honestly now i’m avoiding meeting anyone because i know they’ll leave or make me feel like shit i go out of my way to do things for people to make them know i love them but no one ever does the same for me it’s so upsetting
How do I stop freaking out,1,ml1cjl,1,"I have been a complete wreck recently. I have been unable to focus on the smallest task, I’ve been cutting myself more and more, and my thoughts have become more abstract and self harming. Within the last hour, i have thought

- I want to smack my head into the sidewalk and crack my skull open. I don’t want to die, I just want to feel the pain
- I want to break everything around me
- I want to shave off all my hair
- I want to cut off my fingers
- that there was someone behind me (I live alone)
- (this one is a bit weird to explain) my thoughts were smooth (like my head felt like it was a hard boiled egg, clogged and uniform)
- jumping off a bridge into a suicide net to see how long it would take for people to see me
- etc

There has been so much screaming in my head its impossible to focus on any task and I exhaust and stress myself out so much that I don’t have the energy to do anything once these episodes are over. Is there anything I can do to help mitigate or stope these thoughts and feelings? Im currently between therapists, don’t have meds, and have no one to talk to irl."
I can't take Twitter anymore,7,ml19k3,12,"I wasn't sure to make or not this post but I'm bursting with bad emotions. 
Twitter triggers every and all negative feelings on me. I can't do it anymore. I did an account solely for following some cc's I like. 
Everyday and everytime I saw stupid people and unfair discussions. It makes so angry. So absolutely mad, it physically drains me.
 I'm holding back tears right now, it exhausts me so much. I just deleted my account, I don't plan to go back. I feel so sad for all the people being targeted, all the injustice, lack of love, lack of respect. 
How can people be able to treat others with so little compassion? I don't get it, I hate it. And I hate how it affects me so much. Today was the last straw.
I hope one day people learn how to be actually good people and not just plain rude and mean."
Sleeping it out,12,ml1854,3,"My boyfriend(non BPD) is a big believe in if we are arguing or disagreeing at night, to just go to sleep and see how we feel in the morning. The idea of this feels horrific to me (BPD)! He always says things are better in the morning. After forever of us fighting (basically me just having an episode) he kept trying to get me to lay down to sleep. I fought it and fought it because that's how my brain works but I eventually fell asleep. And HE WAS RIGHT! We were able to turn around, love on each other and talk. 
Is anyone able to do this? And did it work for you?
I don't have the confidence to say that I can do this often because my mind just doesn't ease. But I would like to be about to get to that point."
My empirical speculations,8,ml13oj,4,"This post is a work in progress.

I think my BPD boils down to:

* High sensory processing
* Childhood neglect and insecure attachment
* Issues with the hippocampus – which helps regulate behavior and self-control
* Severe executive-dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex (which is involved in planning and decision making) and overactive amygdala which is normally regulated by the PFC and plays an important role in regulating emotions, especially the more ""negative"" emotions, such as fear, aggression and anxiety

I don't see how it could be anything else but these. Every other issue ties back to them. I suspect these are core to many cases, with the last one being seriously underestimated.

I'm thinking about Robert Sapolsky, his work on Free Will and book called '[Behave](https://fourminutebooks.com/behave-summary/)' in relation to all this. Also the book Good Reasons for Bad Feelings. I'm interested in the physical, biological aspects and the implications for personal responsibility.

[Another 'Behave' summary](https://growth.me/books/behave/#1-the-triune-brain-model-your-brain-is-part-reptilian-part-emotional-and-part-neocortex)

The trouble is, because it expresses as behaviours and not things like tremors in Parkinson's or forgetting in Alzheimer's, people find it hard to acknowledge or consider.

From Wikipedia:

>**Brain Abnormalities**  
>  
>A number of neuroimaging studies in BPD have reported findings of reductions in regions of the brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion, affecting the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala, amongst other areas. A smaller number of studies have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of BPD patients, looking specifically at neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, glutamate-related compounds, and choline-containing compounds.  
>  
>Some studies have identified increased gray matter in areas such as the bilateral supplementary motor area, dentate gyrus, and bilateral precuneus, which extends to the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The hippocampus tends to be smaller in people with BPD, as it is in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, in BPD, unlike PTSD, the amygdala also tends to be smaller. This unusually strong activity may explain the unusual strength and longevity of fear, sadness, anger, and shame experienced by people with BPD, as well as their heightened sensitivity to displays of these emotions in others. Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress.  
>  
>**Executive Function**  
>  
>While high rejection sensitivity is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder, executive function appears to mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms. That is, a group of cognitive processes that include planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts BPD symptoms. A 2008 study found that the relationship between a person's rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher. This suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of BPD. A 2012 study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with BPD."
Am I just stupid,1,ml11dk,8,I need to know if I'm just stupid of if my boyfriend and I just aren't meant to be. We have opposite views on a lot of thing. One big one that is causing huge fights is that he thinks I can't talk to other boys because he thinks ill cheat. I think I should be able to talk to whoever as long as its just friendly conversation. But I don't know if I'm just being stupid. Like I can't have a fulfilling relationship and get to talk to whoever I want.
Feeling emptier than usual. Looking for someone to relate.,3,ml10pg,6,"I have always struggled with self identify. It’s like I never see myself as being “normal” like everyone else. 

I lost my bf/best friend about 7 months ago. He couldn’t take all the bpd symptoms anymore. I want to blame him but I understand how much I put him through. 

I can’t be myself around anyone else. When I was with him I felt whole. What’s worse is that we were friends for 12 years before dating. Now that he’s gone I’ve lost all that history and comfort too. 

I’ve been suicidal before, but never successful. I just wish I could contact him somehow but he’s erased himself completely from the planet basically. I’m not sure if he’d even know if I was gone and I feel mostly gone already."
Working full time can be far too difficult,4,ml0log,1,"I work full time at a warehouse job where all I do all day is fix broken packages and send them back out. A lot of the time the packages are very heavy and by the second half of the shift I’m physically exhausted. It’s a very unfulfilling and laborious job that especially bothers me because it has nothing to do with the degree I pursued in college. I’m wanting to find a better job but I need to wait until I can afford to fix my laptop first. Due to my diagnosis of both BPD and bipolar disorder I deal with constant intense mood swings that I only just got medication to curb, and last week I went into my boss’s office holding back tears saying I was too depressed to work that day and had to go home. Thankfully he understood, but I don’t know how tenable holding down this job will be in the future. I want to quit but I need to make sure I have another job secured first, since I live on my own and far from home."
Fml,3,ml0lib,1,I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate my anger. I hate everything. I might not deserve anything that’s why bad shit happens to me this fucking illness that makes me a really hateable person everybody around me only caring about other peoples feelings and not mine
Thinking about my former FP alot.,1,ml0hqt,1,"I think about her almost every day. I just recently got my diagnosis, and it feels so fucked up. I just look back and see everywhere it went wrong. I can see everytime I split on her and caused her pain. I just wish there was a way to make it up to her, but not everything has a happy ending. Its the complete lack of control and abilty to deal with my emotions that really bothers me when I think about it. I miss her, but I know she hates me. I genuinely dont know where im going with this, I just needed to get it out."
New therapist. Only concerned with payment,0,ml0gw6,3,"So I went to a therapist today because my psychiatrist recommended her. She emailed me leading up to it that I needed to figure out my copay and deductible. No big deal.. I did. We got on the zoom and she said, so I’m going to tell you about myself, you’re going to tell me why you’re here, and then we’ll deal with payment. 

She seemed nice, but fuck.. payment seemed to be the number one goal. Am I crazy to think she’s just money hungry?"
"I’m lost. Tried to get into two different residentials, both of which denied me for my physical health.",2,mkzdnh,2,"So I went to Acute and we made a plan for IOP.
Then I got denied IOP because my mental health is so unstable I was told I needed residential. 
Then we went through a long admissions process, only to be told that I didn’t qualify because I have a chronic illness in addition to my mental illnesses.
So then I found a second place and they said the same fucking thing.
I’m so lost and I have nowhere to go. Fuck my life. Back to self harm we go I guess. I can’t cope anymore."
How do you live with knowing you're a bad person?,21,mkza29,22,"I am not in danger to myself, but it's so hard to live with knowing you're a bad person. Knowing you've hurt people. There's a woman who didn't answer me for a while and I kept asking if she's mad, she insisted she isn't mad and then blocked me on everything. It's small things like that, but they happen all the time. I mean she said I wasn't bothering her and she wasn't mad, so I kept saying hi occasionally. And I am not blaming BPD, I just dunno where else to post this. And another time I accidentally stole a $3 box of cereal from the grocery store. I have messaged other people, a lot, because I thought they were mad.

I feel like a monster. Like if Dexter was real he'd take me out.

I have an internship coming up (photography) and the first woman often works with the person I am interning for. If I happen to meet her I won't say anything, but I feel like if I lose my coop because of this then..well, of course, it's my fault. No way around that.

I've been messaging everyone I've hurt and writing them an apology. Not a half-assed apology either. A good apology. I found a podcast on apologies and I used that to help me. I wrote one tonight and the person blocked me instantly. I hate that I used to make people uncomfortable.

It's so hard to live with all the pain I've caused so I developed new rules. 1) I cannot make friends. if I make friends, people will get mad at me. 2) I should stick to still life and product photography while I unfuck my brain. I love portraiture, but if I can't message people without asking if they're mad at me, then I shouldn't be messaging people.

I apologize that some parts here are vague."
How I felt last night vs this morning are POLAR OPPOSITES,12,mkz9sj,2,"Last night I finally faced the emotions I’ve been pushing aside all week. I cried until I couldn’t breathe. 

I somehow convinced myself that the right thing to do was to message my FP, who essentially decided we should just be acquaintances 3 weeks ago because we were hurting each other. Last night, I was convinced I should tell him I was in love with him. That I’m sorry for hurting him and that I would be blocking him because I love him too much to keep myself from speaking to him or waiting for him to speak to me. I really, 100% felt convinced that that was what I needed to do for closure. The thought felt so liberating and RIGHT. 

However, I didn’t do it. But not because of any conscious change in my outlook. I exhausted myself crying and fell asleep once I was done.

This morning I woke up feeling mildly sick at the mere thought of what I would have done. NO part of me feels like that was a good idea anymore. I would have felt so ashamed after opening myself up to and forcing my emotions onto someone who clearly rejected me and wants nothing to do with me, and who was hurt by my actions. 

The problem I’m having is how much it scares me that I can have such POLAR OPPOSITE THOUGHTS in such a short period of time. I can’t trust myself to believe in anything I feel. I can’t trust myself to do what’s best. I can’t trust myself to believe in me or make the right choices for me. I have no real compass. I don’t know who I am anymore. With every fiber of my being I’d felt like messaging him was the right choice last night. Not to try to get him back, but just to be honest and open. And the me this morning is disgusted by the possibility... who the hell am I?"
I got my heart broken and it’s all my fault,8,mkz6wm,6,"There’s this guy who I started hooking up with a couple months ago. I thought I could do a strictly FWB type relationship, but I ended up getting emotionally invested(who would’ve thought) 
These feelings were unrequited, of course, but I felt like I could live with it, since he still wanted to fuck. Plus, I know that I’m in no place to start a relationship, so I thought this hookup would be liberating. Regardless, my heart had other plans, and my heart chose him. 
A couple days ago, he tells me there’s another girl he wants to get serious with, ultimately ending whatever sexual relations we had. It felt like this man had ripped my heart out of my chest. Yes, I saw heartbreak coming from a mile away and yes, I knew that this type of relationship is not something I’m good at handling. I went on with it anyways, and now I’m here, feeling like absolute shit. 
I’m going through a really fucking rough time right now, and he promised me he still cares about me and we’d still be friends. He says I can come to him anytime for anything, whenever I need him. He even came to my house to check up on me and talk, because he knows how much this shift in our relationship affected me, on top of everything else I’m dealing with. 
At first, trying to get over it was hard. I turned to self harm, weed, and alcohol to help me cope. I convinced myself that if I couldnt have him in that way, why have him in my life at all. I got rid of all contact with him, and decided to move on with my life. About a day later, I realized that he’s a good person and a valuable friend to have. After a day without talking, I finally replied to him and we actually had a great conversation. That night, I went to a party for my friends birthday, hung out with other guys, and thought I’d be fine just being friends. All was well. 
Until just a couple moments ago. I checked his story, and it’s a photo of the aforementioned other woman. They’re on a sushi date. Seeing that actually physically affected me. My chest fucking hurts as if someone just punched me right in the heart. I felt like screaming, sobbing, punching my wall, etc. I felt like I was gonna pass out. 
This all fucking sucks because I was actually having a good day today, then this fiasco completely flipped my mood. Now it feels as if I’m back in the dark hole I just finished clawing my way out of. I start to feel dizzy just thinking about that fucking picture.
I feel pathetic, desperate, worthless and fucking stupid. This shit makes me hate myself. I feel like an absolute loser. I’m convinced I’ll never find someone who loves me as much as I love them. Im convinced there will always be someone better, and I’m just a temporary placeholder for those who are on the way to finding someone much more fitting for them."
I dont know if/how I could hold on longer,3,mkyjcr,2,"I currently have been doing work for a call center at a luxury company. I hate it so much. I've been doing it since August 2020. It's remote which I should be thankful for. Every shift feels like I'm dragging my feet. Today I just couldn't do it. There's been other days like today but today it was like I couldnt even just sit there and not do the work. Sometimes I slack off and it's fine but I hate the phone calls so much--I haven't done them at capacity for awhile which I feel guilty for. Days they have me do other tasks I feel better, but when i've asked to be put on other stuff more they say ""it all depends on capacity"". I've been looking for a new job since I started 

Every job I've found I get to the final stages of interviews and it falls through, even if I think the interview went well there's always someone better. Today I found out I officially didn't get a big job I was excited about after following up (I got to the point that I knew because I hadnt heard from them for a while)  but it still hurts. I had done an internship there before and it was for the ultimate entry level thing. 

I just feel like I'm never going to get out of my job. I would love to quit but I cannot get unemployment if I quit. I know I'll feel like shit if they eventually fire me, but I think that's the only path to unemployment. 

It just feels like I'm always tipping over the edge and I feel like shit all of the time. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, I just wanted to vent and seeing stories of people relating helps me. I just don't know if I can do it much longer."
newly diagnosed,4,mkyfky,5,"just got diagnosed officially w bpd last week. my psychiatrist suspected for a while that i might have it and though i knew it was a very likely possibility i guess i wasn’t truly prepared to hear that i really do have it?? although it feels good to finally know for sure that i have bpd i can’t help but feel overwhelmed and so fucking scared???? i don’t want to be a burden for the rest of my life. i have other mental illnesses along w bpd and i’m struggling to accept it all even though i’ve been very open about my mental health for many years??? it just feels weird i guess.
what helped u guys accept yourselves after u got diagnosed?? would rlly appreciate some advice <333 thank u !!"
DAE have PMDD and BPD? DAE have more severe symptoms while taking BC? It’s been years before I considered this???,2,mkyb6q,9,"
Bottom line up front: has anyone with PMDD and BPD taken birth control- or had a hormonal IUD and it made symptoms way worse? Could I actually be much better after I stop BC?

background: a few years ago I got a hormonal IUD put in. I’ve never taken birth control before. At the same time I was going through a LOT. Workplace (military) abuse, family abandonment, my best friend in the ICU... I have BPD, right, so I never considered that my IUD might be *worsening* any symptoms. I just thought it because I was being triggered by all of this.

I had periods only twice-ish a year before BC. During PMS I would get SEVERELY, consistently suicidal, compulsively self harming, with more psychotic symptoms too. I’m not diagnosed with PMDD (but I mean, I feel I have something like that...)

Anyway, now I’m taking a BC pill along with my recently expired IUD at my gynecologist’s recommendation (insurance issue) so that’s a lot of hormones.

I am MARKEDLY worse, beginning from the same week that I started the pill. Even worse than I typically am. Double worse. I have periods twice a month and I’ve been on the edge of being admitted on and off since I started the pill. 

Does anyone have a problem with birth control? If I get my IUD removed and stop taking the pill, do I have hope of maybe relieving some of this constant AGONY? :( could I be right?"
Brain on fire?,15,mky21i,1,Does anyone else feeling like they are on fire constantly and just want to jump out of their skin? I am so uncomfortable being in my own mind and body that if I could physically just jump out of my own skin I would. Not because of body image issues or anything but just the fact that I am very uncomfortable just being alive.
Friendships,1,mkxzen,1,"Hi guy's,

Just wondering if anyone else experience this. I get really obsessed with my friends and if they even are like ten min late cause there doing something  for someone else I get so angry and jealous and feel like they hate me. I find it hard to control my  jealousy  with them"
Being trans with BPD is wild.,19,mkxy58,4,"Being on hormone replacement therapy, essentially going through puberty again in my mid-20’s, is challenging in and of itself. That alone could give me a lot of the mood swings and such that look like BPD.

Thing is, I’ve had BPD since loooong before then. So this is nothing new. It’s just that little bit extra now. Instead of just savagely beating up on myself for the people I’ve hurt and my directionless life, now it’s all that *plus* my mind screaming internalized hate at me. “You’re not real, you’re just manipulating people into going along with your charade, you don’t deserve this after the pain you’ve caused others, give up and be miserable.”

Therapy, as well as some pretty heavy anti-anxiety/anti-depressants, have been helping, but still. I already have had a hard enough time accepting myself for the 20+ years I hid in the closet, having BPD’s challenges on top of it makes it all feel extremely heavy."
I self sabotaged everything in my life in the span of a day,8,mkxrkb,6,"My roommate is threatening to kick me out and I’m on a performance plan at my job. I’m not the type of person to make excuses for myself, but this sucks. I drank myself into a stupor last night and left my living room a mess. I cleaned it up, but my roommate says she wants to discuss my lease and she’s pissed. I’ve called out of work because I can’t muster the energy to get out of bed so many times that I’ve been placed on a Performance Plan (AKA one more mess up and you’re fired.) My parents have distanced themselves because I’m a walking dumpster fire, and it’s all my own fault."

The worst of the WORST of my suicidal thoughts, going in and out from extreme emotional distress to complete numbness, and the most distorted sense of self. It’s equally devastating each time it happens and it always seems to completely come out of the blue despite me knowing it will happen. Does anyone else who menstruates experience anything similar?"
DAE have physical symptoms with BPD?,5,mkwj1t,7,"
My question: so I haven’t been diagnosed with BPD yet and I’m going back to the doctor on Thursday. Does anyone have physical symptoms that come with the BPD? For example, dizziness, lightheadedness, room spinning sensation, severe nausea, “brain zaps”, vision problems (like everything looks “shiny” or blurry), heart palpitations. 

Context: I’ve had a ton of problems with mental illness since childhood and was first treated when I turned 17, as a punishment. “You’re acting up, so clearly you need mental help”. 

I’ve been treated for anxiety (GAD, social anxiety, and OCD) and depression, and more recently Bipolar. I’ve had horrible luck with psychiatrists- they mostly just listen to me say “well I think I have bipolar, anxiety, etc because of x,y,z” and then give me meds for that diagnosis.  Therapy has helped on and off but it’s mostly just coping skills that don’t really help when my physical symptoms are so bad.

Basically, I’ve never had relief from my symptoms.  So recently, I’ve looked into BPD: I’ve done some research, found that I relate to a lot of the indicators, and I found this group and relate to a lot here as well, more than anything I’ve previously been diagnosed with."
Do you guys realize how strong we are ?,519,mkwiyu,43,"We are one of the strongest human beings on the planet. Think about it,  it took me a long time to realize that. To wake up everyday and fight and fight and fight every second of the day is remarkable. We all know it can get unbearable at times , but no matter how many times we cry, or we hurt, or anything we always manage to get through it. So I just wanted to say that. I love every single one of you guys. We're all kind hearted people fighting a never ending war but at the end of the day we always win the battle (:"
Probably getting dropped by therapist,4,mkwe3u,6,"My therapist used to let me text him on a regular basis... fucked that up by losing my temper more than once... now we have an agreement that I can email as needed, but I still get overwhelmed and impulsive, sending emails that insinuate suicide sometimes... I don't even realize that I've crossed a line sometimes, and other times suicide really is on my mind... ALOT... I have to respect his boundaries, but I'm very timid in sessions, so alot of what I really feel never actually gets said... hence writing it down in email or previously in texts... I'm sure he's tired of me because, well, I'm tired of me. How do I stop being so impulsive??? I just want to feel better."
"I am me, myself and I - and nothing else",6,mkwdmp,2,"First of all: I am doing fine. Not like everything is all flowers, rainbows and all is perfect, but I am doing well. No self-harm for over a year, my eating disorder's practically nonexistent now, my last therapy (after several therapies and a total of about 7-8 years in therapy) ended with my therapist calling me ""officially cured"" (do not fit the clinical criteria anymore), no suicidal ideation (sometimes thoughts, but fleeting, not permanent + I do know, I want to live) and a few months ago I ended a toxic relationship thinking: I am worth more than being someone else's punching bag. Great progress all in all even though I do feel down whenever I feel myself relapsing into old bad behaviour (towards myself or others). Still, I think everything's rather normal with small outbursts of ""unusually emotional stuff"" when it comes to bad memories and triggers. So there I am and I want to kind of get something out of my system here as I feel like this really did help me: I lost the label. I stopped more or less identifying myself with BPD.

Quite frankly, I've been through several long therapies and therapists always were uncomfortable with telling me their diagnosis. Sometime they usually did, but all of them were different anyhow. As someone who was doing relatively well in life, most didn't see a real problem with me and I on the other hand had that constant feeling of having to ""prove"" my pain to them. This ended up with me someday shedding all those labels. I was sick of them and annoyed to high heaven with how a lot of people thought they knew me based on what I was diagnosed with or others who thought they could constantly make things my fault, because that's what pwBPD do, don't they? Fuck things up with people, because they have this need to do this.

This constant denial of my own reality made me stay in abusive friendships and later on also relationships for way too long. And as one therapist thought it'd be good for me to meet other people with similar struggles (so other people with BPD), I tried an online support group. That's when I truly realized how crippling that label was (any psychological label in general actually). It was always ""BPD this, BPD that"" for everyone. Of course, there are patterns and I am glad that I can see them clearly now and have been actively working against them, BUT it's not like this is ingrained in my bones. It's not as if this is who I am.

I can explain my behaviour, but so can anyone else who is not experiencing the results of year-long abuse and neglect. They simply have less extreme outcomes to deal with. They might yell at someone out of the blue, because the bus today was late, then they got splashed with cold water, then it started raining and the umbrella they brought suddenly disappeared and now they've got a stressful meeting to get to and the barista at the coffee shop is just so slow that they are in danger of being late to this highly important meeting and suddenly they explode and scream at a person who has done nothing wrong, but meet them at the wrong day. You go back all those steps and any sane person would say: ""Yeah, that's truly understandable. You poor thing!"", but without that info, most will just be like: ""What an asshole!""

I guess, what I am trying to say here is: Please do not put too much emphasis on your diagnosis and try to find in any and every reaction or behaviour of yours a sign of how this is BPD and this is you being a bad/inherently evil or even broken/defective person. It was an immense relief for me to finally just acknowledge that nothing I do, think or feel is in any way ""crazy"" considering my messed up past with people using and abusing me in all kinds of different ways. This however does come also with the responsibility of saying: ""I am the master of my own life."" And I am also not always blameless. Just like any other human being I've hurt others and I've made mistakes. Something my therapist and friends also continued to tell me: I wasn't in control of things in the past and there was nothing I could do as a kid, but I am not a child anymore. No matter how unfair it might have been to me, there is no way around to finding the adult in myself without having had parents to help me grow up in a healthy way. I didn't have a childhood and will never have one - period. But that doesn't mean, I am unable to have a great life from hereon forth. I honestly hate feeling all this responsibility, to be completely honest. The child in me hates it. But it's good. It's healthy. It's what I need to do. And I think somewhere deep within it's what is hard for each and everyone: To truly grow up.

I used to have such a fragile ego from all that anger and lashing out at me in my family that I couldn't take even the smallest of criticism, thinking: ""Why does everyone want to hurt me? Haven't I suffered enough?"" To be honest, I still sometimes feel pretty shitty, thinking, I want to just be able to jump into someone's arms, be cuddled and told that everything is gonna be ok and that they would make sure to treat me well, but I've realized that this is especially the child in me who wants their childhood filled with security and unconditional love. But I need to grow up into a respectable adult, knowing that I am me and only me and I need to take responsibility for this life of mine and everything I do. I still look through material on BPD and psychological illnesses, but I don't want to use those as excuses or explanations to others. I want to look at those things and think about what I for myself think I can change to be better for me and maybe someday future family that I might have.

Just felt like getting this out there.

I wish you all well and the best on your own journeys. Need to put some work into mine as well and continue doing this, but I am optimistic for a better life for all of us (and every human being in general) as long as we continue trying to make the best of this life of ours."
Wanting to communicate but too scared.,7,mkw0v8,0,"Does anyone struggle with wanting to communicate to close friends about feeing left out or ignored, but scared to look needy and selfish for saying so? It would explain my coldness and standoffish behavior lately.

Idk what to do anymore. I’ve tried snapping out of it. Being objective.

These thoughts and feelings are killing me. I just want them to stop and be a normal person."
Overthinking,2,mkvn8c,5,"My bf said they were gonna buy something the size up (something that makes them really happy and feel good) the next time they buy it and I literally just responded with ''okie!! They would both look so good!!''

Then said ''hopefully this one comes sooner!!''

I'm so insensitive and horrible I deserve to die.


Please someone help, was this bad and horrible of me???"
Does anyone else have a difficult time not feeling empty in a normal (ie non-toxic) relationship?,6,mkvjme,2,"I have a very hard time feeling pretty much anything when hanging out with relatively okay people. It's fine but for some reason, I just can't truly feel anything, not even towards them. It leads me into platonic and romantic relationships with people who are either outright abusive or are simply bad for me in some way (eg they have problems of their own that are simply totally incompatible with mine and it makes us both suffer). It's like I can't live unless I'm suffering and can't love unless I'm in fear. I don't know if I'm making any sense but it just feels like it's like what Keaton Henson said: ""I'm a writer who's nothing if he's not in Hell.""  I theorise that it's because I've never known normal relationships during my childhood and I guess it just profoundly affected something in me. 

But I'm wondering if anyone else is like this. It weighs heavily on my life and honestly, it is something that I find rather embarrassing to admit, so I'd like to know if I'm not alone in this and if anyone actually knows why this happens and if I can do anything about it."
DAE stop caring?,8,mkuwqa,0,"I feel like because I care so much about other people and about what they think of me, it gets to be overwhelming to the point where sometimes I need to turn it off. And when I turn it off, it is the best feeling in the world. I just don't give a fuck. I hate everyone. No one matters to me. Everyone can go fuck themselves, I just don't care. I feel free. I feel like I unshackled myself from the prison my mind keeps me in and I can run free. Not giving a fuck about what anyone thinks the the most free I've ever felt in my life. I love that feeling. It's my favorite feeling.

This is of course short lived. Because that crippling guilt creeps up and chains you back into the prison of your own mind making you feel ashamed for ever thinking those things. Making you feel stupid for believing you could be free. Making you feel bad for not caring about other people and their views of you."
Who am I supposed to tell my psychiatrist that I think I have BDP,1,mkuube,3,"I'm seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow. I don't know how to tell him that I think I have BPD. 
I think I'll say that an other psychiatrist say that I have dissociative (it's real) but I don't know how to start ?
Maybe saying to him that my actual medecine isn't working (paroxetine for my depression)
He's a bit old and rude, I'm scared that he said I'm not BDP because I'm almost 100% sure I have.
I'm studying psychology so I know (a bit) of the DSM V."
Advice Please. I feel like I’m deactivating,2,mkuqup,1,"I just had a long talk with my friends about a fight we’ve had the night before. I have never lashed out at this group before (I’ve gotten much better at controlling myself over time) but I threatened to cut all of them off because I thought they were shit talking me. They got super mad. 

I understood them being mad at me losing my temper but I didn’t get why they would care if I cut them off. I called with them and they explained why it hurt their feelings but I’m struggling to feel remorse over my threat. I do feel bad when I really think about it, but they keep telling me I need to trust them more and that upsets me. What if I don’t want to trust them? 


I feel bad for hurting them but I also feel like they shouldn’t be hurt by that comment. I kind of want to cut all of them off anyways. I feel like the friendship has run it’s course. But I know they consider me one of their best friends. But I don’t feel like they know the real me. When I told one of them I have BPD, they said they thought my “therapist is wrong”. Actual quote. If anything that proves how much they don’t know the real me...


I think i’m splitting right now. I usually have a lot of love for these people. A lot. But right now I feel like their relationship is draining me. Idk. How do I snap out of splitting? How do I stay motivated to put effort into a friendship? 

I used to be more anxiously attached but I feel like i’m moving towards more fearful avoidant because for the first time I feel like exiting relationships rather than feeling anxious about them ending. Idk. I know logically i’m being selfish. Advice please. Someone knock some sense into me. These are really good people, why doesn’t my brain want to accept that. Why don’t I feel like I miss them."
DAE feel empty most of the time?,11,mkujcr,0,"I tend to feel far away from my emotions. It feels like I experience a lot of my feelings from the outside--like there's a shell separating me from the things I feel. The only emotions I feel deeply are pain, sadness, and occasionally some forms of sexual desire. But things like happiness and such always feel so far away from me. It's not a terrible existence most of the time. I just say I feel ""good"" because I don't really feel bad, but I'm not feeling happy either (if this makes sense??)

This isn't always a thing. When I don't think about it too hard, I feel relatively okay. But if I do any form of deep dive into my own feelings, I suddenly feel so distant. I assumed this was a type of disassociation, but now I'm not so sure. It's just been frustrating lately because I've been trying to do a figure out my sexuality, but I can't really figure anything out because I don't know if I truly feel anything because I very rarely feel anything deeply."
Think I might have BPD according to my sister who’s a Psychiatrist.. Do you suggest I still get an official diagnosis somewhere?,1,mkuglt,3,"I was sexually abused as a child at ages 5-7 by my neighbor and have never told anyone except for my sister, I’ve had an eating disorder all my life (only 100 pounds & 5’5 right now but have absolutely no plans to change my ways..my eating disorder has been prevalent for about 7 years) and lastly all of my relationships last about one year; I end up completely ghosting relationships due to the fact I truly believed they never liked me and were going to leave anyway. 

I either love or hate someone and there’s really no in between. People who are status driven and somewhat narcissistic gravitate to me. 

I don’t know why but especially narcissistic men are very attracted to me until I lash out due to fear of abandonment (I’ve been cheated on in every real relationship I’ve been in). I didn’t do everything right in those relationships but my family says I choose toxic men but I’m not sure if it’s just me causing these problems. 

Let’s just say I’ve burned every bridge there is and currently I just did that with someone and I think I might need to seek treatment. I don’t know how things can change for me but has anyone had any success in therapy? 

(What’s weird is I’ve been to two therapists who’ve told me I definitely don’t have BPD but I’m extremely naive with people who are basically abusers/I should’ve seen the red flags)."
Not diagnosed with bpd but looking for someone who might relate? Splitting??,1,mkufsz,0,"So the start off, I am not diagnosed with bpd, and idk if I have it. I am currently diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ocd, tourettes, adhd, and ptsd. So no, I don't have BPD but I'm posting here because I've been experiencing something that from my understanding is a common experience in bpd, called splitting? At least I feel like that's what this is, I apologize if I'm misunderstanding what this really is. This is something that happens a lot but I guess I'm going to specifically talk about the last 24 hours that it's happened.

Pretty much the last couple days I have been head over heels for my boyfriend, I mean I always am but it's all I could think about was how much I loved him, how wonderful he is and wanting to tell him all the time how much I did, but then today something happened that really is seemingly insignificant but it was felt really hurtful and upsetting to me and immediately all I feel is resentment and a sort of bitterness toward him feeling like he only cares about himself and he doesn't care about me and I'm always there for him and he's never there for my type of shit, tho I feel like I know that's not true. But that the thing, I know this is illogical, I know that's it's ridiculously for my feelings to switch so intensely like that so quickly and I know by the end of the day or at least in a couple I'll be completely bad to thinking about how wonderful he is, and he really really is wonderful and I know that, but this happens, a lot more than I want it to and a lot more than I feel like is okay for it to be happening. So regardless of bpd, cause I can't say this is a symptom of that, for me cause idk if that's what I'm dealing with but I figured other people here might relate and might be able to share their experience with these kinds of feelings and what sort of triggers it I guess. I mean I suppose I know what triggers it but idk why it does. If that makes sense?"
age regression,3,mku9xx,2,"this is super embarrassing to talk about, i think i told like 3 people privately.
I've read that age regression is common in Bpd as coping mechanism but is there anyone who actually does it frequently?

it doesn't happen to me often but when stressed i sometimes do slip into ""little space"". which is, again, super embarrassing to admit for me personally, especially since im a man"
Impulsivity question,2,mku9rg,4,Has anyone here tried to take an antipsychotic in the medicine regimen and found that it made you more impulsive? I’ve tried abilify (2 mg and 5mg ) and seroquel (75mg) and I have had similar reactions w both. I also want to add that I don’t have much impulsivity problems off these meds. Just looking to see if anyone has had a similar experience
Nowhere to go. It’s okay as long as I don’t think. [21 m],7,mku6lz,7,"I don’t know how much of this has to do with my bpd. But here’s my vent:

On the last day of February, I impulsively packed my clothes and my camera, and drove east, away from my coastal SoCal hometown, without telling anyone.  I didn’t have a destination, I just followed what felt right. I ended up in Palm Springs, and being freshly 21, I drank a lot that week.  I had savings to last only like 10 days. I was searching for work in person  and online. Applying everywhere. 
I did yard work for an old guy. Hard stuff, spiky cacti. I was shaking at one point and he told me to stop and come inside. He gave me some water and made a sandwich. I hadn’t slept the night before and only had caffeine and Ritalin in me and it was obvious. 
The rest of that week was a blur. I didn’t get hired anywhere. I tried escorting (just hanging out) but the first guy didn’t pay and that discouraged me. At the end of the week I got in a fight with a good friend of mine and i realized she thinks I’m a burden.  She’s a raging narcissist anyway and had been gaslighting me into thinking my art was bad and that I’m not as smart as her for years now. 
I didn’t know what to do but I saw a wall in the distance with the word “art” on it.  Not very subtle.  So I started taking pictures, what I originally wanted to do when I set out on this trip: document the desert towns with a focus on the intersection of vintage and postmodern americana . 

And then I started being drawn toward Arizona. My best friend J lives there, and he’d invited me to come stay with him and his girlfriend several times. So I texted him and said I was coming. 
I ended up getting tired and sleeping in Salome, to his dissapointment.
 The next day I show up and meet his girlfriend, he’s not home yet so I talk to her for an hour or so.  We get along pretty well. J comes home and I say “hey bud,” and hug him. We all watched a movie that night. 

3 weeks go by in a blur. I got a job at a restaurant pretty fast: expo and host. 
And I feel close to both of them, J and his girlfriend. But also far away. Sometimes I’d feel  anxious and like I had to leave.  I wonder if they hate me. I gave them opportunities to tell me I have to leave. 
One time i went to Walmart with J and I started dissociating, or maybe it was a very quiet and low energy panic attack. I sat and stared at a stack of Pepsi boxes. He said I was being weird and went to the car. He called me and said “it’s been 20 minutes. Just stop. You can choose to get up.” 
I was having trouble speaking. But I managed to say “you’re a smart guy J, but you’re very stupid when it comes to stuff like this.” 
After half an hour I managed to get up, pay, and leave. I got in the car in silence, and it took me a while to realize J was taking the long way home, and then eventually realize not home at all. He was driving us into the mountain. It was maybe 10 pm. Neither of us were saying anything. I was still feeling unreal and meaningless. He pulled over and we both got out. It was a full moon. I followed alongside him, we walked down a trail in the forest, just for a little while. I couldn’t help but think it was funny that his solution to a friend having a panic attack was to drive them into the woods at night and then take them for a walk. Part of me was thinking once we got deep enough he was gonna take out his gun and dispose of me for being defective. I wasn’t scared at all though, and I wouldn’t have minded if he did shoot me. At some point he turned back and I did too. We got back in the car and he started driving. I managed to say “it’s really pretty out here..... thanks for taking me.”  
He said we could come back and take pictures or light fireworks sometime.  I appreciated him in that moment.  

Theres a guy at work I wanted to be friends with.  I’d hope to be scheduled to work alongside him, but eventually I realized that the days I worked without him I was actually happier.  
I made a friend outside work, he gave me a lighter. I  gave my number to a girl who works at Goodwill. She texted me a lot and I almost regret it. 
On April 2nd, a day late so as to avoid confusion, J and his girlfriend informed me that their landlord discovered my existence, and said it was a lease violation for me to be their longer than 2 weeks. It’d been 3 weeks.  They said I could stay a few more days. But I felt like I couldn’t.  The next morning I packed all my things and left for work. After I met up with lighter friend and he helped me find the cheapest motel online, and my phone wouldn’t charge so he gave me his charger, to keep.  I felt like I was using him.  I gave him some licorice and a cigarette.  I couldn’t stay at his place. I left 10 minutes later.  I texted goodwill girl. Couldn’t stay at her place either, she lives with her grandparents.  
 
J texted me asking if I was coming back. An hour later I texted back that I didn’t know. 
I couldn’t sleep that night, the motel made me anxious. 

The next day at work I told myself I was gonna ask Work Friend if he needed a roommate. Instead I quickly realized I was tired and slow and in a mood, and eventually he took me aside and told me that everyone thinks I’m high. I hated that. I wasn’t high I was tired and  feeling like my life was pointless because I spent 3 weeks worth of pay on 1 week of a motel room. It wasn’t sustainable, I was gonna have to go back to my hometown, and live with my family again.  Everyone was weird to me at work. Rude even. Telling me to snap out of it. Don’t stand around. Pay attention. I hated it. I’m smarter than them even with my brain underwater, they just don’t know it.  And I’m normally a very hard and fast worker.  Not even work friend seemed to be on my side after a while.  Later that evening I found him on Facebook (everyone in this town uses Facebook for some reason) and I texted him asking if he needed a roomate or knew anyone that did. He said he didn’t but he’d keep an “ear out” and I should try “Gregg’s List.”   That was the final feeling of defeat.   I wanted to just say “ I don’t think anyone understands that they’ll never see me again.... or worse, they understand and don’t care.”   I wanted him to know that he doesn’t have time to get to know me better.  But there’s no way to say that.  There’s no way to say a lot of the things I want to say without sounding crazy. 

I haven’t quite decided if I’m going to live in my car and continue going to work. Or if I’m going to go back home. I have until Saturday the 10th to decide, that’s when I check out of the motel.  

There’s nothing worth staying here for but there’s nothing worth going back home for. 
I really have nothing going for me. No one cares about me the right way or cares if I’m there or not. 

In some form, on a very fundamental level inside me, I’ve given up.


TLDR: I ran away to Arizona to stay with my best friend and his gf. It’s been a month.  I’m now homeless, or will be on Saturday. and no one at my job has fallen in love with me enough to take me in.  I feel like I’ve been playing a role this whole time and it’s all been in my head.

Update:  accidentally sliced my thumb open with an exacto knife trying to make a stencil for a bleach dye t shirt at a park. Started gently dropping and wiping  the blood on the drawing and it looked really good and at some point I realized that maybe something /is/ wrong .  It doesn’t need stitches I don’t think.  Just another obstacle on this journey to live a simple small town life ."
GF said its a courtesy to tell me anything,3,mku5n1,9,"My girlfriend decides to tell me that shes going to meet up with a friend this week. This friend only talks to my gf when her other friends are on bad terms with her. When her friend has no one else to lean on is when she calls my gf. I told my gf that this friend is a fake friend and only using her. That started a fight. My gf mentioned how she was doing me a courtesy by telling me her plans that she didnt have to tell me anything. I responded with yes you do, youre in a committed relationship, you have to be honest and open. She also said how i just want to control her. This is bringing me doubts again and i wish she would see what i see. I dont care if she has friends but that friend is not a real friend.

Am I in the wrong ? Its hard to recognize if im self sabotaging or its reality."
Feel like a monster,8,mktyrp,4,I thought my most recent ex was a narcissistic asshole who didn’t care about me and treated me like shit. I’m starting to think it was the other way around and I feel like utter crap. I feel like a monster. I wonder how often I blindly crush people. How can I ever change when I don’t even recognize what I’m doing in the moment and I am CONVINCED it’s the other person?
How to deal with an fp. Please I am drowning,3,mkts4r,6,"Me and this dude have been on this ride for over a year. 

I am head over heels for this man. The last few months I finally accepted that he would never change his mind on being with me (he rejoined the military and moved away) after begging and pleading for months to just give it a try. I still thought about him but I didnt cry everyday anymore.

I saw him around Xmas when he visited. I was ok then, but he just visited again this weekend. He stayed at my house for 3 days. Idk why this time was different. The sex is the best either of us have ever had. He kept calling me baby and darling. Idk it was just the best time.

He left yesterday. And per usual, like he does everytime he visits he just goes off the radar. No more baby, no more messaging me. He usually answers when I text him but the convos don't last long. He leaves me on open alot.

I am just so fucking sad. Idk why he acts like were together and then just disappears. I know he likes me alot, he was pretty sad when he had to move. But i have it stuck in my head that I can convince him to just try to be with me. I just want to try, but I know he won't. Im obsessed.

Im drinking again and crying all day. I dont want to feel like this but God I think I love this guy. How do I get it to stop? I dont want to cut him off because I dont want him out of my life."
DAE experience paranoia that isn't transient?,4,mksy94,0,"Long story short, I wanted to rent a room in an apartment that had four people currently living there. I met the tenant I'd be replacing, let's call him **Roomie 1,** and received a tour of the unit and property. I loved it! During the tour, he told me one of the roommates is a chef. Okay, cool :)

I researched the property afterward and found *another* listing for that same unit on a different site under one of the *other* roommates, and it was for a different room in that unit. Okay, that means there are multiple vacancies then, and not just one? I figured he'd tell me that.  I Google'd the roommate who posted *that* listing, let's call him **Roomie 2**, and the first search result was a chef— but he lives in a completely different state. This chef is kind of well-known where he's from, so I assumed **Roomie 1** was being deceptive about the living situation because why lie about the chef living there if he clearly is based somewhere else?

The chef's instagram also shows he clearly doesn't live in *this* state and never did, so then my mind convinced me they were *both* trying to pull a sublease scam on me or something. I looked online for every possible scam tenants could use against people looking to rent a room in their unit, and my mind just spiraled out of control. When **Roomie 1** texted or called me after he had the property manager send me the application, I just ignored him. I didn't even want to fill out the application because it'd mean putting my banking and credit info, which I worried would be stolen. 

Turns out the chef I found online isn't **Roomie 2**, and there's another person with the same name who lives here and is most likely the real **Roomie 2**. Had I just Google'd the name in the listing with the city and state, I would've known that from the beginning. DAE experience this intense level of paranoia and distrust for *everyone*, to the point that they become a PI and start over-analyzing everything and everyone's intentions? This is more than *those two people sitting on the park bench across from me are whispering* ***so it's 100% about me****.* This is *any apartment I show interest in* ***will be a scam.*** I feel awful now because **Roomie 1** was looking for someone to replace him because he has to move for a job. I just complicated that process because I'm a nutjob."
No longer his best friend on Snapchat,17,mksqrz,2,"No longer best friends with the guy I’m dating on Snapchat the emoji beside his name switched from ❤️ to 😊 today meaning we’re no longer each others best friends but he is mine and I’m not his, it shouldn’t be a big deal I’m just a little hurt he’s been talking to someone else more than me and I can’t help but overthink. any normal person wouldn’t even bat an eye at this but I’m here worrying if this is just something that’s leading up to him eventually leaving me which makes me just want to not talk to him ever again to prevent myself from being hurt i know is stupid wish I could control it"
How to apologize and also ask for an apology?,2,mksp79,3,"This probably seems really obvious but I’m having a hard time with it at the moment. I’m hoping once I get off work I can sit and try and look through my workbook but I don’t recall seeing something to deal with this.

Last night I got into an “argument” with a friend over voice chat. I only put it in quotations bc it was very low stakes but we were both snippy with each other. 

I absolutely understand what I need to apologize for and I want to, but I don’t know how to do that and also bring up that I would potentially like an apology as well? I’m concerned that it will come across as trying to make the issue about me and my upset feelings, instead of trying to reach a mutual understanding. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m just in my head too much, but any advice would be appreciated."
Partner always mad at or annoyed with me,5,mkskg5,8,"My boyfriend is annoyed with me most of the time. And no, this isn’t the “all or nothing” thoughts that most of us with BPD recognize. 

He has misophonia so when I’m chewing food, drinking a beverage, blowing my nose, cleaning my teeth etc, he’ll be annoyed. But it’s also just our communication style that isn’t working at all and resulted in physical altercations recently which I wouldn’t have predicted a couple of years ago. I feel like I can’t do anything right which is a huge trigger for me that brings back trauma and feelings of worthlessness resulting is suicidal thoughts. 

I try to find more information on aggressive behavior towards the partner with BPD but most are forums or articles about an aggressive partner with BPD. 

I tried therapy by myself but also couples therapy and give him articles to read about BPD and triggers but it’s only getting worse. My feelings of depression won’t subside and I’m just sad and tired, not being able to do regular tasks or achieve goals because of it. Resulting in more anger of the partner towards me because I’m not bringing enough to the table. I’m becoming desperate and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel really bad about myself and am convinced I can’t do anything right. I’ve been dissociating for a couple of days now, just to cope. 

Does anyone have any articles on anger towards someone with BPD? I’ve encountered it multiple times with different people causing traumatic experiences.

Edit: I’m the one with BPD, my BF has no psychological issues (that we are aware of)."
Routines,8,mksgvn,4,"Does anyone else have strict routines they create for themselves? I follow mostly the same routine each day depending on the day of the week. Foods go with certain days of the week. I follow the exact same morning schedule to the minute. More or less I do the same things in the same ways every day and I do not get bored. In fact, if I’m unable to do my routines I feel very thrown off and unstable. I wonder if anyone else creates routines for safety and the illusion of control?"
I’ve cut most of the people I know off,79,mksecv,36,"I finally deleted my accounts. I think it’s best that I don’t talk to people and become a ghost. I need to fix myself and my issues before I go back to talking to anyone again. It’s for the best for the people I know, it was becoming difficult to stay alone and not make it their problem constantly. I think the hardest part is to come, but i can’t live with basing my mood on one person, constantly worrying why they won’t talk to me or if they hate me. It unfair to them. I just want to learn to live with myself, and not need validation from anyone. Vent over./r/"
I know.....,7,mksd1p,1,I know I’m not the most “beautiful” I hate it when people say I am. I know they are lying. Just be honest. I don’t even care about being the best. However it feels like others see that as important. They think I’m being self deprecating.  I’m not. I just feel like I’m being honest with myself. I’m not as smart as I use to be which use to be my redeeming qualifying. I feel like a failure.
I feel like I only exist when I'm seen/heard,3,mkrxqk,0,"This sounds crazy but I've had times where I've believed I've died and I'm just a ghost and like people's interactions only happened if I made an effort to feel seen and it left everyone uncomfortable...like I'm haunting them 

I'm alone a lot. I almost prefer it alone. I don't have an fp but I find myself easily attached to any slither of kindness but otherwise I stay by myself 

Whenever I'm alone...it can feel like I'm not 'real' or I'm not a person or I'm nothing 

When I'm finally seen and recognised by someone I feel real again. Their view of me is alive therefore I am

And when they go I'm gone again. It's like object permanence, once I leave the room or we stop chatting online, I cease living/existing. Just everything about me is gone 

Sometimes someone will say how they thought of me the other day or if someone gets me a present and I'm just like ""wait you had to have thought of me.."" And of course they do, people will think if those around them but it feels like such a mind fuck 

I'm just not really feeling real right now...which I know is crazy but yeah...I don't know"
sorry,1,mkrlic,0,I’m sorry for my last post I really was in a bad place I was just extremely angry. I wanted him to like me so bad I just wanted him to want me. I’m so pathetic I don’t even like this person. I just want to prove to myself that I can do this that I can make him love me. I just want someone anyone to love me. I want to d word. I haven’t eaten in a while I’m crying and angry. All I’ve been doing is obsessively watching plastic surgery and weightloss videos. I can’t do this. I have to do everything in my power to be loved. I don’t even see this person as person anymore but a challenge to be won.
Executive dysfunction,8,mkqdhr,4,"I really need advice on how to handle days like this, where it isnt my depression/anxiety or BPD particularly bothering me, but I cant do literally ANYTHING but i want to soooooo badly!! Like I have 0 other things to do today so realistically I could be using this time to do something like art or learn an instrument or anything at all that would benefit me, the motivation is there like I'd love to be doing it but I just cant.

Please someone tell me they can relate? I've spent hours just sitting here staring at 4 walls just wishing I could do something before the day is done but no such luck. I really relate this to possible undiagnosed ADHD/ADD but I'm not even sure getting a diagnosis would help. Also think it could be that I didn't develop any interests as a child because mentally illness and family shit was going on and I couldn't focus.

Someone please help😭😭😭"
Are people really out there not being suicidal?,147,mkq9h4,46,"TW: suicide(like the title suggests)

Hi... I recently thought about how... are there really people out there that don’t feel like dying every other day? Lmao like... I just realized how this is my normal but.... Doesn’t everyone think about it sometimes? Lollllllll idk what I’m asking but... yikes... ppl are really out there not feeling pain to the point that they would rather die?

I realize this is kind of a silly post but... give me your thoughts haha"
How to stop feeling like I'm unstable/losing my mind constantly?,2,mkq4zy,1,"I constantly feel like I'm on unstable ground or going insane. I left my abusive house and am living with my husband. He doesn't have bpd and I feel guilty but i just feel so unstable. Randomly yesterday I disconnected and attempted to get on a highway by foot. He literally had to grab me and ask if I was seriously gonna do that. I lied obviously but i just want to be a good wife and partner and I don't know how. 

And these thoughts get so bad that sometimes I just want to silence them but obviously I can't because I have him and others I guess. Is there anyway I can improve and feel more stable so I can be a good partner to him? We have no kids. Married for a year. I don't want kids. Not with how I am."
DAE bang their head against a wall when raging?,2,mkq3se,5,"Hi all! I was diagnosed with BPD a few years back. I had a very bad weekend this past weekend and my husband (42M) and I (45F) said and did things we now regret. We almost got to the point of me leaving and talking about divorce, which is bad since I am from the East Coast but my husband and I are living in Cancun, Mexico. We are now working through it but there is that unsettled “weirdness” now. My emotions before my “time of the month” is very emotional and I don’t know how to control it. 

Yesterday, during one of my outbursts (I normally do this when I get really bad), I blacked out and banged my head on the table a few times and have a huge bruise and cut on my forehead. I do it often and somehow I usually bang my head in the same place every time. Does anyone have any coping skills to help me or my husband deal with this so it doesn’t continue? I blackout and don’t know I’m doing it and never remember that I do it until I’m calm again, and it starts to hurt. That’s when my husband tells me what happened. 

I feel terrible for my husband because he says that when I’m about to bang my head, I’m like a robot. I don’t walk right in those moments, I walk like a robot and make sharp turns and go over to something and just bang my head 3 times and then just stand there (a couple times he said I held my head and said “get out of my head” to myself). He’s been researching BPD since we found out my diagnosis and how to help me and also doing a lot of therapy on his own along with marriage counseling together. He has anxiety issues (which was going okay until he met me and has since resurfaced) and PTSD because of my disorder. 

Is there any insight someone could give me as to how to help us or any tips that would help us? I am doing CBT everyday and working my butt off to be a better wife and also a better person in general. I just have a lot of setbacks and it’s very discouraging for me and my husband. He’s an amazing man and I don’t want to lose the love of my life/soulmate. Thank you in advance! Stay safe and strong, my friends!"
Managing FP Feelings,4,mkq329,0,"My favorite person attachments were what first brought me to therapy a few years ago and to me, are the most euphoric and wonderful but also the most distressing part of my BPD. Since starting therapy, I’ve increasingly been able to recognize when someone is starting to become an FP for me and work to use strategies to keep the relationship a close but appropriate and not so obsessive one. My current therapist is my FP and I’ve made a ton of progress with her. I’ve recently been able to, for the first time maybe ever, feel a desire to make friends and find a partner and community and to create intimate relationships beyond my FP (who at this moment, is her). Despite this, and maybe it’s just that I don’t have those relationships yet, I often feel like she is still the only one whose care, reassurance, etc. feels like it can fulfill what I’m seeking. Like if I heard the same words from her vs from a friend the ones from her would be so powerful and the ones from a friend would just fall flat. We’ve talked about how maybe I just need to work on building more intimacy in other relationships, and I think that’s true, but I’m also realizing that in the past, even when I’ve had a strong group of friends and a partner, I have still had FP’s and still craved their care specifically. It makes me feel really frustrated that I could potentially put in all of this work to create lots of other close, intimate relationships in my life but that I still might have an FP who I cling to as an anchor. I guess I’m wondering if anyone has learned how to feel fulfilled through other (non FP) relationships and if anyone had ever managed to get their FP relationships to be mild enough where it’s more manageable and you don’t have those periods of obsessing over them and wishing desperately to contact them all the time etc?"
exhausted...idk...,3,mkpx23,1,"i don’t know how to go on with life, it’s just too hard and i don’t even know why since i don’t really have anything to complain about. but it just hurts so much. i wish i could talk to someone, but there’s noone. i have a lot of good friends, but everytime i open up about my problems i am downplaying how bad it is or how low i feel. like i want and try to show it, but i just can’t and sometimes even laugh it off.
i feel so lonely in an emotional way. i think about quiting life so often, but i am not even able to go that way because i feel too responsible for friends, family or the job i just started. i can’t go on like this neither i want to... but not even ending this all is an option. how do i deal with all this pain (when i don’t even know where it is coming from)? i am so exhausted and i wish for help so bad inside.
(i started therapy last year but then had to quit because of the new job and the work times, had to cancel my psych ward application and stopped my medication because every pill i tried made everything worse.)
i just wish i could go that last one step and get relief of life and it’s pain."
I have a new FP now and he knows about my BPD.,2,mkptdd,0,"This new FP is my childhood friend and I've known him for 12 fucking years. He knows about my disorder and how it's affected me for years and that still affects me every single day. In fact, he even rooted for me the whole time I was got officially diagnosed. 

I've had a long string of Favorite Persons throughout my life and almost every single one of them were people who weren't healthy. If they weren't an alcoholic, broken, or suicidal too, they'd have some other issue. But this FP is a really good guy and he means the world to me. I've loved him even before he was my FP but now I just love him even more. *And I'm terrified.*

It's been really chaotic the last few days and I've been getting worse because of the last FP I lost two months ago (that I had to mourn over *twice*) and my new FP being someone who I really never wanted to be my FP ever. We both agreed on this; as I've explained to him what having an FP felt and looked like and that he's seen my relationships die in a chaotic hurt-filled fury every single time—which is why it distressed me more. 

However! In the midst of the chaos, we talked it out and he told me that we would do our best if he were to ever become my FP. He is officially my FP now. I am still yet to tell him.

So, in essence, I would love to hear all the inputs on trying to keep a relationship because I 've never kept a single one in my life and I don't want him to suffer the same way all the ones before him did. But he's willing to work with me. He's willing to learn and he's never failed at always being very supportive of me. 

I love this man, he's actually healthy and a generally good person. I don't want him to be like everyone else despite my BPD thinking that he still won't be an exception and will leave me too. And I can't imagine living through another devastation that'll be the worst than anything else. 

But I know it's possible. I've seen people have healthy relationships with their FP. It's real even if it feels fucking impossible. I have a therapist, and seeing an LPC on top of that. I might get medicated soon too (yay). And I'm trying really hard but it's *really fucking hard.* I know I say it every time, but I just want things to be different so tremendously terribly. I have so much love for him. If only I could do the same for myself.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I have a new FP who's my childhood friend and I want all the advice for keeping a relationship and advice on how he can be a good FP too. He'll most likely be on this sub soon so we can welcome him hehe. Thank you so much. You guys have all my love<3"
DAE feel undesirable,19,mkpfux,2,"like undesirable in both a romantic and platonic way. that no one would ever consider you in either way because of your bpd? i’ve been feeling this way a lot lately and idk i can’t tell if its my self hatred, the fact that i’m a WOC, or my bpd that causes people to be dissuaded from being around me and loving me"
Can y'all tell me if I jumped the gun?,6,mkpfbv,7,"This probably needs backstop and honestly I need to get it out anyway.
My bf (23M) and I (23F) have been together for 5 years.
Last year around this time my bf and I were going through some shit and almost broke up, I will admit that our major problem was my insecurity and jealousy over a female friend of his. Since then I've been to therapy, gotten resources and have seriously started working on myself. I am basically completely different (I of course still have those jealousy and insecurity but I don't voice it now and I let it pass when it acts up.)
So over the year we've gotten a better. But now that my crap is all sorted I've noticed a lot of issues on his part, issues that I can't overlook. 
Like making excuses when he doesn't want to do something (ex. I have to clean my room, I'm going to br grumpy so I don't want to ruin your night.) His room is filthy and I can't stand being there, so his cleaning excuse is always a complete lie. He lays in bed until 11 am when he's with me and when I try to get him up he snaps at me to just leave him alone. I can go days without a message from him.
I know he's depressed but the way he treats me seems to be unforgivable. It's like I'm just an obstacle in his way, and vice versa.
So, where I ask if I jumped the gun is this- I put our relationship on pause and have decided to take a month apart to see how I feel. If at the end of this month I find he cannot or will not change, I'm breaking it off for good. Is that too far? I would prefer people not to just tell me to end it completely because I won't listen to that and frankly it's.mot constructive. I'm asking if I took an appropriate approach to the situation or if I should've let it carry on because its not even that bad, I love him but I'm starting to love myself to."
I use compassion to regulate my emotions.,79,mkp0un,19,"I realized that the only thing that calms me down when I'm angry is compassion. I need someone to tell me that they understand what I'm going through. That's why I overshare, I just want someone to understand my pain. That's why therapy always frustrates me, I want my therapist to tell me that my pain is valid, not that I have to take responsibility for it, because that doesn't bring me relief. And I'm so tired of not having any other way to regulate my emotions, it's really frustrating, I just want to be able to calm down like a normal person."
how do I get better?,3,mkp04q,1,"I ruined my relationship because my moods flip so much, and he doesn’t know how to handle it anymore. I want to change for the better I want to stop assuming and acting out and being dramatic. I want to change please help me. I want to learn how to control my emotions better."
I feel so socially isolated. I want to see others on here can relate to this,5,mkozl5,7,"I'm a single guy, have no close friends except one that is far away and can only keep in touch over the internet. At times I question whether it is even possible that one day I might not be alone. It's barely possible to keep motivated enough as to be able to work. My BPD has robbed me of life, my dreams, chance of a family of my own. I don't know how long I'd be able to keep going."
"Experiences with guilt, particularly after an episode of splitting or meltdown?",2,mkoxs7,7,"Just wondering how u guys deal with guilt? Guilt is an emotion I feel all the time, excessively and about various things, and often when it isn’t even my fault. I am not sure whether it is actually a BPD thing or more of just a GAD thing, because I have both. 

I’ve been in therapy for a little while now and guilt is one of the main things we go over, and it crops up again and again. I think for me it results from trauma and manipulation, so I feel overly guilty all the time. However, when I have a BPD meltdown and act out I can hurt people. For example, splitting on my boyfriend. I then deal with the guilt from that for so long. Was just wondering if anyone else has this issue, particularly after splitting or a meltdown and how u deal with it."
I fucked up another friendship,1,mkoo47,1,This guy was being really nice to me and I overdid it. He said he'd come pick me up so I wouldnt have to be alone and last night I spammed him with messages. He said to call after a nap so I called 5 times to wake him up. He lives an hour and a half away and I just thought he was so understanding that I would be honest and ask for some help. In reality its complicated but I just went overboard. He hasn't contacted me today and I feel really embarrassed and guilty I put so much pressure on him. I dont think he wants to talk to me again. Sent him a message to apologise and I really just want to know he doesn't hate me but I cant spam without making things worse. I dont know why I keep doing this but I'm so angry at myself. If I had just kept the boundaries I'd worked so hard to build in place this wouldn't have happened. If I hadn't been so desperate for help I wouldn't have relied on someone I barely know
I need advice,1,mkoiqj,2,"Basically, I'm feeling really bad about this and i would love some advice. I have BPD and my best friend does too. In the last 6 months she has made about 6 suicide attempts and everytime i'm the only one she tells about it. So I have had to drive her to the ER, talk with police officers or suicide hotlines and I called 911 twice to save her life. She says she's not angry with me but I hate doing that to her, the hospital only seems to worsen her mood. And I know how it feels to want to die, I feel bad because I'm forcing her to stay alive even if it isnt what she wants. But obviously I can't let her die if she tells me what she's doing.

Since she's been doing this once a month, it keeps me in a really dark mood and I'm trying so hard to stop self-harming (i'm a few months clean now!!) but she keeps telling me about her self harm and suicide ideation and it's so fucking difficult.

My boyfriend and my therapist keep telling me to stop taking care of her and leave it to someone else... I can't do that, i care so much about her and idk if she would tell anyone else if i'm not there during her suicide attempts. Our other friends have a good mental health and they're not confortable talking to her since they dont understand.

Thanks for reading, i would love to hear your opinion on my situation ❤️❤️"
I feel like i’m wasting my life before my eyes,4,mknt2v,11,"It’s been almost 3 years since I started showing severe symptoms, and i guess i thought i would be on the road to recovery by now. I have a strong urge to get better and get my self-confidence back, but the emotional part of me doesn’t want to get better. This disorder forces me to repeatedly do things that make my condition worse. 

but my main point here is that i’m tired of feeling like my life is being wasted. i’m only 20 years old but i feel like i’ll be in the same place until i’m 30. i look back over the last few years and can’t remember many positive experiences. just crying, crying, punching, condemning, hitting, and guilt. that’s my life. your 20s are supposed to be the most fun and exciting time in your life. i have a feeling i’ll look back and say “wow, my 20s sucked and i had no self confidence for years”. i’m ready for fun and adventure. my mind and body feel overdue."
DAE get really overwhelmed with intimacy after a breakup?,16,mknley,15,"I recently was broken up with by my boyfriend of five years; we had future plans and honestly my untreated BPD pushed him away. (We didn’t know I had BPD until last year though). 

I went out on a date last night and it was really fun, the guy was really sweet too. But anytime he tried to like hold my hand or lean in for a kiss I totally freaked out and got extremely uncomfortable. I woke up this morning feeling guilty. I started crying and missing my ex a lot. I just don’t want anyone to touch me but my ex I guess and I’m feeling overwhelmed and frustrated."
I haven’t missed anyone,3,mknesm,1,"Things are recovering from the pandemic since people are being vaccinated. I’m seeing a lot of posts online about how they can’t wait to hug their grandma or see family and friends again. 

I ....dread seeing people again. I have literally no one except my boyfriend. My grandparents are dead and they didn’t really like me much when they were alive. I have a pretty bad relationship with everyone else in my family and haven’t seen any of them in years. We might text once in a while but none of them ever EVER say they miss me or love me. 

I have no friends. I mean, I have some online friends and an old friend I used to hang out with but THINGS happened and our friendship will never be the same. She “checked in” with me online a little while ago and we messaged back and forth, but she promptly stopped responding (you know the old “I’ve been sick but I will reply soon” and then just never replies).

My bf’s family used to get together for everything, AND every month. I used to like it but started to realize they didn’t actually care if I was there or not. And at one point I was told I need to clean the kitchen since I don’t contribute to the meal (this is a whole other can of worms - there’s always a reason when I do something, or not). So it made me feel like scum and basically I am just there to clean up after them. 

I don’t want to go back to doing these things. I feel alone in a room full of people. Nobody talks to me, and no I’m not the outgoing type who can “just talk to them!” I basically shut down in these situations. I don’t even feel like myself. But yeah it’s been over a year and I just dread having to go back to “get-togethers.” Anyone else ??"
This is the worst I have felt in years.,16,mknde0,1,"I cut myself today after 6 years. I was so stressed out, my friends have abandoned me I’m burdening my family and I’m gaining weight. I hate my life. My past and present and whatever its going to be leading to. Kill me now. I don’t want to do this anymore. I’ll never be happy or loved. I’m so tired. My head is going to explode"
I faked a suicide attempt to get sympathy and it didn't work,31,mknbk4,10,"So I've (22F) been living with my aunt and uncle for the past 9 months. The reason for this is because my parents are abusive and I was going insane being quarantined with them so I asked to come here. Little did I know that my uncle would end up being worse in some ways. They're indian immigrants to the US btw so there's some cultural differences. Anyway, my uncle was being extra mean to me for a few days and I got upset so I went to my room and took a bunch of pills. I didn't actually want to die, I knew I would survive, I just thought it would get me some sympathy so he would treat me better. It didn't even work, he's been acting the exact same ever since then and actually said that if I attempted suicide he would let me die. I don't know what to do, being here is awful and I'm not allowed to leave and I actually feel like if im here for too much longer, I'll want to attempt suicide for real."
bpd books for relationships,1,mkn1ug,2,"i’m trying to help my boyfriend understand more about bpd and I find books to be the most beneficial. he has read i hate you don’t leave me, but i’m wondering if anyone can recommend books that are specifically aimed at people with bpd in relationships"
absolute nothingness,6,mkmyx6,1,"all i wish for right now. to make it hurt less and to stop waking up to cry and roll around hoping to turn into dust. 

lots of emotional support have been given during the last few days by close ones and people that know about my situation. it's one of those breakup things you know. it just happened at the worst possible fucking time. 

it was a strange feeling to feel actually good and hopeful of things to come. everything was in shape. then suddenly i lost a huge part of my life and can't stay in this city anymore. it was her decision and i respect it. she was my best friend, my  favorite person, whom i learned so much from. every day is a struggle knowing that she isn't there anymore. 

staying sober is exceptionally hard. yet i know that drinking won't help and no amount of soaking in booze will bring her back. nothing will."
empathy,5,mkmylv,3,"i feel like my concept of empathy is very?? messed up?? i’ve always had a hard time understanding other people’s feelings, since i was a kid (and i used to be pretty violent as a kid) and when i got older and went through therapy it was easier but i’ve just realized i’ve kinda hit a peak?? and i was watching this Bojack Horseman thing and didn’t think i was like him until i realized i’m the same way he is with apologies. i don’t generally feel bad for things i’ve done, and when i do, it’s more like i just want to get rid of the feeling rather than actually make amends. and im realizing that’s what’s ruined a few friendships of mine. if i don’t feel it, how can i fake it? to preserve friendships and to make relationships that i have to deal with easier?"
If my bestfriend texted me saying sorry does she still hate me?,1,mkmlg7,4,"She texted me apologizing saying sorry for hurting you. She split on me at the end on February and I never gave up on her I still text her when I see she’s depressed and stuff on social media. She was suicidal I sent her a long message telling her how much I loved her and that she was really important to me and she immediately texted me back saying thank you and sent me deep music lyrics. It has been low contact since then until she texted me saying ‘sorry for hurting you’ i told her it was okay and I still love her the same I understand her and I won’t give up on her. I just want to know if she felt the need to apologize does she still hate me, does she care about me? I’m her FP and I’m just really confused 🥺"
What am I doing??,27,mkmk76,3,"Does anyone else ever have the feeling that they’re about to colossally fuck things up, but you just keep on going?? About to burn everything to the fucking ground in my life, but it’s like I can’t stop it. These fucking emotions fucking with my head. I know how this attachment shit works by now, but fuck it always happens when I least fucking expect it. Fuck me. I know how unhealthy my attachment issues are but I don’t know how the fuck to fix this shit. I’ve tried to locate DBT help for years. No one in my area offers it and if you have issues other than depression and anxiety, it’s pointless to go because they are zero damn help. Feel so damn lost and like this bullshit will never get better. I’m in my 40’s for fuck‘s sake. I know it’s all my fault. I hate my fucking self and all my bullshit."
I broke up with toxic bf...why am I still hoping he texts or calls?,5,mkma2y,1,"So I broke up with him after 8 months of hell...I'm so friggin proud of myself and I know it was the right thing to do. It's been 2 days now and I haven't reached out, haven't given into the urge to text or into feeling guilty, or the anxiety....I'm trying to distract myself and keep myself busy (thanks DBT)....

But there's this part of me that's hoping he'll call or text, and tell me he realizes he cares, that I 'matter', etc. Why!?!"
I hate how my BPD impacts my fiancé,1,mkm039,4,"I've been through a particularly rough spot over the last few months which led to my diagnosis. I'm swinging so much right now that my partner is having to monitor me and make sure I'm okay. I've been seriously struggling with suicidal ideation and I'm constantly switching between planning to seriously hurt myself and thinking that I can't do that to my partner.

I feel so horrible that he feels that he can't leave the house, has to hide medication/alcohol, and is living with the constant fear that he's going to find me dead.

It makes me feel horribly guilty. It also feeds into the bpd because I'm thinking that he doesn't deserve this and would be better off without me.

I'm trying to make sure he's got support too. But I don't know how much longer I can do this to him for."
"I have decided that I will not share about BPD, other mental health issues, etc. with new people anymore",20,mklsqk,5,"People who have known me for a long time can already guess. Maybe it were the memes i shared as a teenager, or just how open and frank and loud i was. I had no shame because i knew it isn't my fault. Overall, it felt great to share.

But i am not a teenager anymore. I have entered my 20s and along the way, i have had many experiences which have taught me to have stronger boundaries and \*not\* talk about mental illness much. sure a meme about depression here and there won't hurt, tho it might if you are employed. but otheriwse, leave it to the anonymous awareness raising instagram accounts.

An abusive POS dated me and found me appealing, and my BPD had a huge role to play in it. He thought 'troubled women' are sexy. I used to self harm regularly back then, had terrible self esteem, was suicidal. He loved it. He even asked me to send photographs of my scars.

I have been called mentally ill and sick during arguments. My BPD has become a point for hurtful personal attacks. Hell, even on Reddit, when i argued with a man for saying women deserve to be raped for the way they dress, he came back at me and called me insane, crazy, sick, that i deserved everything that happened to me, that BPD women should be 'used for sex and discarded'. It was very, very hurtful. Ofc the memory doesn't hurt me anymore but it stung for a v long time.

I used to be open about it on dating apps ( i don't use them anymore and i love it) because I believed everyone deserves to know about it before we proceed further. Almost all ignore anyway. And others think it makes me an interesting person. Awareness about BPD in my country is extremely low.

Not to forget how my exes brought it up whenever i got mad at them for very valid reasons. I can see it all clearly in hindsight now, but back then i couldn't.

I have been quarantined for a year,and single too. God i love being single. I really can't imagine being treated nicely, being loved anymore. I used to dream of a happy ending but i have lost my faith. It was a huge fucking deal for someone like me, it's like i did a 180. Anyway, that's not the point.

The point is, whenever i have been honest, it backfired. People use it to personally attack me, invalidate it and say it's no big deal (THIS is the worst i swear, i don't share because i am not ready to be told how it's not that bad), fetishize it. Overall, they don't undertsand, and make no attempts to.

Hence, I have decided to not share. Anonymous spaces like these are alright, but not outside. Not even memes and jokes about 'lighter' topics like low self esteem. People prey on you when you do that. I worry it might be unethical? But honestly, i choose my protection over ethics. If they make efforts to really know and love me, then yes. Otherwise, no. I pretend to be stoic and healthy. I come off as secretive and weird but that's better than being perceived as 'troubled'.

what do y'all think? do you share your struggles?"
Feelings for someone I literally saw one time,3,mklomj,1,Last night I hung out with an old friend of mine from middle school. We used to be inseparable and then we mutually grew apart as our interests differed as we got a bit older. We’re both in our 20’s now and both suffer from BPD. Last night we hung out and rly hit it off and I think I have a crush on her which can’t happen for multiple reasons. Why do our brains do this? Why am I fantasizing about a relationship & future with this girl lol
im at my breaking point. please help.,2,mklnbn,0,"after a very hard 2 and a half year relationship with my bf, who has never been ready to be in a relationship but forced himself to be with me because of how much he loved me, we have decided to just be friends indefinitely. i knew this was coming, it’s been a long time coming, but it hurts. i can’t imagine myself with anyone other than him, and i know he feels the same. he has a lot going on mentally that he’s unable to get help for right now and because of that he feels like he can’t be in a relationship. it has nothing to do with me or how much he loves me, because he really does love me and said he’s never going to get over me and if it was up to him we’d be ok and happy right now, but he can’t mentally handle it. he’s my soulmate and he’s absolutely everything to me. i know a lot of people go through stuff like this and eventually end up together years down the line but not being with him feels so wrong to me and on top of this, i’m moving out in august to go to college and so is he and we’re potentially going to be 4 hours away from each other and my parents are moving out of my childhood home and going to basically the middle of nowhere, so between me and him and all the changes happening in my life i feel like im suffocating. all i want is to be with him and be happy but right now that’s not an option, it could be months from now but i don’t know how to be patient and the thought of not being with him makes me feel physically sick and i don’t know what to do. i don’t think i’ll be ok until me and him are back together and happy. we’ve been better than we have in awhile since just being friends, we’re texting all day every day again which we haven’t done in a long time and i know it took a lot of stress off of him so i feel bad for even complaining, but i know i’ll never be happy unless we get back together. i know there’s a good chance of that happening but it’s gonna take awhile. i have such an extreme amount of anxiety and i just want him, and on top of this, im also dealing with 2 diagnosed anxiety disorders, depression, borderline personality disorder, and a possible eating disorder. he’s the only thing that made any of those better. please help. i feel like im at my breaking point."
i hate my fp,19,mkl5cj,3,"i didn’t want to care for you. i tried to be distant when we became friends so i wouldn’t get attached. you were stupid enough to think you wanted me in your life and i hate you for it now. i hate that you have moved on and i’m still stuck here pretending i’m not in love with you. 
i hate that you can tell i still care for you more than i should. you probably think i’m pathetic. this is your fault. i never fucking wanted this. 
i wish i could just cut you out of my life right now but i’m selfish and i don’t know how to exist without you. you know i’d forgive you for anything. 
i wish you were an awful person so it would be easier for me to convince myself i need to let go of you. i wish you would tell me to fuck off so i could have an excuse to tell you that you’re just as pathetic as i am."
I think I’m a masochist,5,mkkot5,2,I think masochism and bpd can go hand in hand sometimes. It’s almost like I get a kick out of driving the knife in my pain and other peoples but of course I don’t actually. It’s like my self-hatred is brought up in my subconscious and leaks out wether I like it or not.
Intrusive thoughts are suffocating.,3,mkkl14,3,"Early today I was playing dead by daylight with my friends. It was just us 4 and one of them said something to do with me and my boyfriend. I can't remember what exactly but it seemed to be hinting at us not being close anymore or into eachother anymore. 

(For context - me and my bf have had opposite sleep schedules for a while now, so most of the time I'm asleep during the day, while he's asleep during the night. We admittedly haven't spent much time together. My previous job was the reason but I recently got fired from it. Another note is we both have the same friend group.)

When I first heard it I tried to ignore it. I did for a little but then it started to pick away at me. ""What if they're right?"", ""What if he stopped liking me?"", ""What if he leaves me?"". I quickly tried to distract myself so that my thoughts don't get worse, but it still would randomly cram itself into my mind here and there. I eventually got tired and went to have a shower before bed, but that feels like the worst thing I could of done. 

In the shower my thought immediately start flooding. ""He's going to leave me"", ""he hates me"", ""I've done nothing with my life so we wouldn't be able to have a future together"", ""we won't work out because I'm useless"", ""I'm a failure and he knows it"", ""he's just pitying me and doesn't know how to leave me"". It just kept spiraling. I started thinking about us being moved in together and me continuesly being fired from jobs (I've been fired from 2 recently) and me just bothering him with my mental problems or him just being annoyed with me. Then I imagined the thought of him giving up on me and telling me to move out. Me packing my bags and finding somewhere to end my life. At this point I'm crying in the shower over something that hasn't happened, and I didn't realise it until I snapped out of my thought. All the emotions from these thoughts just ache and are so prominent that I can barely function.

I don't know how to handle these scenarios that run though my head. I feel like I'm living in them and that they're real and very much happening. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone about it because I complain too much already about things that upset me or paranoia I get. I don't want to drive people away with my emotional unhinged states. I know people get sick of me venting to them but at the same time I need help and support. Is that manipulative of me? I don't know what to think anymore. I don't want to feel this way, I don't want to think this way, I hate how my mood can be fine then shifts into despair in a single trigger.

I feel really hopeless and that there's no way to help me."
If I’m not the actions I regret then what am I,4,mkki4k,0,"It’s like I always ignore the voice in my head that I should be listening to. I am trying to be more aware and listen to it but I still ignore it 85% of the time. I say or do stupid things and am fully aware that I shouldn’t say the stupid thing but it’s really hard not to. I end up ruminating and beating myself up over these mistakes and I feel like if people knew how I actually felt they wouldn’t hate me as much. I guess my question is am I the asshole things I say if I feel like they aren’t a representation of me or are they who I am and I’m just in denial about what a jerk I am. 

I hate myself so much and I always justify my actions by thinking “I hate me more than anyone else” but this way of thinking isn’t solving any of my problems."
Does anybody feel hurt when their friends find partners?,25,mkkgkt,6,"
I want to be happy for them and i love that they found love but i feel so betrayed and left. I feel like if they found someone so close to them, they won't care about me anymore.

I'm so scared, because I'm always the omega on everybody's list. I'm never anybody's priority and like, that ok because I'm awful but it still hurts when their list of priorities gets longer and it pushes you even further down.

Sometimes (i fucking hate myself for this) if i have a close (especially male)  friend and we talk about everything and because of the understanding and support i try to give them, they open up to me, and then after time, they find a partner i get SO angry. i would never tell them but it feels like as if I'm their therapist and when i ""help"" them, they move on to something better and don't want to be friends with me. like I'm not even a person to them"
Dumbed down,1,mkkg83,1,"Ive been on proper treatment - taking my meds as prescribed - for 9 months now after defaulting many many times. I was on and off meds prior to an intervention. 

Does anyone else feel like they have lost their intellect due to meds? I used to be sharp, articulate, outgoing and everything but now ive become timid, afraid, shy and,,, slow? Its like a numb effect. Is it the drug abuse? Or the years of mental anguish growing up which spiralled into my relationships? Could it be the abuse im facing from my partner that ive become a timid little fuck? Could it just be the effects of the medication (im on mood stabiliser and antipsychotic and xan)? 

Ive lost friends over the course of my treatment cause i started being a fucking weirdo. Social cues are off. I learned that i tend to stare at people. I’m on my first job after having graduated with a first class honours degree but i can swear my colleagues look at me like there is something very wrong with me.

I really want to know. It’s really hard to not give up."
"I’m definitely the asshole in this, yet I’m triggered and excessively angry",1,mkkfo4,4,"I’ve been with my bf for nearly two years and we’ve always been good together. He’s kind and supportive and handles my issues pretty well. 
About a month ago I started talking to someone on Reddit and we still talk. I didn’t tell my bf until a few days ago. He didn’t like it but I assured him we were just friends and he’s okay with it. 
Now today I’ve woken up in the most horrible mood and when I was finally coming back from it again I noticed he was adding a coworkers number in his phone. He was struggling a bit with shortcuts so I helped him to open WhatsApp so he could send a message. As soon as I walked away though a very intense anger came over me and haven’t been able to let it go. My ex before him used to sext with random people and hide it and deny it and so this just triggered me massively. 
I feel like it’s completely unfair for me to be angry or hurt right now as he’s just talking to a coworker and he wasn’t even trying to hide it. Besides, I was talking to someone online and I didn’t tell him for a few weeks. I’m not really a jealous person usually (he sometimes talks about people at work flirting and that doesn’t do anything for me) but this just set me off. 
If I don’t try my hardest to shut up right now I’m just gonna blurt out something like ‘just go to her then and never come back’. 
I don’t know what to do and I can’t shed this anger. Help."
Sex life and promiscuity as a coping mechanism,4,mkkf02,3,"Im a man in my 30s now and i have always been very promiscuous with other men ever since i can reach my memory. I started having an active sex life at some point between the age of 14 and 15. I was always mainly doing short term relationships that as u may guess have always been very intense and dramatic. At the age of about 19 i stopped counting the men i was sleeping with as i reached a 300 and decided no point keeping check of that. 
6 years ago i met my current husband. Im not gonna get into why and how but all im gonna say we are soulmates on a soul level but we do not have any form of sex. We just dont. 
My symptoms ever since have gone up big time, as i no longer can practice my usual “coping mechanism” which is sleeping around. As a matter of fact it wasnt even the sole sleeping around that was my thing, it was more of a fact that it was a NEW guy. I hardly ever did the same guy more than twice. Again, it wasnt sex that got me hooked up, it was the NEW MAN card that kept my engine going. 
Anyway long story short i have always been faithful in all my short term relationships and so i am in this long term one. 
Circling back to my earlier point, being in this monogamous relationship deprived me of my main and favorite coping mechanism. 
So i started overspending. Like hugely. 
But thats not what i wanna talk about. 
Tell me how long can one go without sex (6 years for me now) and how scared would u be u eventually would cheat?"
not always bpd's fault,275,mkkedo,42,"I've spent a long time blaming my bpd for my behavior and for my life being as shitty as I think it is. I've blamed it for the partners I've lost and the opportunities I've missed but I think I'm finally coming to the realization that it's not always BPD's fault. 

It's so nice to have a scapegoat like an already known and demonized mental illness, but I need to take responsibility for my actions. I have not always been a good person and for as long as I am human I will always make mistakes and question the validity of my goodness. BPD sucks, but it's an obstacle and I can't keep saying ""my BPD made me do this"" because no it didn't. I've told myself that narrative so many times that I stopped taking accountability for myself and stopped trying to change. That's unfair to me, unfair to the people I keep in my life, and unfair to other people with BPD. Going to a NT person with no experience in dealing with BPD and saying ""sorry lol my BPD made me do it"" will just harm them and create a bad image of what BPD is to them. 

It's not always BPD's fault because life is simply not sunshine and rainbows. There will always be some type of stressor around the corner that triggers me into an episode, that's something no one can control. And God I am so tired of the same routine of me having some sort of selfish emotional breakdown and then telling myself ""haha just BPD things! :)"".

Edit;; just wanted to add an edit cause I didn't expect anyone to read this haha! 
Thank you for the rewards and the nice comments I've read and also for other peoples insight

I wanted to clarify that when I posted this, I was speaking on how I would use my BPD to excuse my terrible behavior rather than acknowledge that my BPD might have been just a factor. I stopped apologizing for hurting people. I stopped critically thinking about why what I was doing was wrong. It was easier to use the excuse that I'm mentally ill than it was to keep constantly fighting a battle where I feel like it's me against myself and the world at large. When I say that it's not always BPD's fault, it's because it's not. I am responsible for the damage I do and I cannot blame my BPD for that when I am capable of growth and change. I am not a helpless victim to BPD because I can fight back against it by continuing to work on myself."
My family have given up on me,1,mkjo99,1,After another suicide attempt on Friday my family have decided they want nothing to do with me n haven't spoken to me since its only been 3 days but im so hurt they have left me on my own battling this awful illness with no help or support so now im feeling more suicidal than I was before...don't think I entirely knew the ripple effect my illness has on those around me thats prob why I'm on my own with no one now
DAE not split on the toxic people,1,mkjmph,7,"I’m not sure if this is how it is for the majority but I’ve been really struggling in a toxic relationship for about 7 months on and off, but like usually in a relationship I spilt after a month on someone as soon as any bad signs come up and I’m like over them instantly (which is bad I know) but as soon as I enter a relationship where I should probably get out, I just don’t. I continue to give everything and more and just never see the bad and switch up on them. I just end up more obsessed and hurt. 

I just wanna know if this is like something that PwBPD struggle with too or if it’s just something I’ve done to myself haha"
No good morning text,1,mkjk1i,2,"My girlfriend didn’t send a good morning text today and I saw that she was on Reddit. I’m thinking in my head that I’m not priority for her and that Reddit and the people she knows on there is more important than me.

Is this splitting or a BPD thing?

Edit: I’m actually just realizing that I might have BPD. It helped because before knowing about BPD , I would have texted her “it’s nice how your Reddit friends got a good morning, guess they’re more important than me, thanks a lot”"
question about hypnotherapy,0,mkimes,2,"i’ve just booked in hypnotherapy for next week to help with my ptsd traumas and i feel like i should also ask for help w some bpd behaviours.. have any of
you done hypnotherapy before and did you benefit? :)"
I feel like a fucking parasite.,90,mkifpb,8,"I’ve just started becoming close with someone new, I literally can’t stop thinking about them. I crave their attention, every little piece of it I get just feeds my illusion of what we will be in the future. I forget to brush my teeth, I don’t reply to anyone, I forget to eat, I forget to sleep. All my time and effort is being put into this new person, I can’t remember to do anything because there’s only one thing I’m focused on. I mean, a million things I’m focused on, but just around that one person. I just can’t believe how much we have in common, we are basically the same person. 

Oh right, I know they like that so my brain has chosen to focus on that so they like me more. Suddenly I have all these reasons of my I’m messaging them, hey they didn’t reply, don’t message them...okay I’ve messaged them again. But “hahaha I’m sorry if I’m annoying you!” No, I’m not annoying them, they like the attention. Until they realise I’ve implemented myself so deep into their life and they think they need me when all I needed was them. Until that gets boring, because we aren’t the same person. 

I am a million different people, and none at all."
I’m having trouble in my relationship.,4,mkidz1,0,I’m having trouble telling my s/o on how to better handle me when I’m in crisis mode and just a better way to respond and handle me in the first place and I feel like he’s not really making an effort but I also feel like I’m being too demanding of him like by asking him to be nicer about asking me of things even when he’s frustrated or just responding to me different because it makes me insecure the way he responds to me.
Being open about your mental illness is a bad idea?,17,mkhnjf,14,"hey folks,

I'm 21 with bpd.

I'm not sure how stuff works in the ""progressive West"", but in Eastern-Europe mentally ill people are still heavily stigmatized (especially if you live in the even less progressive country and not in a big city).

I have my diagnosis since I was 18 and I started taking meds around that time too (still on them). even tho I'm trying to be a real person and not just a bunch of symptoms, there are still times in life when someone asks you a question or you talk about something with someone and your honest answer/response would be ""yeah I couldn't make it, I was hospitalized because I wanted to die that time"" but instead I just say some bullsh- like ""oh I don't really remember"" or something like that. and I always feel bad because I'm lying and because I'm ashamed of myself.

I mean it's not like a huge problem but tbh after years it's really-REALLY tiring and awkward. even in my family it's like a taboo or something, my close family members know about the issues I had but that's all. I mean I don't want to talk about it all the time or anything like that, but I just don't want to lie all the time or act like my mental problems are non existent.

and when I think about my future, I can't really imagine that this problem will solve itself. moreover, getting older and getting to know more and more people just forces me to lie more over time.

people talk about their (and even their family members', friends'!!) health issues like it's a daily thing, but whenever mental health, suicide, depression comes up, it's just... awkward silence.

my question is... do you think being honest about these things could make me end up in a bad place? I don't want to brag about it, I don't want to talk about it all the time, I just want to answer questions honestly and not make up stories..."
"Are there any books that explain ""quiet"" borderline?",61,mkhlg4,7,"Hi!

Using People For Dopamine,5,mkhgiu,0,"I kind of feel like I should feel like an asshole. I've been seeing someone for some months now, beginning as fuck buddies but now they've caught at least a few feelings. We haven't talked about it, though they occasionally say they like me or whatever, but also qualify that they don't mean it super seriously (I'm paraphrasing, a bit).

I feel nothing. I don't frequently feel anything outside of obsession or disdain for people and I feel neither for them. I'm more depressed than normal, so I'm closer to disdain most days. But I do get dopamine when we have sex and occasionally when we cuddle.

It's nice, having someone around at times. I would never make myself vulnerable to them or confide in them, though, so it simultaneously is just as frustrating as everyone else I interact with. Minus the good moments, I spend a lot of the time with them feeling tired and like I don't want to exist."
Fml,6,mkgz8s,5,"Im a nursing student, left-handed, and i have an exam in 30 min and my friend insisted on practicing on me and i didn’t know how to lie on the spot. She wanted to try an exam that involved measuring my pulse on my right arm and i asked her to do it in my left arm and she said she wanted to practice it on my right since that’s how we’ll do it on the patient and i freaked out and it was so obvious and in the end i asked her to try it with my sleeve not rolled up and it showed that she realized why i didn’t want her to. 

This happened in front of another friend that’s known for having a big mouth so now im in the bathroom having a panic attack because i feel like now everyone will know about my SH and i cant breathe. I’ve been able to hide it for 8-9 years why Now is it biting me in the ass i cant breathe i don’t live somewhere that is understanding of mental illness when my sister saw an old scar a while ago i asked her to gtfo of my room and she said “why, you wouldnt have done it if you didnt want people to see” and this is the only thing playing in my head right now idk how i am going into the exam"

I lost my FP - Cant stop crying.,4,mkgm9p,3,"Hey guys, I lost my FP 2 days ago whom I have known over a year and have been close with since 5 months. 
We got to know each other over the internet and we spend every day together. Talking, face caming,, gaming, watching videos and so on. We even planned on seeing each other irl soon. Now..he is gone. He does not want to cope with me anymore. I knew that I haf BPD traits and already lost people because of it. 
That is why I warned him beforehand and told him my triggers and that it would be best to always communicate if there was something wrong. Thats the healthier way is it not?  Since I told him that he read stuff about BPD in the internet..how they should keep their distance from us and what sick monsters we are. This hurt me so much hearing that from him.
We had really good times and he became my FP really fast. I would go as far as saying that I caught feelings for him. I never wished him bad or anything. 
Now he pointed put angrily how high maintenance I am..how demanding and attention seeking. 
He said he understands why people start to ignore me at some point. That broke my heart really.
I mean..thinking about it from his point of view..and the fact that he wasnt as invested in me than I was in him..I can understand it. I do..and I hate myself again. Because this cycle keeps repeating and I never seem to learn.
He means so much to me and losing him so sudden makes my heart explode. I cant stop crying and I wished I could turn back time. Im so helpless because even explaining why I behaved the way I did didnt help. I told him..that if he was happier without me I would stay away. 
Im devastated..I feel so unworthy of love and life.
I feel like I am a burden to everyone and that I am a mistake.
I really miss him and cant understand that I am so meaningless to him that he wouldnt sit down with me and talk it out. 
What can I do to make it hurt less? I already apologized to him. I just wish he would tell me that he still likes me."
Try at every moment to run away from a relationship,3,mkgdt0,5,"I have what some would describe as a very good “relationship”, and I use quotations because I in a way, refuse to be in a relationship with my S/O, however he does treat me the way that I think many people wish to be treated in a relationship. He is kind, caring, understanding, and loving, but in my mind I find him incredibly irritating... And he is quite the opposite of irritating. We are long distance and with that comes with the need to be patient and sometimes in the dark because we obviously can’t check on each other the way we normally could in person. This factor drives me completely insane. I know this is my illness doing the driving when I become this way but it’s as if I want him all the time, but when he’s finally free and able to spend time with me I become vile and incredibly hard to be around. It’s at these moments the autopilot takes over and I pick fights over things that have happened years ago, I become aggressive with things he doesn’t do such as replying faster, not paying attention to me in a conversation, etc... And then at the end of it all we end up canceling the movie night, and he ends up going to sleep and I end up being angry and holding on to that anger until I feel okay again (which varies day by day!) At many times throughout the years I have tried to get him to admit that he would be better off without me, and when he disagrees or doesn’t want to speak about it I again, go off on my temper tantrums. I know I am very toxic, and I’m trying to pinpoint my triggers but it’s a struggle and a battle every day with my mind. Im just wondering if it’s just me with this sort of issue... I’m feeling at a loss."
how the hell do you handle living on your own?,7,mkgcfd,0,"23F with BPD, suspected ADHD, anxiety and depression over here 🙋🏻‍♀️

as time goes on I’m slowly realising I suck at being on my own. I can’t handle my own company. my thoughts run rampant when I’m alone. 

I was with my ex boyfriend from the age of 15 to 21. he was emotionally abusive, manipulative and cheated on me 3 years into our relationship. I stayed with him and for 2.5 years I pretty much hated him and felt single but was too scared to leave. when I was 19 during that time I was kicked out of my mum’s house and moved in with my grandparents for two years. I broke up with my ex and I was living on my own for about a year between 21-22. I had started talking to my new boyfriend right after the breakup with my ex because it felt like I was emotionally done with my previous relationship for so long that I felt I didn’t need time to heal. he just walked in to my life at a time that I needed a positive influence, and he was/is amazing. 

I then moved in with my boyfriend of 8 months at the time (and his family) because I hated living on my own, was mostly at his place anyway and our relationship was in a great place. 

fast forward to now just over a year later and his mum kicked me out for the frequent arguments my bf and I were having, plus she was getting involved in our relationship. we are still together but I am staying with my grandparents feeling like I don’t have a fucking home and feel more mentally ill than ever. I’m currently looking for a rental, and my boyfriend has some hesitations about signing a lease together right now because we have been arguing for literally 6 months now - so I don’t blame him. he wants to see how our relationship goes with a bit of breathing space and hopefully we rekindle and he is confident enough to move out with me in the near future. I love him dearly and want our relationship to work, and would rather have him in my life than not at all. 

I feel like I genuinely despise being alone. right now it feels like I’m homeless with just an empty house to stay in temporarily, my grandparents are never here and will be selling this home in 2-3 months. finding a rental is hard. I know I’ll feel better when I have somewhere to call “home”, but even then I have my reservations that I’ll still hate it. what do I do? how do I learn to love my own company? how do I not put a bunch of expectations on my partner to be with me 24/7? I need help. I go to therapy and I’m medicated but it doesn’t feel like enough."
Spouse,2,mkfzbb,8,"Sitting here in my bed on my 42nd birthday. Laying next to me is my wife of 15 years and the mother of my 2 children.
She was recently diagnosed with BPD and Bi Polar disorder.
For the past 15 years I have always been the empath and have always stuck by her side even though I knew she had Bi Polar about 5 years ago long before her recent diagnosis.
We have been fighting super bad since covid hit. So for the past year it has been a non stop fight. So after the last big manic episode she had, she told me she is moving to Las Vegas, she quit her job abruptly, ripped everything off the walls in the home that she purchased, jammed it all into a spare bedroom, and then finally took it all to a storage unit.
Well after about a week, she realized what she would be walking away from and  began back pedaling, asked me if she could stay. I love her with all my heart, but I told her NO.
That she opened up the flood gates and now has to live with her actions. Part of me want her to stay, and be her hero, her superman, the guy who has always been there for her. But other part of me says fuck it. Let her go and be free.
I fear for her safety, moving to Las Vegas all alone. We have been talking and she has been super hyper sexual. I guess we are not getting divorced, but separating for now and taking a break. I have a feeling she wants to sleep with other people during our break. It breaks my heart thinking about that happening. I know woman with BPD can be rather promiscuous, she swears she has not been with anyone since with got back together years ago. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation and had it work out? I want to think positively about the situation, but my anxiety and depression are getting the best of me. The more I learn about her diagnosis, the more I realize I suffer from many symptoms that spouses of  people who have BPD Deal with.
PTSD, from her yelling and screaming at me, throwing knives and causing me harm. Anxiety from feeling like I'm constantly walking on eggshells. Depression and feelings of worthlessness because anything I ever do for her is never good enough. Anyways dont even know why I'm sitting here awake on my birthday typing this out. But  just felt the need to vent about my situation and see if anyone out there can relate."
My FP and I confessed we have feelings for each other after a long time. But he has revealed that he has feelings for someone else too and I feel BROKEN.,7,mkfo08,1,"cw // self harm, suicidal thoughts

this is heartbreaking. my fp admitted he has feelings for me and he always has, but while trying to get over me, he started liking someone else. and he still has feelings for this person. he still likes me as well. 

i don’t have feelings for anyone else.

i feel so broken.

the past few days we were flirting with each other and i felt so secure and happy about our relationship, I NEVER FELT SO STABLE BEFORE. and now? it’s all fallen apart. i love him the most as a friend of course, but this is so painful i literally feel like dying and i hate myself for it. 

i have really important final exams coming up, but i can’t focus on anything, THIS IS ALL I AM THINKING ABOUT CONSTANTLY. i feel dead inside. i want to self harm. i want to do something. 

man i hit my head against a wall until it started bleeding because i just wanted to feel something else other than this heartbreak. i’m so exhausted. things never work out. and i can’t help but feel like its all my fault. i am the problem. maybe i am the terrible person and that’s why things never work out for me.

he said he’ll think about whether or not he can have a relationship with me and i said the same thing.. but is that even fair? if he has feelings for someone else, is it fair to me to be in a relationship with him? i know i should have some self respect and say if he has feelings for someone else, he shouldn’t be with me. but i can’t help myself. i almost don’t care. i just want to be with him. 

in the end i think the best thing to do is sort this out after our final exams but this is consuming me so much. i don’t know how to pull myself together."
Wish I had someone who loved me,21,mkfdzz,5,"I know a relationship won’t solve my mental illnesses and issues, but I wish I had someone who loved me.

Psychedelics while boderline ?,7,mkefk2,14,"Has anyone here tried psychedelics , and if so what were they and how do you feel ? I watched a video recently and the person was saying never to do psychedelics with someone who’s bpd I guess because they were having a bad trip . I’m just curious because they always make it seem like everyone with a diagnosis is insane and we lack the ability to have profound spiritual experiences. 

Disclaimer: they say people with bpd shouldn’t do psychs . but I think spiritually it can be a special trait and our western medicine just wants to point fingers at the people who are wired differently , and say something is wrong with people who think differently. 
I’m not encouraging anyone to try psychedelics but I just want to hear others experiences first hand . Rather then some jerk on YouTube . Lol 
And I’m aware of the warnings to stay away from it but I’ve done a lot of work , therapy , mediations etc along this journey into psychedelics.  

If anyone is curious about my specific experiences I’ll share soon maybe ."
I like disassociating,43,mkec5h,5,"It’s the only time I feel true peace and I don’t have to experience being me. I purposefully disassociate and I smoke lots of weed too so that doesn’t help. Sometimes I go so deep into an episode that my eyes will be completely open but everything around me is blank and my whole body is numb, like i’m turning into my surroundings and i’m not in my body. When this happens it feels like i’m stuck and can’t move. It happens anytime i’m not stimulated. Mainly in showers but it could be anywhere ESPECIALLY if I have a stressful thought about an fp or something. I can see why people would find it scary but is it normal to enjoy it?"
How do I (19F) live with being cheated on repeatedly by someone (20M) I cannot bring myself to leave?,1,mke0bx,2,"Please, please, please read. I need help with this and I promise it will be somewhat interesting.

As pretty much everyone with BPD knows, relationships are undoubtedly the main source of happiness and the main source of pain in our worlds, no matter how much we wish they weren’t. So this is of course; my entire world right now.

I will try to keep this as short as I can while still providing enough detail to understand the situation. I met (we will call him Chase) in late 2019 off of a dating app, and within 10 minutes of hanging out we had a connection and a chemistry that could not be ignored. We were both very unstable and rushed into a relationship that lasted about 2 months, until a specific time that he broke up with me and didn’t call me back 5 min later, as he usually did. That was in February 2020, and from that point until August (about 7 months) it was about as toxic as it gets. He preyed on every last vulnerability I had as a borderline - blocking and leaving me for 2 weeks, coming back in and saying all the right things for about a week, verbally attacking me telling me I’m weak and essentially worthless and manipulating me into apologizing to HIM for god only knows what, and repeating all of these things, over and over and over and over and over. I was exhausted. Suicidal every minute of every day - except for when he was giving me attention, which was rare. He would swoop back in, come over, laugh with me for hours like we were best friends, fuck me 4 times in one night, and then not even seem to know I existed the next day. He had his own issues and the amount of times I had to talk him down from suicide was unbelievable. What made it unbelievable is what it looked like in comparison to the amount of times I tried to cry on his shoulder or confide in him when I was on the sheer edge of suicide, and he would say something like “I don’t have time for this shit” and block my number for a week. 

It. Was. Awful. I am sparing many details as to keep this shorter but in short, it was a borderline’s worst nightmare. I did attempt suicide during this time and I’m actually proud of myself for only attempting once, seeing as I had a debilitating panic attack around once a day. I couldn’t bare it. But I couldn’t fucking pull myself out. I was also an alcoholic, which made me much more susceptible to his abuse. 

In early July 2020 I came to a breaking point one night, and I just somehow knew, I knew if I was going to survive I had to do 2 things: put down the bottle and leave. Looking back, leaving was easier because he had me blocked and had already left me (I knew he’d always come back, but I needed to not let him.) So I did it. I remember the day. July 7th, I threw away what was left of my alcohol, and just began living a Chase-free life. I really did so fucking well. I think I could’ve even walked away forever. He had hurt me bad enough at this point that’s the thought of him genuinely made me want to vomit, and I somehow made my brain stick with that instead of romanticizing him. Being sober was also necessary in this process. I swear, I had more control over myself and my life in the month of July 2020 than I ever have, and fear I ever will have again. 

Sometime in early August he came back again. I had done so well, ignoring his calls messages but on this particular night I convinced myself that there was nothing wrong with checking in and asking if he was ok. He could 100% sense that I was somewhat moving on, and that he had almost no control of me at all. It was so obvious how much that drove him crazy. Him and I always had a deep, deep connection, but I was unbelievably clingy and suffocating up to this point, so he didn’t feel the need to appreciate our connection as something he could lose until now. So of course, he begged and he pleaded, and he cried until he sobbed until he threw up, not giving up until I told him I would give him another chance. I couldn’t quite say no to him. I had come so far to a point where I could essentially live without him, but saying no to him was not a strength that I had. So what I did say what is that if he could keep this act up for a month, this act of wanting to actually be with me, to really, really be with me, I might give him a chance. And that’s exactly what he did. Only it wasn’t an act. Everything changed in August. It was as if I was no one before, and suddenly he was in love with me. And it’s been that way ever since. He could not possibly bring himself to leave me now. 

We were still very toxic, but we became so close, no one could tear us apart. We were a literal team. He became part of my family, coming to Thanksgiving and Christmas, and anywhere else I went with me. We were (and are) so codependent on each other that it worked, bc we just fed each other’s codependency. He dedicated all his time to basically overcompensating for the pain he put me through for so long. I resented him so much, and we fought about it all the time, but it did give me some power in the way that no matter what, he always felt like he owed me. I never do the dishes anymore, take out the trash, or go a night without getting a back scratch. I’ve got to admit it was pretty nice. Especially considering the fact that I have been in love with him for so long and this is all I had dreamed of, never actually believing it would become a reality. It’s as if somebody dropped $1 million in a homeless man’s lap. You constantly ache for it, but you have the sense to know it will never happen. But it did for me.

All of this was ripped apart two weeks ago. I won’t get into all the gory details, but on March 20th, he accidentally fucked up and basically outed himself. It wasn’t necessarily proof that he was cheating, but it was proof that he was hiding something from only me on his phone. I knew in that moment he was cheating, and I shut down. I would not speak to him. This always drives him insane. He cries and cries and panics and begs and says anything and talks himself into corners until I give in and speak to him again. This time the only words I could muster were, “the only way you’re going to fix this is if you unlock your phone and hand it to me”. This is not something I ever wanted to do. I have avoided it at all fucking costs. He was always so secretive with this phone, and I denied in my head that he could be cheating because it would be too much to handle. I assumed that he just watched a fuck ton of porn or something, and didn’t want me seeing anything like that in his phone, which would have made me uncomfortable but I would’ve been fine, so I was okay believing that that’s what I was in denial of. 

Okay so I am trying not to drag this on. Let me just give the major details of what has gone on in these past two weeks. I saw on his phone that he was messaging hundreds of women (or at LEAST 100), from women he had already messed around with, to women he messaged on Instagram, to women he met on dating apps, to women he worked with, and there was literally no end to it. He flirted with anything that had a vagina and a pulse. I don’t even fucking understand how he found the time to do it. It had to be literally all he was doing every time he or I went to the bathroom, every time he laid awake next to me while I slept, every time I went to work (only 20hrs a week) and the very few times that he ever went home or went and hung out with his friend. We spent every moment together. He did none of this right next to me. Most of what he did was sexting and essentially begging for nudes. I know for a fact he begged one girl to fuck and flirted relentlessly with her for months until she felt bad for me and stopped answering, starting in AUGUST, the month he pledged his love to me and basically said he would slit his own wrists before ever causing me any pain again. Getting on his hands and knees to let me let him prove to me that he could be good to me, and make up for everything that caused me to resent him from the past, telling me he would do everything in his power for the rest of his life if that’s what it took. Meanwhile, CHEATING AND CHEATING AND CHEATING AND CHEATING AND CHEATING. He has ONLY admitted to what I had literal proof of and shoved in his face. I know for a fact there is so much more, and I’ll probably never know what it all is.

To say my boyfriend was sexually satisfied with me is an understatement. We fucked at least twice a day (we’ve been living together pretty much, he’s not on the lease but i had to start paying for him). I took many hot, hot ass nudes for him because he would beg. He was and is literally obsessed with my body, it could even make him cry, it was honestly a little weird to me, but it made me feel beautiful and special. I could make him come at the snap of a finger and I could make him hard in an instant after that. He always did this one thing that truth be told made me a little uneasy and just seemed like he was simping: nearly every time he would come he would be panting and holding me and say “I could literally never ever possibly have a reason to cheat on you.” It was weird to me because like, I didn’t ask? It’s one of those things you hope is fucking understood without saying out loud you know? Like obviously? Is that supposed to give me butterflies? I don’t know. I assumed it was his way of telling me how sexually satisfied he was with me, and I sure as fuck believed it. HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN LYING THIS WHOLE TIME??????

He has tried to kill him self 3 times since March 20th, and almost tried to more than that. Twice in front of me with anything sharp he could find trying to slit his throat, me having to wrestle him to make him stop, and once last Monday, resulting in a mental hospital stay which is where he currently still is. Sometimes it’s when I tell him I’m done and I can’t fucking do it and he needs to get out of my house. Sometimes it’s when I tell him I’m probably gonna fuck someone else now. Whatever it may be, he’s the one that freaks out and I’m the one that has to calm him down or clean blood off of his neck (superficial wounds), even when the both of us know I’m going through much worse pain. 

He BEGS and SOBS and tries to fucking kill him self for gods sake trying to get me to listen to him when he says he can fix it, he’ll get therapy, we’ll go to counseling, blah blah blah. Do you know how much I want to believe that? How many chances I’ve given this motherfucker? The time? The sex? The money? The love? My family? I have been the only good thing in his life for a long time. I have bled myself dry for him. He has watched what it does to me. Seen me have episodes. Seen me get physically sick from the stress he puts me through. He cries and sobs that he hates himself and loves me with every part of him, but then the same day he does that he can go into the bathroom and text some girl trying to set up plans for 3 AM. 

Thought I would add that we recently decided he is probably borderline too, but he hasn’t been able to be seen by a psychiatrist or anything, he’s been trying to get insurance. Just thought that might be slightly important to add. 2 borderlines, what a storm.

It is just simply my worst nightmare. The pain I feel. The emptiness. The lack of control. The worthlessness - not being enough. The betrayal. I was sober for months but slowly I have gotten back to the point of only being able to cope with liquor, 24/7. I can’t stop. I can’t leave him. This time he is a literal part of me and my fucking family. I try with everything in me but I am nothing without him. And he will not fucking leave me. Being away from him is impossible but being touched by him makes me cringe, unless I’m so drunk that I can’t walk straight.

I’m on a mission to understand the needs to the best of my ability.,2,mkdz17,7,"My fiancé has bpd. A lot of what I read on this subreddit are things that he has said to me. Like a lot of things down to exact wording. “Im always mad at myself for being mad at things that should be little things but they just aren’t for me” he’s always exhausted. Always feeling so intense. Even in times where I’m thinking “oh he must be doing ok lately” I learn that the storm has just been continuing silently in his head. I’ve learned a lot about him over the years but I want to know more. I want to be proactive and not “oh this happened and this is how I need to handle it next time”. Can you please share with me what you need from a partner? Like what do you want someone to say or do for you when you’re “angry over something most people find to be a minor issue”? Or when Your partner is the one who did something to make you experience intense feelings. Or what would you want your partner to do to be reassuring just throughout the day in general? If there are moments where you just want to lay in bed for several days on end, do you want someone who will encourage you to get up and do things you typically enjoy or do you want someone who will lay next to you the whole time(or do you prefer to be left alone for a bit even?). Basically, what’s something you find yourself saying “I wish someone/mg partner would..... “."
I feel like going away and never coming back...,2,mkds01,1,"Today I went to a shopping centre with my mum to get a book I wanted, and I ran into three of my friends there (I’ll call them ‘Sam’, ‘Max’, and ‘Hal’). I talked to them for a little bit until my mother told me that we had to leave, I could either stay with them or go home. I asked them if I could stay with them and Sam, and Max looked at Hal awkwardly, Hal said “no sorry, we don’t have enough seats in the car to take you to my house” even though they have five seats and there was four of them (including Hal’s dad). I offered that my mum take me but Hal said no. I got the message that she didn’t want me there, so I left.

I’ve been crying since. Maybe I should just never speak to them ever again. I was going to Max, Sam and a couple other friends over tomorrow but I just want to cancel it now. I didn’t invite Hal because she’s always been really snappy and insulting and I’ve just had enough of it, so I stay on friendly terms but don’t go out of my way to invite her over (two of my friends have also done the same thing with Hal).

I just want to leave and never speak to anyone I know again, I feel it’d be better that way. Maybe they all just hang out with me out of pity. I just want to cut myself off and never interact with anyone again. I just want to be alone."

I do love her so much but I’m so mad that I always feel so annoyed and triggered by the dumbest things when she’s around and like my mind just won’t let this dumb shit go.

How to cope with feelings of loneliness,3,mkcx98,3,"This past week I downloaded an app that has me tracking my meals. I know that nourishing my body is an important part of self care and I thought this app would be a useful tool. I'm doing this in an attempt to increase my mindfulness over food and it's definitely working in that regard. I've never counted calories (this app calculates the calories for me) or kept a food journal before and it has been illuminating. By doing this, it's become glaringly obvious that I have a problem with emotional eating in the evenings when I am alone. 

My eating habits throughout the day are pretty good. I'm making healthy choices, appropriate portions, and eating at regular times. The problem comes when it's time to log my ""evening snack."" Tonight my evening snack started as a slice of angel food cake with strawberries and whipped cream. Then about an hour later I ate a bowl of cereal - but I was still ""hungry"", so I had some cottage cheese and crackers. But I was still hungry after that so I made some ramen noodles with cheese. In all, my total calorie count for evening snack came to about 1300 calories. 

This happens at night when I'm in my apartment alone. I'd say the predominant feeling is a crushing sense of loneliness and I don't know how to cope with it other than eating to the point of feeling physically uncomfortable. Hence, I do consider this a form of self-harm. I'm not eating to nourish my body. I'm eating to avoid that feeling of loneliness.

So I've been trying to brainstorm alternative (healthier) coping mechanisms. If the troublesome feeling is loneliness, it would make sense to reach out for support. However, it's not exactly appropriate to be calling up my friends at such a late hour. In a pre-covid world, I might make a late-night Walmart run. However, the Walmart here closes by 10pm now. I don't live too far from a bar. I could go there to be around people, but I'm afraid to be drinking around strangers when I'm feeling so vulnerable. The bar solution just seems like a recipe for regrettable sex or even another sexual assault.

I have tried practicing radical acceptance and sitting with the feeling of loneliness, but suicidal ideation and feelings of helplessness come in so quickly. I start thinking that I'm alone. I'm never going to find a place that feels like home or people who feel like family. I am so broken that I'll never be able to change that. I don't think sitting with these thoughts is good for me either.

Surely, I can't be the only BPD person who struggles with being alone. Have you guys found helpful (or at least less harmful) ways of coping with these feelings? Maybe an action or activity I can engage in? Or even a new thought strategy might be helpful."
I truly don’t even understand myself,7,mkcv5e,2,"It’s so frustrating living in a constant state of dissatisfaction.

I don’t know what a normal relationship is like. How do people without BPD act in a relationship? I’ve put up a show with my significant other and constantly smile and act like everything is normal so I can please them. For some reason, they can look right through it and feel the negativity. I don’t know what to do anymore.

It’s terrifying thinking about losing my significant other but at the same time I want to break up and run away.

This illness is exhausting."
DAE Adopt Habits from Others Because You Don't Have An Identity/Sense of Self?,40,mkco87,9,"I have noticed myself doing this a lot lately. I've been adopting some habits or personality traits from characters on TV shows, people I watch on YouTube frequently, etc. It's not always just the good habits, either.

I need help...,3,mkci22,1,How the heck I’m so mad at myself. Why do I keep waiting on someone who’s told me to my face that they will never be the person i need. He never reassures me. I’m mainly the one who initiates to see each other and he rarely tries to even buy anything for us...ex: I mainly buy the food and snacks for us; and if he does it’s for himself and I have to pay for my own stuff. I don’t know why I have such a strong attachment with him. I don’t know what’s wrong with me clearly I don’t like myself as much as I claim to do. I don’t know I’m confused. I’m always thinking about this I get so insecure. Especially when we go to this one store I feel like he just focuses on the cashier girl and I hate it especially when he recommends going there. I’m going to decline the offer and see if he goes himself. I want to end this. This only makes me feel insane. He is not the person he put himself up to be in the beginning. He did some traumatizing things to be that I will never get over in my life. I’m so frustrated with myself why do I stay it’s so easy to just block him. I think about this day and night I never get a fucking break from this. I’ve lost so much time with friends and myself with just always being stuck in my head with this. What is this? I don’t want this how do I just stop this makes me mentally exhausted. I’m so tired of this this has been going on for a couple years now. I don’t get it. It’s not the ego of me getting rejected. Clearly it’s not even the good memories. I just always think about this. I feel like a broken record about this hence why I never tell anyone about this and then I just explode and I’m so MAD at myself. I HATE myself so much. I wish I never had this and I wish I valued myself more and stop selling myself short to him who clearly didn’t deserve me in the first place. I am too good for him. I know I am so what’s stops me? I need advice if anyone is going through this themselves......or just any pointers in general....
Progress feels almost more painful,13,mkc8sy,2,"It’s so hard living like this. So much positivity and fulfillment when you’ve made so much improvement. Joy in progress. Joy in committing to a cause to not only improve your life, but the lives of others. Then, when you backtrack - i.e. f*ck up - the gravity of the fall is like an incremental pile of bricks. 

Over and over this cycle continues. The pain is brutal. It’s almost worse getting back on the horse. The good thing is, while it hurts more and more, it is progress nonetheless. 

Progress is not a straight line - it ebs and flows but so long as it's in the same trajectory, it's within reach. Carry on. Keep it up. Hopefully I am in the minority feeling this way.

Today marks 2 years since my last serious attempt. Never really opened up about this to the public before. But I’m an open book if you haven’t noticed. All I’ve got to say is this. If you’re struggling to find a purpose in life or in someone’s life, don’t. The meaning of life is simply to live. You are considerably lucky to be living and breathing right now.

Why am I like this >.<,2,mkbveq,0,"TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 

My FP was crying and I asked why.. he told me it was because of family stuff and us stuff and everything. I started to cry because I didn't like seeing him so sad. I know he likes space when he's that sad so I asked him if he need space. He said yes for a little while. I walked away and went to my closet. I felt so upset like its my fault.. and it might be. I think I've been stressing him out a lot because my moods have been all over the place and I've been struggling to control myself the last few days. So I sat down and started cutting... I'm afraid he'll notice later and be mad. He should have the right to be sad and cry and worry about himself and not me. I don't want him to think he has to worry about me when he's upset."
It's so hard,5,mkbtwc,1,"So my bpd really didn't manifest itself completely until last year (before they thought I was just bipolar). My parents kicked me out, I had to drop out of college, it's been impossible for me to hold a job, and now I'm couch surfing all because of it and I honestly don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm trans so I know things will get better once I transition but I don't want to wait if there's just gonna be more pain. My own friends have given up on me because I'm too ""borderline to deal with."" 

I'm not necessarily a harm to myself right now I just wish I had people who are my age to talk to about all of this because I feel really alone rn 😞"
Bitterly envious of others and their lives.,21,mkayfh,6,"I'm now 26 years old, and for the first time, I am becoming extremely bitter toward others. Every time my cousin or my sister send me pictures of their outings, or I see a post about a past friend with their friends, doing things in the world, I feel envy. My thoughts are like: *They have a life and I don't. They have friends, or an SO to talk to at the end of the day, and I don't.*

A single mother. Friendless. Living in low income housing. My only hobbies include YouTube, video games if I have the energy, and heavy drinking (which makes everything worse). I have nothing to show for my life but work, two children I have for half the month, and twenty pounds that I've gained from a binge eating habit. I fucking hate myself.

I am extremely envious of my beautiful cousin and my outgoing sister. They have plenty of their own struggles, but they also have other friends. They have a family. I am so fucking lonely."
How to convince my friend with BPD I care about them,3,mkay6b,0,"So I met this girl and we've been friends for a while, but before I knew about their BPD it was a very rocky relationship. I felt as though at times they hated me and would get upset for no reason. Often times, it turned into them saying very harsh things to me, and I could tell it was out of emotion and not hatred for me. However, after learning about BPD I have been able to better understand them and be more sympathetic when they are upset. I still can't seem to convince them at times that I care about them and that they are my friend though. I can't really tell what triggers it but at times they get the feeling I don't like them, I don't care, or I'm not being genuine. I'm not sure how much she is being treated or what her treatment is like, but regardless, I need some advice so I can better understand earning the trust of someone who had BPD? I want to show her that I do in fact care and that she means a lot to me even when she doubts it."
Question for BPD creatives/public figures.,3,mkaxfp,3,"Hi there, I’m an Actor.

And recently my career has been gaining a little traction, and I’ve been presented with the opportunity to go to Film School, becoming a successful actor has always been my dream, only ever since my mental breakdown a year ago I find myself terrified of success.

Those of you who have broken down before as well likely also know how hard it is to deal with the guilt after the fact, as well as the worry that everyone will find out and think you’re a horrible person. I didn’t do anything *gross* if you catch my meaning just to get that out of the way, but I was very emotionally manipulative, suicidal, and crazy, and I overshared VERY much on the internet and I know that if I get any real success, there will be the day that comes when an article gets written about me acting really crazy and awful for a year. I’m not pretending to be the good guy, I wasn’t, and for a long time before and after I wasn’t the good guy, but I now realize that I’m mentally ill and my mental health is my number one priority because I want kids, and I want a family, and I want a happy life and I can’t do any of that if I’m sick.

I’m not gonna pull a BPD and say that I’m fixed completely after 4 months of Therapy, but I’ve since gotten medicated and Therapy, and really the only things that are causing me pain nowadays aren’t the regular BPD symptoms. 

Since starting medication and therapy my moods have become less volatile, the chronic emptiness is gone, dependence on other people and toxic attachments are mostly gone, my anger is well under control, risky behavior, self harm are all gone, and I have people who I’ve known for years and years telling me that I seem like a wildly different person than I was a year ago, and even pre-breakdown, one that’s more stable, healthier, and all around better.

How do I deal with the reality that someday all of it is going to be thrown in my face eventually? Guilt and shame over past things I’ve done is honestly the only thing in my life that’s causing me pain right now, if it wasn’t for all of that I would be genuinely happy and glad to exist.

What should I do?"
My (F) GF is her exGF's favorite person,3,mkawo5,1,"My girlfriend is friends with her ex who has BPD and my girlfriend is her ex's ""favorite person."" My girlfriend has said to me that she is afraid of what the emotional/physical consequences of her leaving the friendship (it can be quite toxic or even abusive at times) or talking about our relationship might be. I think that her ex has said that my girlfriend is the only thing she lives for, so my girlfriend is afraid that her ex will stop living if she isn't taking care of her. Any advice?"
I've reached burnout,12,mkavk0,2,"I'm honestly just so drained by everything. Nothing excites me. Every day is the same. I feel like I have zero time to myself to just be me. Yet at the same time I feel so fucking lonely. I just want to crawl into bed with someone and receive endless cuddles and lovins until I'm recharged, but nope can't have that shit. 

I'm just exhausted. Life just feels so bleak and meaningless. Like a fucking mouse running in a wheel never going anywhere. Sure I got my own place, my own car, I got a job and I make money and I can live comfortably..but just..everything feels so meaningless. Like..this is it? This is life?"
New to bpd and Reddit,1,mkas9t,1,"Hello! I’m new to this group, I’m looking for some help or guidance from people who experience this personally. I’m wondering if it’s possible to have BPD without the fear of losing someone. In fact knowingly sabotaging a relationship."
'Everyone thinks I'm so annoying' 'everyone hates me' -says my brain to myself.,3,mkapwb,1,Just needed a safe space to vent perhaps I might feel better after. Suffering from BPD and also addiction is hard. Today i am 11 days sober. That's huge for me truly. Thats the longest ive been sober in 3 years. Today is really really hard for some reason. I deleted all my contacts for connects to get high once I went into rehab before. I have a few friends that still get high. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that i crave the high. I messaged a few people today to try and make something happen. Nothing panned out. But i feel even worse now than i did before. They read and didn't reply. My brain tells me that its because I am a bad person and they didnt reply because they dont like me. My logical part of my brain kinda says maybe they didnt want to aid in my addiction? That is quickly replaced with thoughts from my bpd brain saying it's my fault that i dont have connects because no one wants to talk to me and no one cares. Even reading over this post now as i type I almost feel to need to delete it all because i dont want to sound like a freak who complains and be that person that everyone hates. Ugh. Im struggling hard today. I have no one right now. I know the people i messaged asking for drugs will talk about me to our other friends. I wonder what they will say. I'm so fucked up right now about this. God i sound like such a whiner. This is exactly why my friends didn't message me back.
"Surprised with (Quiet) BPD, but high functioning",5,mkankh,0,"I found out recently by accident that my psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD. I was stunned. He has me on medicines for anxiety and depression, and he has never mentioned anything else. He has never recommended therapy of any sort.

Lots of what I have read about BPD rings true for me. I have a lot of difficulty with emotional regulation. I hide it well, but sometimes I am close to meltdown inside. I have never been in love, and while I’ve had a number of close friendships, I’ve started keeping people at a distance. I’ve also struggled with binge eating disorder since I was a child, and I think my BPD stems from years of undisclosed sexual abuse and parents who didn’t soothe or teach me anything about my feelings or managing my emotions. 

I don’t act out. I don’t use drugs, I don’t drink, I’ve never had any involvement with law violations, except for a traffic ticket five years ago. I am enrolled at a top 10 law school where I am in the top 10% of my class. I put on a show when I am around people. I am bubbly, funny, smart, earnest, hard-working, genuine. Sometimes that is true, but other times, I’m faking it, and I find it EXHAUSTING to me about people for long periods of time. 

I am REALLY struggling with the diagnosis. I’m angry my doctor didn’t tell me or refer me for counseling. I’m angry I didn’t know about this diagnosis before starting down the road toward a promising legal career. 

I sort of wish someone had told me several years ago. I have worked SO HARD to try to make up for what I had perceived to be poor social skills. I even considered if I might be on the autism spectrum, because I used to have really bad social anxiety and could not relate to people my age at all. If I had know earlier, maybe I wouldn’t have tried so hard. I’m not materialistic. Maybe I should have pursued SSDI or part-time, low-wage employment.

I don’t know if I can “fix” this. It feels pretty hopeless, and I’m terrified."
DAE give stuffed animals personalities? TW: suicide,8,mkalp0,10,"Okay so, this has been something I’ve been doing since a child. Obviously most people have toys as kids and their parents may have played with them/given them personalities ... my parents did this a lot. They’d have voices and their own personalities. I’ve taken this into my teen years and even adulthood, I am turning 30 this year.
I have one particular Bear (his name is also Bear). I sleep with him every single night .. even when I stay away from home. I take him to hospital when I’ve attempted suicide or any other reason such as a recent surgery I had on a broken leg. I also cuddle him when I’m feeling down/overwhelmed. 
He has a voice that I put on for him, a complete personality and I basically treat him like another human. My boyfriend goes along with it too, setting him up in funny places, sending me pictures of him doing stuff while I’m at work etc... 
I work as a nanny and so I tell the kids about him like he’s a full on person.. it’s not just sometimes, it’s every single day.
Sometimes I’ll even express my own needs through him; for example telling my boyfriend “Bear is craving chocolates and asked to pick some up for him at the shops.”
I have a few theories as to why I do this but I was just wondering if anyone else does this too?

I’ve read in a few places that people with BPD and CPTSD (which I have both of) sometimes do similar things but I just thought I’d ask if anyone else does this.

I guess at the end of the day, I’m not worried because it makes me happy and makes me laugh, it’s a coping thing for me. Obviously though sometimes I feel like an utter whacko.

Thanks in advance."
I need help,2,mkafr8,1,"I’ve been gradually cutting myself off from the world the last few years by accident while seeking help. I have gotten none. I’m in the UK and unable to go and talk to a stranger over the phone about my situation. I’m worried that i’m going to do something stupid soon and need a therapist. I have no money and can’t talk to a non medical professional either, such as a gp receptionist for fear of being judged. What are my options how do i fix myself"
Loneliness is a disease,4,mkadbl,1,"I think my BPD used to be manageable because I had a friend group and I was always distracted or i would be smoking pot to turn off my emotions, but now i do not have any close friends I speak to on a daily basis and I quit smoking 3 months ago. Sometimes I feel so desperate for social interaction and a close bond with someone that I get so excited when anyone reaches out to me or puts minimal effort. I really miss having a best friend to hang out with regularly, it's been 3 years since I had a close group of friends and now all my relations are mostly surface level and I feel like there is something wrong with me. How can I cope with this loneliness? I feel guilty as well because I should be grateful for what i do have-i have great parents, a nice house, food on the table and I am able to pursue my dreams but I still feel a huge gaping hole in my heart. I even tried to manifest friends and I know that sounds silly. Does DBT help with these feelings of chronic emptiness/loneliness?? Or if anyone has any advice to cope with being alone pls comment, thank you."
i’m completely lost and have no idea what to do. 20F,4,mkabns,3,"the loneliness i feel is so intense that words can’t properly describe it. i have had this loneliness for many years. it gets worse with age. sometimes i feel so deeply connected to certain people but then what i assume is reality hits and i realize i’m not actually connected to this person/these people like i thought. i have group of people who love and support me but.. there will always be a wall that i will never be able to tear down. between myself and everyone. no matter how hard i try. there’s something that’s just WRONG. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything wrong. i cant keep doing this. 

 i have been struggling with this mental illness among others for years now and it has always been hard. i feel like i hit a new “rock bottom” every single month. it always feels like i’m in so much emotion pain and stress that there is no possible way it could get worse. it always gets worse.  or that’s what it feels like. it never gets better. 

i’m sorry that this is all over the place. i have no idea what to do anymore. i can hardly tell what’s real and what’s not anymore. i don’t know who i am. i am so lost. i cant take this anymore."
What feels the worst is when everything is irritating,2,mka543,1,"Why does it have to be like this? 
My boyfriend is exceptionally supportive and sweet and is constantly trying his best. Yet almost every little thing he does will wear on me when I get like this. Oh he called it “za” instead of pizza. Is that cool? Not really. Is it a really something I need to feel like is a personal attack on me because he should know I wouldn’t think that’s cool? Absolutely not. But that’s still what it feels like. Goddamn every other sentence out of his mouth feels like that. He doesn’t deserve that. 
So the point is how do I stop with this? It’s maybe once a week or so. Or when I’m PMSing. I don’t know what to do about it but it is extremely challenging. I’m losing my mind I just want to be able to hang out with him. I have to avoid him when I’m like this because I’m an asshole to him and then he just feels bad. It’s so fucking obnoxious to be me."
impulsivity and other factors really getting me down,5,mk9vxs,4,"hi friends,

I struggle a lot with impulsivity in regards to my BPD. I spend a lot of money on trivial things, get tattoos, dye or cut my hair, promiscuous texts with strangers, or researching the next big change I want to make in my life and then never making it because I'm terrified. But if I'm not hyper-fixated on these impulsive choices, I feel ... an itch or a tension to just DO SOMETHING. it's like I need the release of these stupid behaviours to get through my emotions? idk if that makes sense. 

I thought about using an app like calm harm to ""ride the emotional wave"" but I haven't tried it yet because I'm scared to be alone with my thoughts. I've relapsed in self harm this week even though I was 8 months clean. It's my 27th birthday tomorrow and I just keep thinking about everything bad in my life, rather than good.

 I also have a physical disability that's getting worse and getting me down. apparently people with my disability are more prone to mental illness so that's fun. Not sure if this is just rambling now but, ugh. Advice?"
Being dropped from DBT,4,mk9v1q,5,"This is going to be a bit of a rant but.  My therapist team has told me maybe DBT isn’t right for me at the moment because basically my drug & alcohol use has been getting really bad again.  And Altho I’m getting drug & alcohol councelling on top of this , they still have an agenda against people who use drugs & im just heartbroken to be honest. They told me that I should just stick with the drug& alcohol councelling see how that goes.  But I was planning to do that anyway.  Then they say they gonna try me with CBT team instead.  Which said I needed DBT not CBT, passed me back to my DBT team. And Altho I’m on the phone to them multiple times a week having a crisis. How could they drop me like this.  It feels like I’m being passed from pillow to postI’m genuinely baffled & feels like no one wants me.  

Rant iver"
"I sat in my backyard today, since my Cat passed.",5,mk9f73,6,"One of my cats passed away back in August of 2020. He passed away in my backyard, under one of the outdoor chairs that he was known to rest under.  
I was destroyed when I found him. I hyperventilated, had panic attacks and laid beside his dead body for about two to three hours, until my Mom and my sister's boyfriend discarded of his body.

After his passing, I sunk into a clinical depression that I haven't gotten out of.  
I lost my job. I've lost friends. I've lost family. My relatives hate me for not seeing them. I've stopped doing everything I enjoy. I've stopped leaving my room. I've stopped taking my medication. I'm always self-harming. I would sometimes spend weeks in my room without leaving it, without eating. I've lost so much weight that I've become a walking stick.  
My Mom will harass me through phone now and again, I'd let her know I'm still alive.  
I'm in horrible physical shape and was threatened to be hospitalized, but I was able to convince them that I wasn't suicidal and would start caring more for myself.   
I'll be getting treatment soon through DBT classes.

I rarely step outside the house, I prefer not too because of the anxiety I face and how terrible I look physically.. I'm horribly unattractive. COVID has enabled me a lot with isolating myself.  
I used to play in the backyard with my cats, I haven't stepped into the backyard since his passing.  
I didn't last very long today. I sat on the steps for a few minutes until my eyes wandered onto the spot he passed. I broke down and haven't stopped crying since.

I still feel immense guilt and shame about his passing. He died young, and I feel like it was my fault. I feel like I could have saved him. I feel like I let him down. He was one of the only things in my life that kept me going. We loved each other so much, he tried so hard to heal me, and I fucking failed him. I can't forgive myself for his death. I don't want to forgive myself for his death. I feel like I deserve to suffer.

I'm starting DBT soon and admittedly I feel like this would be stupid to bring up.  
I'll be in a group with other people, which I really dislike. I have a horrible tendency to compare my issues with the other group members, and my issues seem and feel so irrelevant, stupid and unimportant.  
My life issues are nothing compared to what the others face.   
Being suicidal and destroying myself over a Cat would seem minor and like a joke. They are all dealing with so much, with real problems, and I'm here crying over a Cat.  
Why am I even joining DBT, I feel pathetic?

..I don't know what I'm getting at. I'm just tired and really needed to vent. I don't have anyone to talk too about the things I'm going through, or the things I feel.  
This is probably stupid, I'll delete soon.

Thanks for reading, I guess."
I am having a manic episode and don’t know what to do,1,mk9f07,5,"I feel absolutely insane right now. I need to get up and drive far far away and I’m 10 seconds from doing it. I can’t stop crying and blaming myself for everything. I don’t have anyone near me for support. I FEEL LIKE IM GOING CDAZY. Like I need to do soemthing. I’m about to start drinking but I keep holding off but I can’t much longer, I’m losing my mind :(((( someone help me please how do I calm this feeling"
i can’t live like this anymore,6,mk9dck,2,"i really love you, but this love hurts me. i shouldn't continue this. i have to leave. you make me feel even more sick. it hurts so much i can not breathe. my feelings can change just in a moment. i just need to see, hear or think about you. what I have in my head, what I realize, my thoughts, true or not, they can change my feelings. my whole mood changes. one moment i am happy, then i start crying and start feeling that i will never be healthy. thats whats happening now. i was really happy, without a reason even trying to hold back my affection not to show you any more love. not to make myself more stupid. and everything changed just in a second. now i am crying, feeling stupid, questioning my actions. i hate it that you have such an influence on me. even if i leave you, i know the cycle will repeat itself with the next person. i will always suffer. i don’t know how to stop this, all i know is that i cannot continue with this cycle any longer. i feel like there is nothing that can fix me. i want to be the center of my life, me, not another person. but i cant do it and i hate it. it hurts. it hurts now even when i’m crying."
Bpd and eating disorders,2,mk97h6,4,"Anyone else have an eating disorder? I have quiet BPD and I'm not formally diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I definitely have one. I lost over 50 pounds so quickly. I look disgusting and like myself even less now that I have all this loose skin. I have an even bigger urge to harm myself. I can't even look in a mirror anymore. I keep telling myself to just eat, but I'm not hungry. And then I forget to eat or eat very little because I just don't want anything. Any ideas on how to fix myself?"
"Need skills, or something, just anyone",1,mk8sze,7,I am in the ER RN because of a suicide attempt. And I just found out my girlfriend and FP cheated on me after swearing i was the only one she had eyes for and she loved me. She replaced my name on her Instagram bio with his. I just feel like my entire world is collapsing and i don't know what to do.
"I made a mistake while driving, and now I want to kill myself.",3,mk8k10,4,"I was doing an okay job at holding myself together today, and in an instant it's all gone. Not just driving, this mistake makes me want to give up on everything else in my life too.

Instantly after it happened, my mind started going down the list of my ambitions and dismissing them all: ""I'm too worthless, incompetent, stupid, mentally ill, ugly, and meek to make any of them happen. I can't show my face in this town again. I have to go start over in another town now - until I make another mistake there, then I'll have to move again. I'm irredeemable because of all the mistakes and stupid things I've done dating back to kindergarten. I'm a bad person with bad thoughts. No one could like me and I'll only detract from their life. I don't like anything about myself. I don't like life. I really need to die right now.""

I have a general sense of confusion that is one of the worst thing I experience mentally. I think it's a symptom of my derealization and BPD together. The confusion gets really bad when I'm stressed. It just makes me want to beat my head (and I have) because it feels blocked - I can't understand any of my intense emotions, what led to what, or why. I can't put things into perspective, and I absolutely cannot validate my own feelings.

I've lived my life with my head down and not sharing myself because I don't know what is okay and what isn't, and I've always cared a lot about what others think. I can't handle any sort of conflict because I feel worthless and wrong no matter what. I've been a chameleon with no true identity and no mental stability as far back as I can remember. I've always been secretive about myself, and I never really understood why. It deeply bothers me that I'm not able to understand myself.

I don't know where to start in order to get better. I don't have a clear picture of what better is. It feels like there is just too much to work through. I'm scared of going back to therapy because I don't want to feel invalidated again. I know there is a lot of trial and error when trying to find a therapist that clicks with you, and money is tight. I always came out of therapy sessions feeling more hopeless."
Does anyone know any good online therapy?,2,mk7srn,4,Preferably cheap! I am on a waiting list for BPD therapy but only after my ED therapy and I still haven't got into that yet.

i think i have an FP and it’s killing me,1,mk78gh,3,"i have this really close friend who also has BPD and recently she came to my uni so we’ve been in close proximity for a while. we hooked up once in november and have made plans to do so again but nothing set in stone. we had feeling for each other in 2019 but it all kinda fizzled out to the friendship we have now. 

i’m trying to be understanding because she claims to be going through a hard time but she seems to have time for everyone else. 

at first, i thought i was just being sensitive cause in all fairness she was only posting snapchat’s with her uni friends after not being at uni for ages. but then the other day she posted pics of her and her friends on insta. and again i tried to chill. but then she posted a tiktok and now i’m so triggered. 

we haven’t spoken in over a month! i mean that’s more than enough time to cal someone back. i’ve basically called her everyday or every other day. 

we literally haven’t argued or anything. i just feel so abandoned and i thought she’d be more empathetic to that feeling cause she also has BPD but she just seems so distant and uninterested in me and it hurts. 

i never considered her my FP before but it’s just triggering trauma from my last FP relationship which is why i think it is. 

i’m so upset right now and have paragraphs to send but i don’t want to make a big deal of it cause she likely isn’t mad at me and i don’t want her to think i’m a baby who can’t handle myself — which i know she probably won’t but i can’t handle the possible negative reaction.  :("
"I've Hit on 8/9 Symptoms Over the Past Week, But Have Come Out of it With a Greater Understanding of Splitting, and Working on the Tools",1,mk741t,1,"This turned out to be a long one - TL/DR at bottom.

My lady friend has been really helpful in really walking me through stuff, and helping me to understand the disease.

She's been staying with friends for a while, due to my last uhh, I guess it would be a ""period of intense depressed mood.""

The last argument we had was over something so trivial as well. A tiny misunderstanding on my part lead to me spiraling and ""splitting,"" I had asked her not to bother me about a certain thing.... And she wasn't.... But that's how I perceived it. 

So I went to a different room to try to lay down and cool off. She came in to try to help soothe me (great) but after a few attempts to explain herself I just went off on her, and hard. This lead to me sleeping in another room for the night.

We didn't really talk about it the next day, I don't know if that's either of our faults really but yeah, it's a huge mistake everytime. She went to her parents place to hang out the next morning.

Anyway, after brewing and ruminating on it alone for some while, I decided that it was time to turn to the other tool in my kit currently - Alcohol. And I lashed out, letting her know I'd be drunk when she came back, amongst a bunch of other shit.

This is when she left for her friends house - luckily I was already thrashed and sleeping when she returned to the place to grab some things.

The thrashing went on for a few days, passing out after finishing my supply, going to buy more, the whole time looking at the noose, I finally reached out to the boys and tried my hardest to not lash out at them, but still explain myself, and amazingly we made plans for a couple days out. So I figured I owed it to them, to see them and have a one more good time, ""last hurrah"" or what have you. 

My Mom came over around day 3-4 ish to stay the night and keep me safe, still all the while I was drunk. She fed me and everything, I love her to death. Sometimes we're not worthy yaknow? Cuz God knows I've split on her before.

And then, luckily right before my fun day with the boys, I had a psychiatrists appointment - and got to spill some real stuff to her about the past few days. Couldn't have timed that shit better, it was the most therapeutic visit I've had the whole time with this doctor. I'm always scared to open up about the suicidal thoughts though.

She doubled the dose on like everything, and added an anti alcohol medication for me. So after sucking down a few pints with the boys (not without me crying over it), picking up a couple 6 packs to tide me over for the pharmacy visit, I went home to drink and sleep, tomorrow would be a better day.

I've picked up my new meds now, and the alcohol ones have been doing some wonders tbh, I have had a couple urges, but later at night, instead of constantly throughout the day like I used to. I assume it's because I take the shit in the morning and it wears off.

The one thing - and she warned me - with the heavier dose of Prozac, I need to do it with food. Threw that shit straight up the second day cuz I didn't listen.

My girlfriend came over last night though, after I sobered up and adjusted my meds. We had a good chat. She said it was the best we'd had in years, before she went to go back to her friends house. I feel abandoned really, but I know shes coming back, because we're both committed to working on it. We'll be having dinner tonight.

Anyway, I hope the ramblings regarding my past week or so help you guys to maybe figure some shit out, or something, I'm not really sure why I wrote, but I sorta wrote my title to the post.

Sorry to mods if I've flaired the post the wrong way.

Thanks Everyone!

TL/DR:

The symptoms were a wild ride this week.

I understand that my tendency to split, or identify good deeds and wrong deeds as coming from separate entities (a good person, and a bad person), has been a major contributor to my wildly different interactions and thoughts regarding my love ones.  

I am taking small steps to make myself better there, and trying to not use absolute language when thinking of the  things that my loved ones do. And yay for trying to get back on the wagon.

Hoping this will lead to less angry outbursts, less abandonment issues by proxy."
(i‘m the FP) - he hurts himself every time he accidentally upsets me. i can’t take this anymore.,14,mk7206,9,"TW: self harm

i‘m the FP of my bpd family member. every time he does something that visibly upsets me (usually by accident), especially if it‘s a big thing where i lash out, he goes away and hurts himself. i can hear the pounding (and sometimes crying/ grunting) coming from the other room and it’s unbearable. then he comes back with red body parts and is cooling himself under the tap, holding unto the body parts he hurt. he is super nice to me right after and offers to do very chores i‘m perfectly capable of myself, offers to take everything out of my hand (what i suppose is an attempt at „making things right“). 

i feel really uncomfortable and horrible about this. i refuse his help because it would feel wrong. I really don’t know what do in these situations. i can’t have him harm himself for me. i don’t know what to do.

i am so overwhelmed by all of this. i can’t feel responsible for someone watching my every move and hurting themselves if they think they „hurt“ me. i can’t take it. i can’t constantly watch what i do and say to make sure they don’t hurt themselves because of me. 

i know they can’t control it but it’s also killing me inside. i also know that it’s him punishing himself for me. that makes it even worse to bear. 

do you know what it feels like to see someone you love and care about come back into the room with bruises holding their limbs grunting in pain - all because they got the wrong cereal and you got upset. 

please tell me what to do because it’s killing me to see my love one destroy their body because of me , even worse, for me

how do i react ? how do i avoid this? can i do anything about it to make it stop?"
I’m missing my FP who is my ex.,1,mk6zvz,3,My FP texted me today and I miss her already she probably texting her new bf and it’s making me really jealous and anxious. I can’t think of anything else but it.
Rant,4,mk6yvc,1,"This is my first time post, so I apologize if it isn’t cohesive... I’ve been in an out of counselling and therapy for a couple years and been diagnosed with BPD for a while but the diagnosis never bothered me. I was more concerned with how I felt and how I feel in a given time. These days I don’t even know what feelings are because Ontario has been in lockdowns for months i just transferred to another uni in a different city and that’s exactly when covid hit 

Plus I’m an international student here so that made it better being in a new city all alone just in a dorm.. I met some ppl along the way but I’ve been so concerned with being a nuisance or a bother to people so I’ve always kept my distance even when they ask to hang coz I feel like bother. 

I’ve decided to change all this but I’m hit with my  own self deprecating negative thoughts and I have no clue sometimes what to do with it. 

Thanks for taking time to read this... I just kinda wanted to rant, sorry if I wasted your time 

Hope y’all have a good day and stay safe"
Ex messaged me today to hookup after 3 months and I am proud of myself!,547,mk6qf5,63,"So we hadn’t talked for three months, I messaged him March 19th to see what was up (he promised me that we would talk as time passed and I held onto that so I wanted to see if he’d keep his promise. At this point I didn’t really care at all about actually talking to him). He ignored that message completely. 

Today, Easter, he messaged me saying “hey, I know it’s been a minute, but do you wanna hookup? Strictly that.” Back in December he asked the same thing and manipulated me into giving consent. 

And now, friends, I am proud today to say that I did not reply to his message at all. I deleted it and continued rather than giving him a piece of my mind and say everything I’ve wanted to say for 3 months I realized that would do nothing and he hasn’t learned at all from his behavior so it’s pointless. He just embarrassed himself. He looks like a joke. And now I feel like I’m the one who has control.

This is such a big thing for someone with BPD and so I’m happy with myself. If I didn’t learn from my last mistakes I wouldn’t be doing this."
i can’t imagine being loved,78,mk6jpv,13,"i can’t even comprehend it. every time someone tries to get close to me i stop things from becoming serious. 
when someone says they care about me, this inner monologue starts in my head where i tell myself they’re lying to me or they’re mocking me or they’re kidding themselves and just don’t know any better. i think they’ll change their mind so i should put a stop to it before i get hurt. i’ve been doing it since i was 12 years old. 
i can’t even explain it. i literally can not even imagine being loved for who i am. i can’t imagine someone caring about me because they want to and not because their life sucks or they have no friends or because i’ve tricked them. 
i can’t imagine someone knowing who i am and still loving me. i get attached to people i know i can’t have so i can blame them not loving me on things like distance or circumstances. i’m so afraid of being vulnerable. it makes me feel like i could die. 
i’ve never not regretted it. i’m so tired of being this way but i just can’t rewire my brain and thinking. 
i tell myself i should be with people who i don’t love so it won’t hurt when they hurt me or leave me or cheat on me or die."
best friend who knew i had bpd lied to me about...pretty much everything. lie after lie. after i put all of their trust into them. promised me all the shit they ended up lying about,2,mk6jk3,8,"i feel so disgusting. they hurt me and many others. they knew my biggest bpd triggers and put them against me. i hate them, but i hate myself even more. i feel so stupid"
My ex partner was diagnosed with BPD...,9,mk6jey,2,"I decided to post on this subreddit because I realized that the other BPD subreddits tend to be super negative and demonize people with BPD a lot. I'm not downplaying their experiences, but I just know that mine hasn't personally been that way 

My ex partner disclosed to me that he was diagnosed with bpd during an argument we had (for awhile i had urged him to get help over suicidal thoughts and depression). I'm not really sure how to process this information, i thought that seeing other people's experiences with people with BPD would give me more clarity but it almost stained my image of him because everyone just seemed so negative :/

I believe that when it comes to his illness, he doesn't seem to project it onto me very often (usually only during arguments) I've known him for two years now, and he seems to be more on the quiet side of the spectrum of the disorder. He does have a fear of abandonment but I've never witnessed him split on me really unless if its during an argument (which he usually apologizes after, (I'm assuming this is the guilt consuming him afterwards). Sometimes he also does suicide threatening gestures during arguments but since ive asked him to stop he hasnt done it again. Otherwise he is usually pretty loving and caring, usually puts my feelings first and I never thought that his intense emotions would boil down to a diagnosis of BPD I just assumed he was suffering from depression.

How can I understand him better? He is my ex but I do still plan on keeping him in my life and I still care about him. What are some things I can do to help him out? Can his diagnosis lead to a positive prognosis?"
broke up w my bf Bc he called someone i don’t like,1,mk62rx,2,"I broke up with my bf/best friend last night when i was high. We’d been together since last June and had a fairly healthy relationship, but he did remain friends with an abusive ex-bf of mine for longer than he probably should have (he knew about the abuse). It’s worth noting he’s since cut off the guy and apologized to me for it. What led me to break up with him was a couple weeks ago he and I were on vacation and while we were having a night in he decided to leave the room to call his friend (f) who said some misogynistic things to me. They only talked for 20-30 minutes, and I hung out with his brother, but I haven’t been able to get over it. I was so happy with him before that, but after the call I haven’t been able to see him the same. I don’t know if I’m in an episode and I’ll regret this or not and none of my friends are answering me."
My mother finally got diagnosed,22,mk5w01,7,"So, my mom finally got diagnosed with BPD at the ripe ol’ age of 53 years old(after I managed to convince her to see a psychiatrist) and I thought I’d join this sub to get a better insight of what is going on in the mind of people who has this diagnosis, and maybe use some of the experiences mentioned here to help here in some way if she needs it. Even though my childhood has been problematic because of her, I still feel like I owe it to her, at least. 
I mean, she, a single mother with undiagnosed BPD, raising a kid(me) who is diagnosed with childhood autism and ADHD, and still manage to raise it into becoming am independant adult who has a future, and friends???  I owe it to her. I wanna do my best to try and support her."
You all are valid. Period.,196,mk5uk6,13,"You are all valid. That’s all I want to say. No matter what you’ve been through, it’s valid. So many of us have been through trauma and abuse that hasn’t been recognized. And I just want to say, you’re valid. You’re seen. You’re recognized.
This is a horrible disease. So many of us are lost, and it’s a loss. BPD doesn’t have to mean the end. I lost my aunt to it, and it hurt my whole family. BPD isn’t the end. Please know this. There are people who care about you. This group is proof!!"
Im sad oh so sad i want to fucking die,8,mk5t7k,2,"Hi friends I want to die. I’ve gained so much weight I look at myself in the mirror and I’m just so tired... it’s so exhausting to hate yourself so much. Worst thing is knowing What I have to do to control my weight and have not only no motivation to do what I need to do but also despair over not having motivation. 

Im such a pos. When I see a good looking woman I want to curl up in a ball. In those moments I literally feel that I would be better off dead than look how I do. 

Im disgusting. My bf has helped me enough to where I don’t feel fear of abandonment over my looks bc he’s so loving and supportive but... idc if he thinks I look good... I know I’m disgusting.

I want to die over this it haunts me everyday and I can’t stop binge eating and when I think I’m doing well I weigh myself only to find out I weigh more than I did when I was over eating. And then I binge bc what’s the point. 

FRIENDS I HATE Myself. This amount of despair cant be normal. I can’t bring myself to work out. I hate myself."
My therapist is my FP,2,mk5q0g,4,"I've tried about eight different therapists in my life, but this has never happened to me before. My current therapist is the same age and at the same life stage as me and shares all of the same interests, even to the point of being eerily similar to me. We connected from the first session, and I feel like I'm in love with him. I think about him like 70% of the time no matter what I'm doing or where I am. I have detailed sexual fantasies and romantic fantasies about him, which makes me feel creepy, but I can't stop having these thoughts. I don't think I've shown him any indication of how I feel beyond platonic liking and appreciation. In one session, he described me as ""attractive"" (I don't think he crossed any professional boundaries, though, because it was in the context of something else rather than a direct compliment). The way he looks at me, though, my intuition is that he feels the same way. 

I'm conflicted because I know that these types of thoughts interfere with therapy, but at the same time he's helped me more than any other therapist so I don't want to stop seeing him. Bringing this up to him feels impossible. What should I do?"
How do I reach out?,1,mk57xe,2,"I don't really have any friends. I live with my family but I don't think they can help me ( they dont believe that there are middle grounds for mental illnesses, just you are either ""depressed and need help"" or ""normal and life is hard so deal with it"")(before you say to move out and live on my own, I did, I did go abroad for 3 to 2 different countries). 
I am not diagnosed with bpd yet, but this sub relates with me in so many levels than other mental health subs. Why not just consult a psychitrist? The local psychiatrist from where I lived only diagnosed me with ""imagining myself that I have some mental illness, that I found on internet"". 
I am currently 24. As long as I remember, no year went by without feeling lonely. Don't want to go on much details on that. Is it because my mind is clouded that I cant remember good stuffs? No. There were good stuffs. But most of the moments (good or bad) were just me all alone. So why am I desperately wanting a friend? Why cant I just be normal and accept my loneliness and build my self on my own? Is it because I am thinking that ""I cant do it?""
I could go months without talking to anyone except my parents (who care about me a lot in their own way.), which is also for a less than an hour every week, while I was abroad. 
How can I stop feeling lonely? I never had friends most of my life, so why am I feeling so lonely? 
Sadly there arent any dbt groups, therapists from where I live. Its expensive to live where there are therapists in my country and I cant afford it right now. 
I know most of you would think this as a joke, but thats alright. Maybe this is fake and I am just pretending, wasting my time writing all these. 


""Maybe I'll be your friend""  = gets bored of me before a week.
""I can help you"" = ""have you heard of Internal locus of control, where you stop blaming others and focus to solve problems on your own?""
""I wont ignore you"" = ghosts me for no reason. 
""You can tell me anything"" = only thing you know is complain 24/7
""Stop pushing people away"" = pushes me away.

Where can I get a friend? A friend who cares enough, not to ghost me. Someone who tries to understand me without rolling their eyes. I don't deserve human company, right?
(Bad english? not so sure why, language center is all messed up)
And yeh, this post wont make any sense to me within 6-8hrs. Feels bad enough to delete posts like these after sleep."
Apologized to my ex... Felt awesome.,4,mk57m7,2,"Before I say this, I don't have any feelings for this man anymore... But I did feel the need to apologize. So my ex, we dated for 2 years, 2016-2018. I treated him like complete shit. My BPD was untreated and I didn't know any coping mechanisms at all. I was horrible. He still wanted to work things out with me and then I left him because I thought I didn't deserve him. Then, he found someone else and I got mad. Yeah. Stupid. I know. But I wouldn't speak to him but we finally will kinda talk now.. I don't wanna piss his lady off too much though. She doesn't like me, even though she's never met me, and I guess I can see why. I asked him if he wanted me to stop talking to him and he said no. I told him I was sorry for everything. I still care for him platonically and hope he's okay, and happy. I just never had any examples of love growing up, either. He said he understood, and I didn't even have to apologize to him because it was always okay. It still felt good, and I'm proud of myself. I used to have a huge issue apologizing."
heartache?,2,mk52uv,0,My mom just keep hurting me emotionally over and over again daily and neither of my parents were affectionate towards each other. My dad would slap me if he was frustrated and if I got B would say how come u didnt get an A and would yell at us when driving i feel like my sister got most of the brunt yet somehow was closer to him and now he is decased and my mom used to call me fat and has no idea when my spring break is and has not made anytime for me to go over things and wanted to cry today bc i just never felt loved or cared for by my parents yet i still try to talk to my mom etc but when i see her everytime she get annoyed or something and commets abotu my tattoos or my weight gain or clothes and keep cimoparing me to my past self and how it not her job to teach me how to do taxes or how i used ot be so pretty and used to do my makuep well and not anymore and she also would never stand up to my dad when he yell or somethign whcih is not a good role model i just cant wait to leave this shit small town and my house with my mom and sibling and maybe i do isolate mself and yeah im lonely as ever but happier alone  no one belive me i have BPD BUT THE proff is in hte pudding and worst part is people think my mom is freindly and too faced but she is not a great mother yet somehow loveds kid
Thing's are (kinda) looking up,2,mk4q0y,3,"3 weeks ago I attempted to take my own life. After I got fired in December my life went on a downwards spiral, but tomorrow I am starting a new job, I am worried because it's the same sort of work as I got fired from which is very stress enducing but I am going to give it my best shot, if it doesn't work out then it doesn't work out. Having a job will help bring some normality into my life and god knows I need the money haha.

I am on some medications which means I won't be able to drink for atleast 9 days, since October I have not gone longer than 7 days without a drink, so again I think this will be beneficial for me, and when the 9 days is up it will be a monday so with work I probably won't be drinking until that weekend anyway.

I was outside the other night and my FP (maybe ex FP idk how I feel yet) drove past, I didn't know he was back in town, I had a very breif meltdown, I was going to drink but I stopped myself because of the meds and I'm so glad I did because it would've made everything worse.

And that night I caught up with an old friend, I haven't seen him since something quite bad involving him happened, I was convinced I would sleep with him, I knew I didn't want that and I didn't sleep with him. He was there right before my downwards spiral began and has seen the major change in my life over the past 8 months and seeing him kinda just made me feel like myself again.

A guy I'm in a kind of messed up FWB situation with is going away for a few weeks, I think this will be good to help me sort out my feelings for him, after my suicide attempt we were meant to be giving each other space because he found a girl he has a connection with (he's going away to see her) but only 3 days later he came over and the only 3 times I've seen him since my attempt we've slept together and it's really clouding my judgement on how I feel about him, he also told me that he had been sleeping with other girls before my attempt when we were ""seeing each other"" which he had lied bc he told me he hadn't but knowing all these other girls want him makes me want him now haha.

I'm trying to hold a positive attitude as much as I can, I am sort of doing a 'fake it till I make it' type thing, but I really need to turn my life around because I am going down a very bad path, I'm trying my best to just accept things and let them play out."
I lost my shit at someone,2,mk4boe,5,"Fuuuuuck 

I normally keep it all ""inside"". I have such turbulence with my feelings but I hide it as  much as I can so I'm either ""super happy"" or ""a bit low"" to others.

Recently I've just been done. I'm just sick of everything and I've given up. 

I was told I should reach out to people so I reached out to my group. They were nice about it...it was very hard describing my feelings though

This guy though.

This. Fucking. Guy. 

He admitted ""feelings"" for me a couple of weeks of knowing each other online, at first I kinda liked him even though the idea of a relationship terrified me and I wanted to take it slow. 

He wouldn't listen, he would push more and more. Wanting to meet me irl, wanting to plan trips together, constant compliments when they made me uncomfortable and I'd tell him please stop then later he'd say maybe it'll be good for me if I start letting him compliment me to help work on my issues. 

I found out he's pretty much an asshole. He puts on this caring, thoughtful demeanor to me but is rude as fuck with others. Something constantly didn't feel right: passive aggressive comments, whenever I called him out he immediately begged for an apology like throwing apologies to make the whole issue go away, sometimes I called him out on stuff that happened less than a minute ago and he'd deny he remembers it happening 

I said over and over a relationship won't happen and he held on and wouldn't listen to no. Upset with me if I tried tinder/dating apps, bringing up guys comments on Facebook. 

Sometimes I'd be mad at him and he'd have a meltdown and beg for reassurance from me because I can calm him down. 

Whenever I'd say about my past trauma he'd kept really drilling in ""I'm not that guy. I'm not that kind of person."" And it felt so sketchy for him to say that...it just doesn't feel right like do you have to go on about how you won't drive dangerously for me or won't hit me?

And then I majorly fucked up, I was drunk. He had a couple beers and we sexted. The entire experience was awful and I immediately regretted it. There was one point he ""accidently"" took a screenshot and I just feel sick... I told him afterwards that's never happening again and he wouldn't have it, he said ""if this is something we do as friends sometimes that'd be great"" 

Like, no, never again! 

Welp the next night, the very next night he hits on me. Denied he hit on me literally seconds after then sent me memes through other dms as if nothing happened. I was done. 

I told him I'm not comfortable us talking anymore, we can talk on the server but no more private conversations. Told him he broke a boundary etc 

Well he said he's leaving the server for 2 weeks to ""get over his feelings for me"". Left for 5 days then messaged me saying he needed someone, it seemed serious and he was just stressed about work. 

He then told me hes over me now and comes back. I don't comment. Things are chill in the server then he keeps fucking messaging me privately. I tell him to stop and he does 

Then a week later he says he needs to talk (I haven't blocked him as he's a major part of the group and server I own) and he's begging me to talk to him again, how he's so alone, he's been crying, he's knows he's fucked up beyond repair and he'll do anything. 

None of it feels real at this point...I've said over and over how uncomfortable I am around him, I don't want to talk to him and it just doesn't register...he doesn't care as long as I'm talking to him. He's at his worst 

I tell him I can't do this, I have absolutely no one to talk to about this issue either not wanting to expose what's going on to the rest of the group so I'm like ""wtf do I do?!"" 

I can't keep talking to him, it keeps feeding his delusion we'll be together...I tell him I can't do this and no I don't want to continue talking to him.

Him: really? I've honestly fucked it up that much? 

I realised he doesn't mean ANY of what he's saying...he keeps saying he ""fucked"" up and knows he's messed up expects me to be over it

He told me how he broke a boundary but because of my history with my abusive ex, that's why I feel disrespected...

My jaw dropped...he blamed my trauma from my abusive relationship and why I acting this way...not because he was a disrespectful creep 

He apologised but that was it. We don't speak outside the server 

Well after I reached out he went into my dms today saying he was here if he needed me etc etc all nice and calm 

I saw fucking red. 

I get frustrated, I get stressed, I get annoyed but I never get angry....last time I was angry was yelling at someone 4 years ago. I hide all my anger as much as I can 

But I was done

I said ""of course you do 🙃"" 

He said ""look I'm just trying to offer some reassurance here"" 

I told he's a shit liar and he just wants to talk to me again 

Him: ""I’m really not,Im literally just checking on you to see everything’s ok,I don’t want any more than that,Why would I put myself through all the stress of trying to put things right I already know I’ve done too much to fuck things up""

Me: You are so fucking manipulative

You are such a massive massive asshole

""I've already fucked up so much""

I'm so fucking done 

He was pretty shocked and told me to fuck off and he can't deal with me, I didn't respond and 5 minutes later he responded sorry and he was just shocked I called him manipulative 

I just wrote ""go fuck yourself"" 

Its petty as fuck, I could've handled it so much better but I am so fucking done 

All my fears...just went. I wasn't scared of him outting the screenshot he took to the group and making everyone know I'm a shit human being

I don't care, I'm just fucking done

Bpd and weed,1,mk42yp,22,"Hello fellow borderlines,
I've had this theory for a while now and I need to verify it. Most of the people with bpd I know are stoners.
Are all people with bpd stoners or used to be?"
Why can’t I cry anymore???,4,mk41qe,2,"Does anyone have a problem not being able to cry? 

I have had a good amount of things in the past year that have thrown me over the edge but I’m so numb. I do not take meds. I feel so sad. Empty. Anxious.  Last night I got put over again and rather than cry I just had a bad headache and bad thoughts in my head. I need to release it but I can’t.  I really am at the point where I am fully numb and let down by everyone in my life. No one cares about how I feel, men treat me like i’m not even a person, and I feel so alone. How can I cry and feel anything?"
Currently furious at my partner for refusing to sleep???,1,mk419b,1,"My partner never sleeps and it gives my anxiety because obviously less sleep = more grumpy from anyone and it I’m currently sitting here enraged at him as he’s spent another 12 plus hours awake refusing to sleep and I want to do laundry but it’s a two person task and I feel like we can’t now due to his lack of sleep. I know I’m completely BPD spiraling but he’s gone out to get a tablet , played video games , cooked and all that all while his eyes are drooping and I’m just wanting to do the laundry and we always fight when he doesn’t sleep so I am too afraid to bring it up. He will claim he is fine and go anyways to prove a point and eventually his mood will wear on me . It’s just frustrating because if I stay up too late on a work night he’s nagging me about work in the morning but he can spend 12 plus hours straight awake and not even attempt to sleep . Laundry is a two person task because the Matt is far away and we walk and it’s too much for one person alone - I need him to be fully rested so we can get it all done and now the day is half gone and he’s not even tried . I’ve tried politely to say he should go to sleep but he just isn’t listening and I’m getting angrier and angrier as I sit here doing my own chores but wanting the laundry to be done and knowing I cant handle the argument . If he would just go to sleep I would even sleep out the door with my own things so he doesn’t attempt to join me resulting in a quarrel because he is too over tired to do the work. But he won’t !!! Ugh"
Life feels like such a chore,4,mk3vlb,1,"I'm in a slump right now where everything is just. So much. Cleansing my face, brushing my teeth are so demanding. Having to cook each day. Clean. Do laundry. At the very least I wash my hands obsessively because of OCD and shower daily so no overall hygiene problems.

Every moment I'm not actively occupied by something school related I'm trying to distract myself. Hopping from one show to another before losing interest, not necessarily enjoying myself but tiding myself by not letting myself think.

Only thing that bring me actual joy are sex, hot shower, and just the notion of heat in general. I let ny hands linger longer than necessary to feel some warmth. 

Even food isn't really fulfilling. Honestly it's ironically the lack of fulfillingness that's finally getting me to work on my weight.

I don't know, I just don't know how to pull myself out of this slump. Just trying to ward myself from the thoughts of loneliness, lack of worth and no purpose but everything just feels so empty."
I don’t know who I am,6,mk3igk,1,"I know this is common with BPD but I don’t know what I like or dislike or what I want to do with my life. I feel like an outsider and everyone is has friends and families and *lives* when I have nothing.

My entire life I would fantasize about being a different person, it used to be celebrities when I was younger but now it’s different versions of myself. Versions where I’m wanted. For over a year now it’s fantasizing a life with person I only hooked up with a handful of times while studying abroad and he ghosted me basically. It’s embarrassing and pathetic.

I finished watching the show Felicity and I feel so depressed now because I didn’t want it to end. I’m now finishing college and I wish I lived in that world and had those friends and those relationships because I’ve lost my roommates/friends because of my BPD. Certain shows come around for me that are such an escape from my reality, a reality I don’t want to live in.

I wish things were easier for me. I think I’m running out of options and I’ve lived like this for too long to survive much longer."
F*ck it all.,3,mk3903,3,"It's happening. I've pushed him to the breaking point. 

You can never lie to me. Because I've already snooped, I already know the things you tried to hide. You lie. And blame me for snooping. Yep. Well. Oh well right. If you didn't have anything to hide I wouldn't have had to ask about them. And you wouldn't have lied. Either way it was doomed. 

It was a fucked up run and we only had a handful of good times. I'm never doing this again. Relationships are the fucking worst. 

I am the fucking worst."
I am so tired,92,mk35ou,10,"Everytime someone doesn't respond to a message: they hate me. I know I've jumped to this conclusion a million times, but this time it feels like they definitely do hate me.

Everyone just dreads hearing from me. I don't blame them. I tend to come off really strong, or so aloof you don't even know I exist.

My therapist didn't respond the way I wanted. Well, now I hate her and regret saying anything to her.

Oh, a random good day? I guess I lied and faked all those bad days. Why am I even in therapy? I can just have more days like this. Easy.

My friend who's given me so much freaking support just made a dumb joke at my expense. What a total asshole. Guess I have to block him. I knew he hated me.

Resources for managing BPD during pregnancy/child rearing?,2,mk2ugy,4,"Does anyone have any resources (books, podcasts, etc.) about having BPD while pregnant/raising children? Or any resources that they found particularly helpful?

I’m not planning on trying to conceive for another couple of years, but am actively thinking about how pregnancy and the early stages of child rearing will affect me. I’m planning on going through DBT skills again in the 6 months leading up to trying for a baby since I’ll have to get off of my meds and worry about a resurgence of some symptoms along with normal mood swings from hormones.

As it currently stands, my BPD is largely under control. I graduated from skills group nearly 5 years ago and take a mood stabilizer. There have been some ups and downs requiring me to return to therapy and I was recently prescribed another medication that I may or may not start taking (psychiatrist is leaving it up to me, which I appreciate), but overwhelmingly I manage my symptoms effectively when they pop up and have great interpersonal relationships with many people."
Tired of feeling like the bad guy for having boundaries,2,mk2t7l,2,"My friends are currently all pissed at me for threatening to cut them off if they talk shit about me. They’re denying they aren’t shit talking me but I don’t believe them. They’re offended I don’t trust them. 

Why do people get so fucking offended if you don’t trust them? I don’t trust anyone! I don’t mean to sound like a 14 year old off tumblr but I probably trust my mom and that’s it. This is proving to me I shouldn’t trust you cause you’re calling ME the bad person for asking you to not crap talk me? 

Nobody gives a shit about people with BPD. My friends usually don’t see this side of me but I am splitting really hard right now and I feel like I hate all of them. I could just block them all right now but i’m trying to hold off. They act like they care but they don’t know the real me. They’ve already shown me they don’t like the real me considering how pissed they are after I had a BPD outburst for the first time. 

My friend even told me he thought my therapist was wrong the first time I told him i’m borderline. That’s how much I hide it usually. For this very reason. And now I’m going to be the one completely at blame for having emotions. 

I’m fucking pissed and tired of having to apologize for other people triggering me. If you didn’t trigger me I wouldn’t have said I want to cut you off. I told them many times without lashing out that I was hurt by the situation that’s been going on. I’m so frustrated. 

Also advice is welcome."
Major insecurity in close friendships,1,mk2q4c,0,"Hi all, my first time posting here despite being a frequent viewer of the posts. I’ve never thought my situation was that bad that I’d have nowhere else to go but now is the moment where I feel like I can’t speak to any of my irls without damaging our friendship or their opinion of me. 

The situation has been something that’s bugging me for a while and I feel is completely irrational but the more it happens the less irrational my frustration at it becomes: I have a friend (we will call him Bobby/Robert) and since I’ve first met him I’ve always called him Bobby. He told me that he hates being called his full name and he asks everyone to call him Bobby. However that isn’t looking like the case, when I’ve met his other friends they’ve all called him Robert, his family calls him Robert, his colleagues call him Robert. It feels like the only person saying Bobby is me and I feel so stupid for it. It’s causing a major problem in our friendship to the point whenever we have a conversation where the subject of his full name comes up, I will get so distraught about the situation and we end up not talking for a few days because of my outburst. I just feel like I am being singled out and that Bobby does not view me as a friend because he will not accept my calling him Robert despite letting virtually everyone else in his life do it. 

Am I being totally unreasonably insecure and irrational about this or is the Bobby situation actually a little suspicious? Has anyone else had a situation where they are told that they can’t do something that everybody else seems to get away with doing? How can I deal with this in a way that doesn’t make Bobby freak out ?"
How can you get into a relationship?,1,mk2oeo,0,"I can't imagine myself getting into a relationship even though I really want one.
I've only had sexual relationships because I seek out emotionally unavailable guys. I really want a partner to love me for who I am but because I hate myself, when a man takes me seriously I don't believe him and run away.
I have a fwb right now who's starting to show me affection and I think I can imagine him being my boyfriend but he doesn't know I have bpd. I'm pretty sure he would take back everything and run away if he finds it out. 
I'm going to therapy but I just wanted to ask:

How do you cope with being frightened to lose your partner? How can you get into a relationship feeling like that? 

(btw sorry if I'm confusing, English is not my first language)"
My FP is someone I had sex with one time who doesn’t care about me,3,mk2nff,4,"CW: sexual assault, suicide, self-harm

Basically over the past month I had to realize I got seriously sexually assaulted 4 times in my life already. 

The ONLY guy that has ever asked me for consent is my ex roommate who I had sex with ONCE. After this, eventhought some flirting happened beforehand,  he made it very clear he didn’t want more. It STINGS because the gremlin in my mind latched onto him like a baby monkey. 

For weeks after, I would obsess over every convo we had. I had nightmares of him killing or abandoning me or comitting suicide himself. Besides my “casual” nightmares about SA.

I nearly committed suicide over this guy. Multiple times. Because I had sex with hime, once.

When I FINALLY moved out, I was so relieved and it eased my mind SO much not to be around him anymore. Dealing with the shame of his rejection AND the SA traumas I was going through. The sheer panic I had everytime I had to go home to my parents and leave this guy.... Eventhough “being with him” meant sitting on the other side of the wall and maybe talking once or twice a day.

The other day I saw him again and for some reason my mind can not stop thinking about him, thinking we have some kind of connection. “That it must be something”. I told him about the SA and that its hard for me to be in my old house, and he said he felt sorry for me so “tHaT mUst meAn soMeThiNg riGht”.

And now I am home and life feels painful and useless because I can not be with him. And I feel like a loser because I am even thinking of being with him, eventhough I know rationally I dont want to. The chemical imbalance in my brain just makes me think I need this guy or I will pass away and it’s embarassing and it....

Hurts."
seeking a better understanding of anxious-avoidant attachment style in males w bpd,3,mk2k2q,1,"I (22F) have BPD & an anxious-insecure attachment style. I'm looking to understand more from the perspective of a male who has both BPD and an anxious-avoidant attachment style.  I'm hoping a better understanding can help me understand the distance/avoidance better to be able to give the proper support to someone I care a lot about. The questions I mainly have are like what goes through your mind during distance? Is the person you're splitting on on your mind at all? Is there anything they can do during that time? Is it painful for you during that time? If it is painful is there anything your loved one, friend, so, whatever it is can do for you in that time while you're blocking them out? even any reading recommendations on how you came to understand your own avoidant attachment style a loved one could read and understand a little better? i really want to be able to give this person love & support. insight appreciated"

Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from their memories?,12,mk1r97,7,"I’m kind of new to the whole thing so it might be a super obvious BPD thing but does anyone feel completely disconnected from their memories?
Whenever I move to a new place (which happens quite often) or something else major in my life changes, a relationship or whatever, I completely close the chapter in my head and I whatever memory I have before that time just feels like it wasn’t me. 
I can remember what I did and what happened and how I felt but it feels like someone else’s memory, if that makes sense. At this point in time, memories up to last summer feel ‘real’ and mine but anything before that feels like someone else’s memories that somehow appeared in my head."
Insomnia ramps up all my mental health problems by 50,28,mk1p6r,8,"I'm so fucking sick of this. Why is it that when I'm already struggling my body decides it isn't enough that I'm stressed I should also be rendered unable to sleep?

My partner's past is driving me crazy.,1,mk15q1,5,"I feel like its been nonstop panic. We met 2 years before seeing each other again, they stopped talking to me to get back with their ex. They moved away and broke up with that person for another. Then broke up and had a wild 6 months and saw a lot of people. They lied about the number, who they slept with, and what happened right before we started dating, up to a couple of days in fact.  

Told me they didn't sleep with people that they did sleep with, on multiple different occasions. the worst part was lying about their body count, they told me it was 8 which is much higher than they had led me to believe since i was number 3 when we first met (i lost my virginity that time, and only slept with one other person). then 2 years later said ""i lied it's actually 12"" because ""I specifically remember counting with my friend"" then went back to ""i must have counted wrong it was 8"" I found all this out because I was stalking their profile and their past and everything.I was told so many times ""there's nothing else"" or being blamed for being upset. all, in the end, to find out i was right and they were lying.

I feel completely irrational but I cant stop obsessing over it. ""who else was there"" what else aren't they telling me. we've been together for 7 years and i don't see a world with my partner. but I constantly obsess over these thoughts and it is driving me crazy. we talk about it but it never helps. I want to just have full trust again but it's so hard to do that and feels like i may never get there. Im so scared that ill never be able to let go of this shit.  don't want that, I want it to be better. 

Sorry for the long rant. I just wanted to get all of this out. Please don't tell me I'm being irrational because rational is not really a word I work well with.

any advice helps. thank you."

I don't feel like anything can take away the fear of abandonment, chronic emptiness and all the behaviours and thinking patterns associated with BPD.

DAE wonder if they’ll be able to accomplish what they want out of life?,3,mk04yl,2,"I have been feeling that lately this disorder will cause me to be unable to do the things I want in life.
The other day my friend was telling me how he wants to become rich and how determined he is to make that happen... and see I would love that and I want that but anytime I start to look into the process and understanding where to start I get incredibly overwhelmed and then ultimately give up, telling myself I’ll never be able to do it.

I can barely keep a job or attend school without extra help, and on top of that the things I want to do in my future change constantly and I never know where I want to end up. I want things to be easy and just get rich without having to do any of the work, which I know sounds impractical but I get so overwhelmed at all of the “real world” stuff there is for me to learn after I graduate. 

I try to remind myself that there is nothing I can’t do and that the world can be anything I want it to be, but it feels like this disorder holds me back from so much and I don’t know how I will ever make a happy, wealthy living and life for myself because of it. Does anyone ever feel this way?"
Any experience with accutane?,1,mjzd7n,1,"I was aware of many potential side effects going into starting accutane 3 weeks ago, but figured they’d be mostly physical and not mental. Sure as shit, with my amazing luck and neurochemistry, my thoughts of self harm and suicide have boosted to a degree that I’m not sure I can ignore. I hate it because it’s already working so well on my acne, which makes me feel terrible. 

I’ve read studies regarding a 20% reduction in brain activity in a cortex which is correlated to depression when activity is lower. Wondering if that means for us borderlines who are not clinically depressed, if perhaps our depressive episodes become worst and the suicidal ideation is exasperated. 

What was your experience with accutane?"
BPD: Superpower or am I broken?,2,mjz6o2,8,"Yesterday, I was working my minimum wage retail job as per usual but it has been getting progressively busier each day. We were very understaffed, and I was the only one on the floor. There were so many people talking, horrible music on the radio, so many things to remember, and I felt like I couldn’t keep up with everything. I had to work the register and it was customer after customer - it never stopped. I couldn’t even catch my breath while standing still. I had to get them to sign this, give them this receipt, give them this pamphlet, maintain eye contact and good customer service, but also be able to swiftly move past each transaction. While working the register, I also had to straighten the floor, maintain fitting rooms, (remembering # of holds, # of items, # of people in line for the fitting room, etc.). I’ve never been great at math and having to juggle all of these numbers started to put me in a spiral. Bins of clothes were starting to stack up, our copies of the receipts were getting mixed up, and I kept forgetting to give them the damn pamphlet. I’m usually pretty good under pressure but this is different. I worked at Trader Joe’s for 2 1/2 years and that shit gets CRAZY during the holidays. Then again, that was 3 years ago... I’ve had a lot of substance abuse that has impacted my memory and threshold since then. Anyways, I was seeing & feeling every warning sign before a big burst. I was scared. I was in public, I was being watched, and I felt like I was set up to fail! I felt and still feel that it was humanly impossible to run that store ultimately by myself! The other two girls there (my managers) were buying inventory so they needed to stay behind the front. They kept barking at me to do this then this then “Hey can you check on ___?” and “Please open up reg” and blah, making me bounce around the entire store. I’m pretty used to that but I was the only one there to do pretty much everything!

Next thing I know, my heart is racing. My eyebrow is twitching and it’s making me want to punch myself in the face. I’m shaking so much that I keep dropping the coins when giving cash back (I even accidentally opened the nickels in the quarter slot :( sorry closers). I knew that it had reached my breaking point. Way past that point. At any minute, I could have an embarrassing dissociative breakdown in the middle of my workplace. I reached over to one of my managers that I trust dearly, the other one is a c*nt from hell, and told her that I need to talk to her when she gets a minute. 35 minutes later, I finally tell her these words: “I can’t do this. I mentally and physically cannot do this. I don’t even know if I work, I don’t know what to do, I just really can’t do this” At this point, everything was really blurred and I could hear my ears ringing. I started tearing up and shaking even worse. She said “do you need to take a minute in the back?” A MINUTE? IM SORRY? What the fuck is 60 seconds going to do for my well-being right now?????? I said “I don’t know, I just can’t” I don’t know why these were the only things coming out of my mouth but whatever ... She requested that I stay until we found a cover or wait until the next person comes on. I agreed and told her I was fine doing that and it hurt even more knowing that if I left, I would be jeopardizing them. There I go again worrying about other people more than my own well-being... I stayed and I hovered near the register because that’s the only place I felt safe TBH. I told her that because of my disorder(s) and being neuro-divergent, I get overstimulated very quickly and more than just overstimulated. She took it as me being a bit dramatic and just anxious, saying she completely understands “exactly” how I feel but going home would put too much on the store. Next thing I know, my c*nt from hell manager comes to the front after being in the back for like 15 minutes. She left when I initially told my nice manager how I was feeling. At that time, evil manager was standing about 3 feet away from us, so she’d only be able to pick pieces of what she heard. She came to the front, hung up a phone, and approached me. She said, “So basically [boss’s name] said you need to go and you’re free to clock off, she’ll send you your last check in the mail.”

I froze. Am I being fired right now?

I said, “What? What do you mean?? What happens after I clock out?” and she responded with “When you leave the building, you are unemployed.”

I demanded I talked to our boss directly and that this doesn’t make any sense and she goes “She’s at a wedding right now, Mina.” Bitch you just got off of the phone?? You had time to discuss firing me but she doesn’t have time to come to me directly? Embarrassing and unprofessional.

Now I was trying to put the pieces together here. Who in the FUCK gave you the entitlement to take matters into your own hands (btw she’s not even a manager manager, she just has a key) to call our boss about MY situation that I didn’t even talk to you about?????? She called our boss upon hearsay, assumed that I was resigning when really I was in crisis, and next thing I know, i’m told to leave my keys and leave. I couldn’t believe it. I still can’t believe it. I’ve been up all night thinking about what I did wrong and I just don’t know. I couldn’t control myself deflating. I couldn’t control the panic. I tried every coping mechanism, planned to get a bite to eat on my lunch, (WHICH!!! I should have been sent on my lunch at 1 pm and my last punch was at 12:57) They really didn’t try to accommodate at all and sent me on my way. These people who I thought were my friends and who I thought recognized my solid work ethic and devotion to the team. Yeah only 12.25 an hour but it’s the only job I can have right now! I have bills to pay and a shelter to maintain. I have to feed and be fed. This absolute raging c*nt is 19, has everything handed to her, and is swiping on tinder with no shoes on behind the counter. I busted my ass to prove to our boss that I am capable of going into management, especially with my experience of being a long term manager at my past job.

I am in shock. My brain keeps being mean and trying to find reasons for why they jumped to that conclusion. I was just starting to get trained into management and upped my hours. At home, I’ll still think about work because I worry and worry. I rethink everything that I said that day, things I could have done better, and it sometimes impacts my already struggling relationship. I feel that this is somehow a blessing in disguise since I knew how deeply dissatisfied I was.

I’m still so angry. Anger is the emotion I have the biggest difficult with. I want to go back and beat the bitch up! Not only did she do me dirty here, but she has done me dirty each and every time I’ve worked with her, including embarrassing me in front of customers/co-workers. I keep reminding myself to find zen and that it’s not worth the energy but WTF ? Do I file for unemployment, make a claim, let go and move on? Or send pounds of animal feces to her door by an anonymous sender? Idk. I just need perspective on this and feedback and... help? I guess? Idk."

I need a reality check but I don't want to ask anyone I know so I don't come off too intense,1,mjytxb,0,"I'm doing my best to like...act normal and not let other people see my anxiety but I just feel like I still need advice sometimes and idk who to ask that it won't overburden them or come off as weird or too intense.

I started hanging out regularly with a friend of mine who is very well adjusted, I like her a lot,we started taking walks weekly. I introduced her to another friend and they get along really well, which is great. But last week we all decided to take a small hike and I couldn't do it, like it kicked my ass and it was awful and embarrassing. I'm just all effed up because of depression and covid and whatever. So now I'm kinda concerned they will start hanging out without me. Like I think the normal person thing to do would be to be chill about that and be like ""yeah cool sure catch you next time"" or something. But I am super paranoid they are gonna abandon me and I'm trying not to be weird or let that show but I have the weird goth 90s kid thing where instead of being ok or just totally blabbering about how I'm afraid they're gonna leave me, I just kinda vaguely make funny jokes and pretend I'm fine. 

Like...I think I'm overreacting and being afraid that they will stop hanging out with me because I'm a burden or out of shape or whatever ...but it also just feels really inevitable that everyone will leave me because I suck. That always happens. People always leave. I get along with friends one on one but then when I introduced them they either hate each other or get along so well I get cut out of the picture because it becomes so obvious how much of a weirdo I am. 

What do. If I say anything, it's going to come across as insane ranting, but if I say nothing I know they will just feel my anxious vibe and I'm gonna be paranoid. If I avoid them, it's a self fulfilling prophecy. If I was emotionally stable I could take control of the social interactions by suggesting outings or somehow being more competent, but I'm just not dude. I'm a broken ass toy trying to pretend not to be. Gehhhhhh...."

I had been looking forward to this especially since it was going to be a combined belated birthday/end of passover dinner thing. I had already been having a very bad week to begin with and this was just icing on the cake. I kind of just had a breakdown. I don't really know what I was trying to accomplish with this, but I got to the point where I ended up taking a handful of excedrin (probably around like 15) BECAUSE I knew it wasn't enough to really do anything other than make me feel sick. For a long time now I've kind of just been in the belief of ""oh I'm fine on my own. I don't need help."" And I mean I know that along with other things I was doing last night was not okay, but I just can't bring myself to care. I'm not currently seeing any sort of professional, and I just turned 26 so I lost my insurance, but was having issues with insurance applications so I couldn't get any coverage for April, so even if I wanted to I can't really do anything about it until May 1st at the earliest."

I shouldn't have been saved. I keep reaching out to her, so long after what's happened. I try hard not to, I often go several months without doing it, then one day, the pain becomes too much and I ask her to try and reconnect.

It's so hard. I am such a fuck up. I've never had someone treat me so well, yet I treated her so poorly and would scare her with my anger due to way back when I bullied her.

I bullied, I apologized, we became friends, now we aren't because I got too clingy.

This post goes toward any kind of relationship, not just romantic. I have trouble connecting with almost everyone. 
I just got into a relationship and I already find myself second guessing. I feel like I’ve lost interest in him solely because I can’t stand to let myself admit that someone enjoys my presence. I want to isolate myself from him and everything else. I feel like it would be so much easier if I just didn’t have to deal with human interaction most of the time, but I also have this intense feeling of wanting to be wanted. I care about the guy a lot, I wait for his messages and I ask him about his day... but I feel annoyed when he asks me how I am or what I want to do. For some reason I just have trouble trying to admit that he likes me even though he drives out to see me and hangs out with me for hours."
"I'm so, so scared",9,mjxtzm,8,"CW: sex, past abuse, rape, trivial issue

I used to be hypersexual. Mostly because I was starved for affection and you kind of take any show of affection you can in that situation.

I got easily manipulated and sweet talked into sexual favours. And then always felt like shit after. I did anything anyone wanted me to. I was underage at the time and doing shit with older guys.

I'm 19 now. Six months ago, I was raped. I've been sexually abused before but this was the textbook definition.

The sight of my naked body disgusted me after that. I became completely asexual. I've recovered since then.

I met this guy, from my other account, on Reddit. He seemed (seems) sweet, attentive and understanding. He didn't push me to have cam sex. He just said he liked my body and other stuff. Why the fuck then did I say all the right things to seduce him, helped him get his rocks off and pretend to have an orgasm?

He said he was tired after and would text me later. That's completely understandable. Inside my head however, I gave him sex, he's supposed to show me affection.

Like an idiot, I asked him if he would talk to me later, 'have an ordinary conversation'. And he said, yeah, for sure.

I'm attached. I'm an idiot. I feel so stupid and angry and I'm crying.

As I was typing this, he messaged me asking if I wanted to go for a second round later tonight. I said, 'maybe'.

FUCK. Why do I feel so heartbroken. How do I deal with this in a healthy, normal person way?"
Not being able to talk to your FP about your feelings towards them because they couldnt possibly understand how much of an impact they have on you,15,mjxr99,5,"This is one of the worst things about a FP.

I sent a text saying ""happy easter"" to my FP a few hours ago (we only text or call nowadays because they moved pretty far away recently). Figured it would be too much to call since its just easter so i texted. They read my text and didnt even bother to respond.

Normally id be like ""whatever"", but this is my *FP*. And its not just some poor bastard that i started obsessing over that doesnt want to have anything to do with me. Its a person that until not very long ago i was very close to and that used to genuinely like me very much. Now i cant even get a lousy ""happy easter to you too!"" back.

This isnt the only thing anyway. The times ive tried and failed to make conversation in the last while all went pretty much the same way. But im also not being ghosted, because sometimes they text me some basic bs and we talk for a bit. But its just not the same energy like back in the day anymore.

The ""happy easter"" text broke the camel's back. And i want to just tell them what a shitty friend they are and cut them off completely and generally just start shit about it.

But i cant. Because this is just a person that didnt respond to a text. They cant possibly understand the way im feeling, its just not normal to them. How am i supposed to rage at them about this? I cant.

This is literally the worst thing about having a FP. Their words or actions can cause you the most intense pain, anger and sadness but if you called them out theyd think youre crazy and insane. Which lets be honest...."
Quiet bpd with a shitty family,1,mjxk0x,3,"So I'm 19 and live at home with my mother and 29 yo sister, they both posses a plethora of narcissistic traits that over time has led me to go low contact/no contact with both of them but because I still live at home it's practically impossible to go anywhere in the house without either one of them breaking this boundary I set using a hoovering tactic or scapegoating/blameshifting which only makes me feel worse about who I am and how I feel about how they treat me. I'm not too strapped for cash for food so I don't rely on them for groceries but until I have enough money to leave I'm constantly stuck in this constant inner turmoil of ""do I engage in this frivolous confrontation for the false sense of hope that my family actually cares about me, or do I ignore the invites for ""open"" discussion and allow myself to be berated even more than I already am simply for standing up for myself.""
It constantly feels like I'm making the wrong decisions but I know I can't go back to a family that abuses me then resents me when I speak up about said abuse, it feels like I'm losing my mind. It's like when I speak up about how I feel in accordance to the way they treat me, they no longer understand English. All in all there's nothing I can do so I'm just gonna sit here for as long as it plays out but it's been like this for maybe 2 years now lmao"
My coworker now knows I'm a total bdsm masochist whore...,50,mjx9bf,16,"Apparently between my plushie collecting and cute compliments and anxious demeaner he Apparently considered me completely innocent 

Well that went out the window when things got hot and heavy between us 

....what he doesn't know is that it's an entire act I put on to appear interesting and desirable and in reality I crave actual love making when they hold me and call me by my name not ""fucking slut"" or ""dirty bitch"" but I'm also terrified of intimacy and feel like my only place in this world is as a fuck toy 

Anyway he never spoke to me again after that night so who cares 🙃🙃🙃 (I fucking hate myself)"
I’m trying to make a new friend,5,mjwv1j,4,"For as long as I can remember I have been struggling with having more than one relationship. Me and my boyfriend, my FP, have been in a relationship for two years and it’s been great but I’m so attached to our and only our relationship. 
But yesterday I challenged myself, I have this girl at work and we really get along. Conversations are never strained it just flows and I feel that she’s actually interesting. So I sent her a text suggesting we’ll hang out some time outside of work. She responded that she’ll be delighted and that I am a super nice person to be around. We also added each other on snap chat and I feel I somewhat made a new friend. Something that most of the times feels impossible to me. 

But fuck that, I challenged myself and I had a great outcome, I will continue to challenge myself and that horrid voice in my head that tells me I’m not worth shit."
DAE still live with their abusive parents because they can’t afford to move out?,5,mjwk3l,0,"I have been emotionally abused my entire life by my very own parents and I dread living with them every single day. I just can’t afford to move out, which is the problem here. I rather live anywhere than here. I would live with my grandparents if I could but they don’t have room."
bpd relationship with the love of my life,1,mjwgwz,2,"i met my lover a year and a half ago but we know our love is unlike any other. We’re now 19/20 but we promised each other unconditional love for life, and we have a special bond that is truly magic. Earlier this year around 7 months ago he struggled mentally a lot and a cycle of pushing me away / hurting my feelings started on a regular basis - but I learnt then that Love encapsulates everything about somebody else all the ups and the downs and that I would sacrifice certain things happily for this love to exist. To sum it up quickly I know he has a history of childhood trauma, led him to rely only on himself and cut off everyone else very easily if ever disappointed + went on antidepressants for a bit after getting diagnosed with clinical depression earlier in his teens, and now I was the only one with his family to be unconditionally loving and caring for him. I love him so extraordinarily much, and I know he does too, he warned me that when he pushes me away so violently i should know it’s not him. 
So i want to fight for this Love, for him by any means.
He broke up with me last week by falsely accusing me of cheating, saying he wants me to hate him, and ever since blocked me from all ways of communicating with him, unfollowed me from everywhere, in sum he erased me from his present life. I truly believe our Love is meant to be, and although it’ll be difficult we can overcome it if I get him to see a therapist. It’s always hard to talk about his mental health - let alone now that he sees me as his enemy and never wants to see me again.. i’ve told him i really am hurting / self harming and he has been completely indifferent, ghosting me. It’s extra tough on me but it’s nothing compared to what I believe the pain he is now. We never talked about bpd/ he never got diagnosed but i read into it this year and it fits perfectly who he has been.
We have been in long distance alternatively for almost a year since Corona now and we will keep on being it next year, which justifies why he gave up on all these efforts.  I don’t want to give up on him so I booked a train to see him next week and although I’m pretty sure he is gonna refuse to see me and I’ll go back home without having seen him, I need to show him I truly love him...

Anyways this realization that the love of my life is pathologically pushing me away and making it so hard is really fucking me up unlike anything I’ve ever lived in my Life. 
I really need help from people who have positive experiences of bpd relationships because I know on my life God put us together for a reason..."
Interested to hear from anyone (especially women) wirh co morbidity of ADD or ADHD,5,mjwcvx,6,"Hi everyone. Hope you are all doing as well as possible. I had an epiphany recently. My beautiful, vibrant and wonderful daughter has been partially diagnosed as having ADD. We are still going through the process of getting a full diagnosis but I am almost sure after doing my own digging, that yes she does present with most of the prerequisites for such a diagnosis. Interestingly enough, it seems that a lot of what she is experiencing was what I went through as a kid and I feel like I might have been living with ADD my whole freaking life without knowing. 
Obviously, my intention is for my daughter to get all the help she needs. She is super intelligent and I am so tired of hearing that if she were to stop being a dreamer and just focus... Blah blah. She isn't slow or stupid or unfocused or unmotivated, she is quiet (too quiet), shw has liw self esteem and is always down on herself for not being clever enough or extroverted or good enough ( all of which I know to be untrue) and it kills me that she feels alm this negativity toward herself. 
I feel like maybe, presenting with the same 'symptoms' as her as her, there would be some info regarding BPD and ADD co morbidity. There is a lot of info out there regarding co morbid symptoms but not a heck of a lot re adult females with BPD and ADD. If anyone could point me in the right direction or share their own experiences, I would be very grateful. 
Thanks in advance xx"
Am I out of some kind of loop?,12,mjw94f,6,Why is everyone around me getting closer to each other and further and further from me? What is it about me that makes people just leave me out. Every time I predict something like this is going happen it does. I’m so sick of being right about people and yet so sad about being lonely. I want to be in the loop I want to belong but I can’t seem to make a real human connection to anyone. I’m literally important to no one. I am the connector. I bring people together and they leave me behind. My whole life will be spent like this. I’ll never belong or be loved.
"The lack of utility in the term ""Borderline Personality Disorder""",1,mjw93m,2,"There seems to be an emotional disconnection between what I feel and what I think of as ""BPD."" Saying ""I have BPD"" or that I suffer from it aren't guttural statements that I know to be true as I'm saying them. It's like saying a triangle has 3 sides, it's just kinda true because we agree that it's true.  


I think the terms BPD and Borderline Personality Disorder take away something as they attempt to describe sufferers and the condition. To me, BPD is a very vacuous and empty term and there will not be a guttural punch to it because it was designed clinically and not ""for humans in the real world"", for lack of a better term.  


Before our modern era, (some or most) people didn't use to think of the world conceptually as a place of things. They used to think of it as a place of action or meaning. The world would consist of that which you could interact with and what effect it would have on your life. (Maybe a reason as to why people were more easily religious, as religion could be seen as having an effect on their life and thus more real?) To think of a BPD sufferer existing in an era like this, I would think that these people would have described it differently. They might've said that a sufferer had gone through certain trials/tribulations or had been lacking something in their early life and thus now is affected by this experience. To me, this is a more useful (at least in my day to day) way of thinking about BPD. A series of cause and effect, essentially. For me and my head, it can be hard to fit how my personality has been morphed, how my ""traumas"" have formed my fears and strengths, and how these affect my moment to moment thinking into... ""BPD."" It seems much easier to imagine that because I had a toxic, selfish family environment without a positive male influence and thoroughly negative feminine personalities instead, that I turned out like I did. This leads to this which leads to this and ends up here.  


Besides being the thousandth thought experiment I've run today, I believe this could be a more helpful way of viewing the disorder since when I think of BPD purely clinically and as DBT as purely ""the thing I should say/do"", it all sorta loses it's kick whereas my emotions get that extra persuasive edge of being closer to the human experience than something like the terms of ""BPD"" or ""DBT."" And while I understand that we shouldn't lower everything to the base level of emotions as people who suffer from an emotional disregulatory disorder, I don't think that means we have to act as if emotions themselves are simply a phantom phenomenon. Humans do exist on a level of reality where things have meaning and if they mean nothing, then they are worth nothing. Even if more modern minds wish to be purely objective, rational, and detached."
DAE sob over people you barely know? I went from being extremely happy to being scared of abandonment.,18,mjw2ko,1,"Well I had a positive social interaction today and for once I felt happy/content. This was followed by a short period of hyperactivity. I was basically running around my house and rapidly speaking while telling my sibling about the people I had met. I felt so incredibly grateful for them, they were inspiring and made me happy and grateful to be alive. So much so, to the point where I wanted to cry because I felt so happy. But at the same time, a part of me felt unworthy of their love. I tried to suppress the tears and now 5 hrs later I am sobbing because I'm scared that they're going to leave me and I'm not going to be happy/supported anymore. My brain has even made up scenarios where they are getting hurt/dying and I'm being abandoned. I know this sounds crazy :(."
Can’t stop ruminating,6,mjvw3b,0,"A bit of background: So uncontrollable anger is not normally a symptom of my BPD. If any trace of anger wells up in me, I break down into tears instead. So the last couple years I’ve been working on feeling anger and uncovering repressed anger. It’s been a slow process, and a little bit on hiatus while I go through a pretty persistent depressive episode. 

Anyways. Something happened at work where I ended up in a yelling match. This person and I have never gotten along, but we’ve never yelled like that, and it was about something so trivial. It’s kind of a blur in my memory. I remember thinking to myself, “I’m not gonna back down, I’m gonna stand up for myself here.” Because I have a history of not being able to stand up for myself and in this situation I knew I wasn’t being unreasonable. But somehow it devolved wildly into a totally uncontrolled yelling match. I kept trying to bring it back around to grounded discussion but it was just impossible. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve raised my voice at another person! 

So I left thinking I wanted to quit my job and everything was falling apart. I’m not used to feeling anger so it felt like the end of the world. I thought about how I’ve worked on expressing anger in therapy, and wished I had the props my therapist uses - a big foam block and a foam bat to hit the block with. In lieu of that I grabbed my ax and went into my backyard and chopped the fuck out of an old dead stump. I tried to give voice to my anger like how my therapist would guide me through the process if they would have been there. Then I went inside and cried. 

At first I felt really good about my efforts to feel and release my emotions in a healthy and intentional way. I guess I’m still proud of trying to use skills I’ve learned in therapy. But. I can’t stop ruminating. It’s been three days and every night I just loop through what happened. I can’t stop feeling ashamed for the things I said that were not emotionally intelligent in the heat of the moment. I can’t stop thinking about how I want that person to suffer, or how I feel bad for them because their life must be so miserable to behave like that. I think about facing them again and what I’ll say or not say. I think about how I can’t deal with this and it’s a reflection of everything else I can’t deal with and I should quit my job and run away. 

I hate that this person has taken up residence in my brain. They are not worth any more of my energy. 

I don’t see my therapist again for another four days and we have other important shit to talk about! I don’t even want to have to feel the need to bring this up in therapy at all! It’s so stupid! I just want to stop thinking about it. Howwwwwwwww"
Did anyone else’s parents reject their diagnosis?,97,mjvo5i,49,"I got diagnosed by two different psychiatrists and they were definitely right. I’m reasonably close with my parents but 80% of what goes on in my head and life they don’t know about. When I told them about the diagnosis (to each individually, they’re split up) they basically rejected it and claimed it wasn’t true. Did anyone else experience this? How did you deal with it?"
how to deal with recovery plateaus? (TW suicide/self harm),3,mjvlqw,3,"trigger warning: mentions of suicide & send harm.

context: i was diagnosed with bpd in 2015. i started dbt (group + individual) in september 2019, stopped in march 2020 due to being laid off both my jobs. restarted with the same therapist in january of 2021, gonna start group here soon as well. 

the past month has been brutal emotionally. i went to the hospital two weeks ago after relapsing with self harm and suicidal ideation. i’ve just been a mess. 

i feel like i’m hitting a plateau with my progress. i feel like i’m barely surviving right now, and i’m frustrated with that. have any of you guys experienced this, and what did you do to push through it?

much love xoxoxo"
I’m sorry to all those I’ve hurt in ways that were hurtful and were damaging-,323,mjvcs4,30,"I was unaware that I was mindlessly reacting to my impulses and insecurities that I projected towards you & all of you. 

They say “Hurt people hurt people,” and I can’t believe I became that hurtful person that hurt you. All I wanted was for you to love me.

But I didn’t know the myths and assumptions I had about your lack of love was just my insecurities and lack of self-love.

I now know that you truly cared and loved.. but you didn’t know how to care for someone that had BPD and someone who was so lost and stuck in a dark place. 

I’m trying to move on and I’m trying my best not to project unto others my inabilities to self-regulate; self-soothe and self-love. 

I’m trying to be more effective in asking for support and help that doesn’t cross boundaries.

I’m still lost and afraid yet this adult that feels like a child navigating this world is owning up to her past wrongs. 

I reflect on our good memories & I radically accept this moment even though it isn’t what I want it to be.

I ask for your forgiveness even though you might never talk to me again- but I wish more importantly your happiness because you deserve everything good in this world. 

I’m sorry. I really am. 

And thank you for what was once.

Dear me,

Set yourself free. 
Love yourself because it’s time to take care of yourself- the way you wished others would :’)

Be the best friend you never had.
It is never too late.

Love has lost meaning for me,5,mjv08g,10,"Like..when someone says ""I love you"" I just..don't feel it. It feels like just words. Deep inside I kinda just think to myself, ""Yeah sure you do."" sarcastically but I'll say it back and mean it with all my heart.

I do love others. I love others..way more than myself. Not to say I don't love myself. It's about a 50/50. Like I know I'm generally a good person, with talent, and I'm a hard worker and a really good friend, but..ever since my ex left me last year. I just..really can't find it in me to believe when someone says they love me anymore


Once again. It's just words out someone's mouth. It holds no weight to me. I acknowledge that they do, but the question then is ""for how long"". 

Another thing. I genuinely cannot find deep attraction in others ever since my ex. Like..I've slept with 5 different women since she left..I don't feel any spark. There's nothing that jumps out and makes me crush on anyone. It's like I want all the shit of a relationship, but without any of the titles or attachment. Like yes please cuddle me, kiss me, love on me, let me love on you, let's fuck, but..I never fall in love. I never get a crush. No one jumps out to me like my ex did. Like come on a stoner metalhead with childhood trauma isn't exactly hard to come across, but..my ex is the only stoner metalhead chick with childhood trauma that I want. I don't care to learn about anybody else. I don't care to get close like that to anyone else. I don't care to share my favorite color with someone. I don't want anyone relationship wise..aside from my ex (big shit show story behind her and I). Like I spend so much time honestly lonely and deprived of intimacy that it's all I crave, and whilst I'll happily take it from anybody, I also don't want to commit to anybody.


Like how tf does someone say ""Be my girlfriend without being my girlfriend.""? Like..treat me like a boyfriend (cuddles, kisses, hanging out, fucking, let's have pet names and shit, make cute memories) but you can just do whatever tf you want cause I can't commit."
It all makes so much sense,3,mjv01g,1,"I’m a 25 y/o make, For the second time in my life I have ruined a great relationship with a great love of my life. I’ve learned that this person would be called my “Favorite Person”. I’ve been wondering what was “wrong” with me because it always feels like I try so hard but it’s never enough, and when I lose control, or I think “split” is the correct terms, I get very violent. I never hurt people physically, always walls and tv’s and objects, I destroy things. I feel trapped in my own body, cognizant but not in control. I’ve been reading on BPD, and it all fits. It makes me feel so good to know I’m not the only one who is like this. It feels so good to have a name. I’m not diagnosed, but I’m going to talk to my therapist Saturday about it. Any advice about how to bring it up to my therapist? Or any advice at all?"
I feel like I can never get a job because of my BPD,41,mjuxrc,9,"In 2017 I got fired from my first and only job. A coworker had been bullying me for months and nobody was taking it seriously. My boss said I was being histrionic and making things up. The other people I worked with deflected because they didn't want to get caught up in drama or pretended they knew nothing. I tried to file a complaint but they said unless he was sexually harassing me, they had no case. One day he made a joke about my grandpa who had just passed away and I just snapped, I had a very public meltdown. My boss was furious, she kind of got physical with me by grabbing me by the collar, which choked me, and dragging me into another room. She called me pathetic, an embarrassment, and that some clients had seen me and were disgusted. I had tarnished our company's reputation and potentially lost them tens of thousands of dollars.

After that I spent 6 months in the psych ward, trying to gather all the broken pieces of myself and put them back together. I was already a shy and awkward person prior to the incident, but this just crippled me. I have good people skills and a strong sense of empathy, but none of that matters if I get paralyzed with fear when I'm around anyone other than my close family and friends. If somebody I don't know well gets within my proximity, I panic - I feel nauseous, lightheaded, my limbs feel numb, flight response. I'm paranoid and afraid that they'll abuse or attack me. It's irrational, but my brain paints almost everyone as being a potential threat.

For the past couple years, I've been trying to find an entry-level job where I don't have to be around others or talk to anyone. I refuse to let something like what happened 4 years ago happen ever again. I know it's black-and-white thinking, but I'm adamant. I haven't had much luck because most of them require skills I lack, like having a good memory or being accurate and efficient. I'm not really interested in or good at anything, when I have a FP I will force myself to like specific things because I want to try and impress them, but I have no FP at the moment so I have no interests. I'm stuck in this uneasy situation and it makes me miserable."
Advice on dealing with/getting over obsessive crushes?,2,mjujrs,2,"i’ve only ever had a few in person crushes and that is purely because as soon as i attach myself to that person, the feelings don’t seem to go away. they last for a solid few years or until it gets to where i’m not seeing them often (like changing schools and not seeing them in class anymore). 

over covid time though, this changed. instead of attaching myself to one person, as soon as i felt any romantic feelings for someone, it was an instant ghosting and ignoring of any messages from them. i basically pretended they didn’t exist. it wasn’t healthy but it worked, yet now that i’m back in college, being faced with romantic feelings for someone is hitting me so much harder and i honestly feel like i’m going crazy.

there’s this guy in my law class and although i act completely normal around him, i feel myself almost obsessing? i don’t stalk his accounts or anything, more i’m constantly thinking about him. my mood drastically changes depending on how i think he views me. right now i feel so anxious and genuinely hate myself purely because i’ve convinced myself he was only pretending to like me. i feel like i’m going through hell and don’t know what to do. i’ve become friends with this guy and don’t want to end up hating him or pretending he doesn’t exist because i’m convinced he hates me or think it will save me from getting hurt. i’ve also already started having some intrusive thoughts about him and i’m scared they’re going to escalate. 

does anyone else have advice on dealing with this sort of stuff? like how to get over crushes or cope with them in a way that doesn’t make them feel like they’re controlling my life?

edit: i don’t want a relationship right now, i’m genuinely not in the right headspace for one so admitting any feelings seems unfair to the guy."
The expectations of normal life are crushing me,48,mjtpww,6,"I’m a full time student and part time retail worker and I just am drowning in it. The expectations of my professors, my boss, and my parents exhaust me and I don’t think I can put up with it anymore. No one understands the struggle I go through every day with masking all my emotions, the disassociation, the chronic emptiness or the lack of motivation from being depressed. Like getting motivation to get out of bed for school or work or even simply getting out of bed to go eat or shower has become a chore. I’m so low atm I don’t get how ppl push on. I constantly have something on my to do list and it’s leaves me completely unable to relax and enjoy life. And now I’m stuck in a like burned out state pushing my self farther and farther into a deep depressive state. But this is just normal life expectations that everyone puts up with and that kills me inside that I can’t even to the like bare minimum without feeling completely overwhelmed and exhausted."
"Does splitting/devaluing always come as conscious thoughts about disliking the person, or do you sometimes just get really anxious/paranoid about someone?",1,mjszuq,1,"I don't know if the title makes sense, let me try to explain. 

Part of why I wasn't sure if I have BPD before is because I wasn't sure I related to the whole devaluing thing... like I don't feel like I suddenly have thoughts that I dislike someone I was liking a lot before and push them away. But I do notice that sometimes in the past, with someone who I'm possibly idealizing or feeling too attached to, I'll kind of push them away out of fear in one form or another. It's not even just the ""I feel like they'll leave so I'm going to push them away"" (at least not consciously) that I hear about with BPD. Instead it's getting anxious or even paranoid about them, suddenly feeling like they don't have good intentions and are almost dangerous, interpreting talks more negatively (I'll swear they're judging me or think they're being hurtful). Maybe these are just times when I actually became aware of someone being bad vibes, I don't know, but it feels like it might be more than that.

I do also somewhat split or devalue, but I never felt like it was ""extreme"" enough to be BPD. And it wasn't in the context of romantic relationships (since I've avoided those most of my life). It'd be getting annoyed at family members and suddenly feeling distant and less loving toward my family (still loving them, just not feeling it at the moment), wishing I could start a new life and be away from them (but then again there was conflict in the house, so who knows). Or I'd secretly think bitter negative thoughts about friends, like suddenly looking at this friend and seeing her as so fake. I thought of it as just kind of a bitchy bitter cynicism coming from my unhappiness, which I wished I didn't have but couldn't help."
It’s been a long time,2,mjswq1,0,"My bpd has been really out of control and my impulsiveness been making me do or think about things I wouldn’t normally consider.

I used to self harm when I was younger and the last time I have done it was in 2017. Lately I have been so confused with how I feel to the point of feeling like my bpd is winning.. 

I recently bought myself a semi colon necklace to remind myself of how far I came with my mental health but my mind kept pushing me to do it almost as if I “missed” the feeling of doing it even though I felt the fear of thinking about it.. but it has convinced me so good that after 4 years of not doing it, today I have self harmed myself..

I am so sorry.."
Does anyone else genuinely hate themselves?,26,mjs74c,31,"I'm in general a pretty positive person, if someone has problems in trying to help the best I can and even if someone's acting like an ass I can defuse the situation or talk him out of that state.
However, I lately realized I don't feel the same way about me at all. There are of course people I don't get along with, people I wouldn't wanna speak with even if I get threatened with violence but the only time i feel so much genuine hate inside of me is whenever I'm picturing myself in front of me. It's one of the single strongest feelings I've ever felt and by times even crippling.
Anyone else got that problem and if so does any one of you have advice on how to deal with it?
Edit: grammar"
abandonment complex vs. actual abandonment,6,mjrwns,1,"i feel like my fp has fallen out of love with me.

normally i convince myself that people are leaving me, and i work to convince myself that someone would never stay. i avoid feeling alone by never letting myself rely one someone's company. 

but in this case i am worried that i am convincing myself to stay with someone. that the signs are there, and i am avoiding alone-ness by keeping someone's company when really it would be healthier to not rely on them, emotionally.

i am so disregulated. i offer people prizes to love me and when i stop giving the prizes and expect me to be enough, they stop seeing the shimmer of it and i am the asshole for not being what was advertised. 

what? emotionally vulnerable? i hate hearing ""this isn't what i signed up for."" so i have to be the standard? not even me - but me being desirable? 

how do i know? it stops feeling real after a while."
First love and I hate it,0,mjrla7,3,"Sup I am 16yo and recently got hospitalized for severe depressions, as it turns out it is borderline anyways atm I am still hospitalized and just found my first love. 


She also 16 also has BPD, she is the most beautiful and impressive girl I have ever seen, we talked for hours and flirted for hours and it was going perfect. 


Then I told her about my feelings and she replied that she felt the same but after that we stopped talking. 

I now have my first girlfriend and we aren’t even talking I am spamming her whatsapp in my episodes in hope that I get any attention or approval from her. But nothing. Now she doesn’t know if she still loves me, I pressured her a bit into making a decision but nothing she wants more days. She litteraly told me she doesn’t love me today but doesn’t know how she feels in a few days.

I am so fucking scared I started cutting myself because of this shit, she is like a fucking goddess to me. But when we are getting too close everything crashes down and after 2 weeks we are already at a point where everything can just end. 

I need advice pls. I am fucking desperate my emotions are stronger then ever in the positive and negative"
I just watched 'Ingrid Goes West' and now I feel kinda weird,3,mjrfqw,1,"hey guys,

(I'm 21 with bpd.)

this movie was not THAT big of a hit (at least in my country) so I'm gonna write some info about it: Ingrid Goes West is a 2017 comedy-drama movie with the goddess Aubrey Plaza in the main role, and with other stars like Elizabeth Olsen and O'Shea Jackson Jr.

in the movie Aubrey's character (Ingrid) is a mentally ill young woman, who's very lonely, basically she has noone and her mother just died recently. she starts browsing social media (Instagram) a lot and find influencers who she thinks are cool and try to become friends with them. but not in the healthy way. because it's clear in the movie that she does not know how she should approach them in a healthy way. so she starts writing notes about her idol's life and then basically she just starts stalking her in real life, she bumps into her ""randomly"" and try to become friends with her, then they became friends, in her house she takes pictures of everything just to copy those in her life and to make sure that they are alike so she will love her for sure. then of course lies come out plus her favorite person becomes friends with other people and she just can't handle it.

watching this movie made me realize that I'm... basically Ingrid.?? I mean I have noone and I don't have any idea how to make healthy friendships, when I ""pick"" someone I want to ""own"" them and I don't want them to have other people in their life and that's very creepy and unhealthy. plus I literally did the same as Ingrid... I followed people on Instagram and tried to become friends with them but I had no idea how that works?? so I just wrote weird stuff to them and some of them blocked me but once I asked a Russian girl who was on holiday in my country if she wants to hang out with me, and she said yes, so we met once and hung out a bit, then I started learning Russian and became obsessed with her and Russia and decided that I'm gonna move to Moscow just to impress her and see her daily or idk??? then I saw on her IG story that she has other friends and then I was disappointed and basically just give up on my plans..

so yes, I'm not sure you guys care about this stuff but I just wanted to share it somewhere so here it is.."
I feel like crawling in a ditch or running away to live in the forest,71,mjr6r9,10,"Everyday I wake up depressed, go through my morning routine to drag me out of my funk, and go throughout the day juggling priorities. After spending a whole day trying not to breakdown, I end up feeling like everything is bullshit. I'm irritated all the time and everyone becomes a nuisance. Of course I don't want to feel these ways, and I mentally reassure myself and repeat why I need to keep going to school and work and talking to people, but I just feel so uninterested in everything. I can't even enjoy what I am passionate about. I've been putting in all this self-work and while I can look back and see how much I've progressed that alone is not enough. I have nothing in life besides knowing I did my best because everyday I feel like I am fighting something. I'm tired of telling myself that trying my best is all that matters, because it's really not. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just trying to survive. I have constant dread and want to drop everything and go. No amount of self-work has helped with these feeling."
BPD and Career!,2,mjr3sh,6,"Hey!  
For my whole life, I've always had a question to myself at the back of my head, what career would best suit me and my abilities/skills?  
Because of my BPD and mood swings, I've never been able to answer this question, because I've still got a lot to learn about my BPD and how to control it, so it doesn't get in my way on daily bases and I'd be able to create a nice future for myself and choose the things, that best suit me.   
I've noticed a lot of people with BPD are very creative, but then again that's for each person individually.  
I'd like to know, what careers have you thought about or maybe already have chosen one, that seems the best for you?  
Maybe you have something to add about a job, that was the opposite from good to you and what type of job was it and why it wasn't for you?"
BPD and Good Things!,5,mjqtic,2,"Hey!  
Aside from our BPD downs and struggles, what are some things you're proud about at this very moment?  
Maybe anyone's got some new achievements? Ate their breakfast this morning? Blocked their episode before it started? Did something new? Anything? :)  
Let's remember and point out all the good things here! Even the little things, so we can all learn to recognize even the smallest progress!"
Is it common for BPD relationships to be rushed?,0,mjqmtp,2,"She had quiet BPD. We didnt break up once until discard. She idealized me for 2-3 years, then devalued for 2-3 years then discard took 2 weeks. She would internalize a bunch and not self harm but she was a people pleaser. She also had to have her way with many things and so when she wouldnt she would hold that against others. Like when she left me she brought up things that I thought we resolved but to her it was like she remembered each salt grain in the injury (not saying there was alot nor that I ever purposely hurt her). More so just mistakes that ended up hurting her because of her sensitivity. 

She has 0 friends because she finds it hard to trust.

The first 2-3 years were idealization it seemed. Had met her in college class, she was calling me babe and such 2 weeks into texting. First date we went to a movie, dinner, and an overlook. She had me grab her boobs over the shirt while we watched a movie in the movie theatre recliners. Then at the overlook she straddled me and we made out for like an hour. Hickies etc. She wanted to get naked and likely have sex or such but I stopped her just because I really dont want to do that so quickly with someone I was/am interested in dating more so then just a hook up. When I told her we can wait she seemed down and so I explained. Then driving home, she asked if we wanted to be official since we had been talking for about 3 weeks and that this was the first date. 

Rushed very much so. 

Our second date she introduced me to her 2 siblings that are close to her in age when we went on a triple couples date. 

I met her parents like within a month.

2 months in she tells me about her traumatic relationship past (2 boyfriends during first year of college, one 4 months and he was lying to her the entire time about himself, and second one sexually assaulted her when she and he were drunk).

Each time we see each other she is doing more and more sexual stuff. 

When we finally have sex, she didnt want to use a condom because she didnt like the ""barriers between us"". I was not okay with that, we used one.

Then we discussed her getting on birth control to not use condoms and we both agreed (this would bite me in the ass despite her agreeing - later she told me she was sacrificing for us being on birth control and that it hurts her that she needed to be on it. Almost like she felt I didnt want kids with her.)

She said I love you around at 3 months. 

8 months-1 year she was talking about having a family with me and getting engaged secretly so her parents didnt find out. She mentioned getting pregnant and moving away for 9 months so her family wouldn't know (their religious).This didn't happen because ... college and I set a clear boundary thats not what I wanted to do right then. But also after time went on this fizzled out despite me telling her I wanted this when we graduated so I could support and afford things.

We texted every single day good morning and goodnight despite whatever was happening. If I missed a text, she would get mad or sad like I didnt care. 

She almost always wanted to spend time with her family and not mine, her reasoning was because she felt comfortable around them and their loyal to her so she feels safe.

During the phase of devaluation, it began when she expected to get engaged on our 4 year anniversary. We drove home after a weekend vacation, she cried 3 of the 4 hours and was mad and sad with me because she created this expectation of it happening and when it didnt she felt I didnt love her or that I didnt want to take the next steps. I shared with her my plans to get engaged a few months following graduation - she still was sad. So after this, anything I did to remotely hurt her without intent and to even the smallest degree she held like an umpire calling 3 strikes. Things I figured we talked through and moved past she never moved past because she brought them up during the 2 week breakup discard phase. 

Her quiet BPD would come out in her pouting like a child and blaming others for the pain she felt. For example at the beginning of covid she wanted to take a trip with me and her sister. We both said to her that we felt uncomfortable because of covid and didn't want to go. She got really hurt and said ""I am simply trying to figure out plans for us to get out of the house and enjoy ourselves, but you two just shut my idea down so it doesnt even matter.""

Does this seem normal for those with BPD? 

Or is this just how a normal long term relationship progresses?"
"I'm not currently diagnosed with BPD since I'm younger than 18, but I have some concerns, did anyone else have them?",0,mjqjso,1,"Long story short though, I'm currently diagnosed with GAD for about 3 years now and it was hell getting to understand what I'm experiencing and getting a diagnosis, given the fact that I live in a third world country.

It was an awful experience getting overprescribed by benzodiazepines in the early days of my diagnosis. All in all you get the picture, shitty mental health care, shitty therapy.

I've always got concerns on whether or not I have BPD and through research I feel like i strongly relate to Quiet BPD. Now alright I don't wanna seem like a ""Self diagnosed / Furry / Half demon / Xe/Xem"", But I'm honestly pretty concerned and just understanding or putting a label that'll make me understand these random awful experiences would make it much easier to deal with.

Is there any other way I could get a proper diagnosis or do I have to just keep playing russian roulette with therapists and psychiatrists until i find a proper one that'll help? And did anyone else experience this in their youth too?"
I screwed myself over....again..,6,mjqjki,4,"So I was six months clean of self harm after my last favorite person leaving sent me over the edge and threw me into a mental hospital. Then I start talking to this guy because he followed me on insta and alot of my friends are friends with him. So then boom ten minutes into our first convo my brain was like “You love him and also he’s your favorite person.” So then he found out pretty quickly because Im really bad at hiding my emotions for people and he asked me “hey do you love me?” And instead of lying I was like “yes” and we discussed that he wasnt interested in that kind of relationship that we would just stay friends. Well then boom, I realize hey he doesnt talk to me much anymore, and he also seems not interested when we do talk so I should probably ask him about it. And everytime I asked he was like “no its okay, Im just busy.” And for some reason my dumbass believed him??? So then That leads to quite a few self harm relapses and feeling like Im the worst person to ever exist. And then today I thought about attempting again and my friend talked me out of it and convinced me mine and his relationship was unhealthy so I needed to stop being his friend. And so I did and then he was like “Yeah youre just too intense.” And LIKE FUCK I TOLD YOU I HAVE BPD AND THAT YOURE MY FAVORITE PERSON WHAT DO YOU EXPECT??? But yeah so thats how I sabotaged yet another relationship with someone because Im awful and shouldnt be on earth."
My FP My husband left me,10,mjqd9t,6,"My husband and I planned to move to Australia. We sold our house and moved into a friend's Airbnb. We've been stuck in the house for a year by the way. When we get here we are both freaked out and fighting and he tells me he wants a divorce. He left me to go collect the rest of his stuff that's in a way another state 2 weeks ago. He'll be gone for a month and a half but will be back. Before he left he took all his stuff and put it in a different storage unit. 
I I'm freaking out so i went to a Psychiatrist he tells me I have BPD. Wtf? He's like without a doubt. I go to the therapist. Same thing. I've been married 17 years. I've held down a career for almost 20 years. And none of it matters. It all went to HELL. I'm in a run down fucked up cabin in the middle of nowhere, screaming crying losing my mind about to send in a letter excusing me from work for at least a month from the psychiatric hospital because I can't find baseline. I dropped my wallet thankfully it was found at security, my dog ran in the street I think I might have to leave him with a friend, every second every breath every moment is spent thinking about my husband. I can't sleep I can't eat I can't stop thinking about him. It's physically painful. I read about what an FP is. He is obviously mine. It makes me question everything about the reality of our relationship. It is absolutely soul shattering. I feel like if I look at it too hard I may end up breaking something in my head. I feel the most unstable I have felt since I was a kid and I am no kid by any means.
What do i do? It's not getting easier like everybody tells me or what should be happening.
What the ACTUAL FUCK?!"
I’m tired of this empathy...,10,mjq1nm,3,"I am filled with so much empathy, it hurts. I don’t feel anything for myself anymore. I wish I could be my own person.... I wish I didn’t feel everyone else’s pain at such a deep level. Because no one.... no one ever feels mine. I’m all alone in this."
Dissociating and trying to take the other person's perspective during social situations...?,1,mjptpp,0,"I've realized this is something I do, I think I've done it most of my life, and it's kinda horrifying. 

A lot of the time, if I've been alone and relaxed and then I go to talk to someone, it's like I tense up and I can feel my attention changing in a way where I start almost observing myself somewhat in 3rd person. My focus shifts, and rather than being able to just be me and focus on my thoughts, half of my brain is just thinking about what I think they're thinking and how they'd want me to be, and often end up acting according to it.

 It happens so naturally to me around people. It's like the 1st person view, my sense of myself as an independent existing person and everything is just swept out from under me like a rug. Most of my own thoughts leave my mind, and I'm trying to act like this little puppet and please the other person. If I try to fight it, try to be myself and just not think about this at all... well, at times it's just impossible to do, and it feels so intensely anxiety-inducing that I have to dissociate and people-please again to keep from going crazy with anxiety. 

I don't know whether this is a people-pleasing, fawning type think, or whether it's masking (from ASD), or what.

Does anyone else do this?"
"When you're BPD and you're idolizing someone, and you know someone who has BPD (ex) and is idolizing you.",1,mjpt1e,1,"This is so painful. I can't feel anything for her, and I know that she's absolutely obsessed with me, feels like I'm everything. They feel like I'm the best thing on earth, and want to be with me so much, even if it means that I'll hurt them. I know I'm going to hurt them so I can't be with them. I know that it'll only be toxic if I'm with her again.

Meanwhile I'm obsessing over someone (My FP), and being in the position of being rejected is difficult to cope with although I've mostly gotten over it and can now have a healthy relationship with them, without the obsession being present. But with her, she's not making much improvement. She still wants to be with me so, so, very bad. And I just cannot do it. It gives me perspective to how the obsessed feels about the obsessor, and I know just how much pain she is feeling for me, because I felt so much pain when I couldn't be with him. I felt like life was pointless without him at the worst of it, and she's straight up told me that's how she feels since she can't be with me. And I just can't change the way I feel.

If there's anything positive about this:

\-It makes it really clear how it feels to be an FP, I guess, because I am hers.

\-It makes it really clear how it feels to be obsessed over when that isn't what you want.

\-It makes it clear to me how I need to keep my obsessions together, or else I'll lose a nice, positive person in my life."
I want to die. Tw ig,7,mjpkzk,12,"Plain and simple. I want to die. Idgaf about the stupid suicide hotline that gets posted. I want to die so bad. I cant do this anymore. Im a fucking idiot. No one has ever actually cared about me.

Im just laying here praying something kills me."
"In a crisis over my ex, help, cw suicide",2,mjp6bb,0,"I am splitting over my ex, I am suicidal, I am alone, crisis services are useless, I feel so ashamed. 
Found out ex was sleeping with his ex while together and after, he's a narcissist, he's got a new girlfriend and all I can do is cry and feel sick about it. If this goes on I am going to hurt myself. I feel such a fool for loving him, and still somehow am hurt that he's moved on. Before I knew new information I found out I was still very much not over him, pining for him, and now I know he deserves none of it but it hurts so much I am throwing up.
Police and ambulance have nothing to offer, crisis team has nothing to offer, they've already visited me in the house. I've made a noose.

I need help getting my mind off this, the more I think about my ex the more desperate I get. I cant call anyone and wake them up even tho I'm suicidal. I really don't know what to do. I want to talk to someone until I fall asleep, and just be safe. "
"sudden, intense, blinding anger that comes on suddenly from small triggers that literally make me dizzy",51,mjp2x7,11,i don’t know if anybody else gets this. maybe it’s because of the medication i’m on?? i’m on lamictal 300 and the side effects hit me hard. something as small as someone saying something that gets on my nerves can trigger an intense emotion that literally makes me dizzy from how intense and fast it came on. i never expect it. it only lasts a few seconds as well
"I want more attention from my boyfriend; even though he spends most of his time on me, I still weirdly feel ignored?",2,mjozp8,2,"26F here. I feel too petty to ask for it... I feel like being toxic AF and ignoring him because I feel kind of hurt. Like he went to his family for Easter then invited me last minute cuz I guess he realized it’s rude, then he went out with friends to a bar and didn’t even call to say goodnight to me. Idk I just feel like less loved by him and i feel like rejecting him since I feel rejected, that way I can save my ego and pretend it’s not him leaving me but my own choice. I was abandoned a lot as a child, so I know that’s why I act this way, but it doesn’t change the fact that I still want to do it :/ I just wish he realized that yes I’m dramatic and annoying but calling me to say goodnight means a lot to me and he knows I had a bad day so I just wish he connected the dots himself . He does spend most of his time on me I think I just need to be a brat and vent here on a forum where ppl can understand me without thinking I’m an ass. I’m letting him enjoy his time but ugh just feeling ignored and less important rn"
I feel more sane when I’m on my period and crazier when I’m not on it,9,mjox9l,4,"It’s like reverse PMS. It clearly seems hormonal, but I hate it and when I try to explain it I don’t think others understand. My mom said she notices it too that on my period I’m so rational and level headed and calm but the moment it ends I’m like angry and anxious and constantly picking fights."
Increase of extremely bad memory :(,94,mjo6r9,18,"I am running into an unpleasant issue.  
I have almost no memory of my childhood.  
I forgot almost everything that has happened in 2019  
and my teenage years have HUGE memory gaps too.  
Entire years are kinda gone.  
I also can barely memorize faces and situations. Even if they happened just a day ago.  
It is getting very very scary.  
Sometimes when I wake up and I look around I have troubles realising where I am.  
It is becoming very scary.. :("
Paraphilia / weight gain fetish with BPD?,0,mjnr8j,0,Does anyone on here have an atypical sexuality/paraphilia? I (26 F) have an exclusively non vanilla sexuality (paraphilia) for weight gain. It is the only thing that arouses me. This is called colloquially and feedism fetish. I do not participate in those activities for obvious reasons but it sure makes vanilla sex and intimacy hard for me! I have been discussing my paraphilia with my therapist and he pointed out the interesting potential correlation between chronic feeling of emptiness in BPD and my arousal for the idea of being/making others extremely full. Just thought I’d see if anyone else on here has similar or related sexualities or if you think it’s unrelated to BPD
i have no friends and i feel like it inevitable that im going to be lonely forever (tw for suicidal thoughts),13,mjnp7u,4,"(kind of a vent but i want advice and support) 

i have lost my only friend (well not really but she is embarrassed to be seen with me and doesnt show interest in me anymore also she is my fp) and now i have no friends, no close family members, nothing but my pet dog im still young so im trying to hang on until college to see if theres a possibility that i might make a friend there but i feel like its stupid for me to think that someone will want to be friends with me considering i have bpd and social anxiety so im really awkward. my biggest fear is being lonely and i have to face that fear every second im alive and it's unbearable. if anyone else who struggles with bpd and/or social anxiety has any advice for making friends please let me know because i dont know what to do anymore i literally cannot fathom an independent life with no friends nor do i want to become an independent person. is it inevitable that im going to be lonely if i stick around just waiting for someone to magically come along? i NEED to make a friend desperately but have no idea how too because im currently being homeschooled and too scared to go back to irl school, i have terrible social skills due to being lonely and barely ever speaking for my entire childhood due to bullying and being emotionally neglected and abused at home. i feel really hopeless right now and cannot picture any kind of future :/ any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙏"
Sickening low self-esteem (tw: suicide),5,mjnoxq,7,"\*Not looking for advice, although encouragement, relating, and personal anecdotes or shares are welcome\*

Hey everyone. I have been doing awful lately. I think that I am weak to my severe depression. I often think why haven't I killed myself yet. Writing those words definitely hurts me..but..honestly I question whether I will ever be someone who realizes her goals and lives a fruitful life. You need motivation, discipline, and good mental health for that. Folks I am losing the battle and have struggled and suffered for years now. Do I just accept that I am going to live a crappy life? It's up to me to be happy and make the changes that  I need to make but I won't or can't. But living a crappy life feels so bad. Going from ""meh I'm used to it"" to ""Fuck I can't take this anymore!! I need to make a change, NOW!!"" but still not being able to. And I do put myself down for that all the time. For being weak. For being too scared to make a change. For thinking it is too hard to take action. Too hard to successfully change my diet, too hard to hold down a meaningless job in late-stage capitalism. 

Everything is too hard. First off I wake up and get hit with the hard reality living with this illness and how shitty life is and has been. It takes hours for me build up the motivation to do something. Today was doing laundry. And that task was motivated by the anxiety and pressure of needing to do it. Is this going to be my life every day? Only completing one task and being like ""welp, that's enough for today."" How the hell can I get anywhere in my life living like that?

My main point of this post and how I feel is that I feel too weak to this illness. That I feel like life is too hard, and blaming myself for how hard life is (after all, it's my negative thoughts right?) In this life, it is required of me to force myself to do the basic necessities to exist. But I don't want to. I want my dreams and desires to arrive at my doorstep. That's why I often think about suicide. I obviously don't want to put in the effort it takes to bring about positive change (plus I have already tried so hard for years to change my mental illness around), and because of that and because I fail I should therefore kill myself. I'm living a passive death anyways. But I know suicide isn't the answer, and I wouldn't be successful. 

Please I just want life to be easier. If I wasn't at the mercy of my severe depression I think I could live a decent life. But I haven't learned how to manage my depression, how to beat it, and so..I'm just failing at life and suffering every day."
Does anyone else constantly hate the way you handle situations?,350,mjnmlc,33,"It doesn’t matter whether I handled a situation appropriately or not, I’ll still beat myself up over it

One day, I’ll look back and hate myself for being too harsh to someone and the next I’ll hate myself for being too calm and there’s never any in between

It gets really distressing having to deal with these thoughts because they consume me"
how do i find out someone if someone is mad at me without directly asking?,0,mjnl06,2,"usually no one is ever really mad at me. but whenever i think someone is currently upset with me i cannot do anything but obsess over it and get depressed. like i know they’re not mad but i’m feeling all of the sadness from it anyways.


before, i’d just directly ask “are you mad” in the hopes they’d simply say “no” and i’d feel fine again but of course the average person is gonna have a reaction to that question because it’s pretty weird to ask out of nowhere. it’s also annoying to always be asked that.


so is there a way i can find out without them knowing i feel they are upset? does this situation make sense to anyone else?"
just realized a friend unfollowed me on instagram and i’m losing it,3,mjnkgq,3,So i’ve been having a rough time as of late concerning friendships. My roommate and I used to be part of a big friend group and ended up splitting up getting separate off campus apartments. The 3 friends in the other apartment would invite my roommate to hang out and not me. I usually had work or plans with my other friends so I just kind of ignored it. It became more frequent and I could just tell they didn’t want to tell me things or hang out with me. One of them just unfollowed me(although I think she actually blocked me then unblocked me) and I absolutely lost it. My roommate chooses them over me literally all the time and ignores me for weeks at a time. The other friend unblocking me made me feel physically hot I was so pissed of. So yeah one person who i’m not even close to led me to me crying for 3 hours and ripping the posters off my wall in my bedroom. FMLLLLLLL
Why do I completely disappear and just watch it happen...,3,mjni5d,3,"I’ve been taking a few medications to cope with my extreme mood swings, and while they can blunt some of the symptoms, when I’m ACTIVELY “in an episode”, it’s like I’m not here. I call it an episode because it’s-- I’m not there. I’m not me. It’s like I forget who my boyfriend is and what he’s like, I forget physically where I am, and I have these violent sudden urges to run and self harm. I can say positive things I’ve learned in therapy but it’s like fighting the sea. I don’t even get the chance to think before I do something it’s like it’s just happening. I don’t sit and contemplate even, I’m just beating the shit out of myself by any means I can get my hands on. Whatever’s closest. I’ve tried DBT, it couldn’t even be utilized until I got on meds, and they worked in the beginning but they’ve been of little help lately. I just see what I’ve done later. It hurts my partner greatly. I do it to punish myself, “for being bad” (angry, or other feeling I’m not supposed to feel) which will cause me to be “abandoned and hated”. There’s an internal voice that speaks only in the second person, and I’m just subject to it’s abuse, physical and otherwise. It talks like “I’m going to kill you.” And “I’m gonna (hurt you)”. There’s a refractory period where I can think clearly/calmly for a few seconds then I hurt myself again, then for like maybe 20 seconds, then again. An hour later- again. 
I know, I have a diagnosis of PTSD too. I’m sure many of us do. I’ve only seen online articles talk about “contemplation” - not sudden violent “involuntary” compulsions to do it. God it’s hard, I feel so abusive.

I don’t have enough time to think. I’m just sitting in a destructive body. What does it take to get me out of that rush? Has anyone dealt with that?"
Not officially diagnosed so does it count..?,1,mjncmn,9,"I knew I had depression in my teenage year, but never thought of bpd back then. I'm 20y.o, and it's only last year that, when I was reading about mental illnesses, I can across stuff I 100% related to, and the name was bpd. I took an online test, result was that I certainly had it, and that I should get officially diagnosed. But I don't have the money nor the time to do it.
Then I talked about it to one of my closest friend and they said that it was pretty obvious for them. But I still don't want to self diagnose myself, it just looks like I'm seeking attention, because for so long, I thought that what I was feeling was normal.
When I told another friend about it they also told me that it was obvious, and even now they pick up stuff i do to prove it to me. 
But the thing is, I don't want to ""reclaim"" it till i officially get diagnosed, but also, some symptoms are there and it's undeniable. So if hypothetically I'm interested in someone, what should I tell them? Or should I even tell them anything at all?"
I’m tired of my attention-seeking behavior and feeling fake,29,mjn66q,7,"I am in extreme distress, but no one else sees it or believes it. Despite being professionally diagnosed with many disorders (in addition to BPD), none of these professionals seem to take me seriously. I have been told time and time again by everyone that I have not had “enough bad things” happen in my life to warrant my mental health issues; to be fair, I haven’t had any trauma aside from intense, long-term bullying during my childhood. As a result of this, I feel the need to “act out” and exaggerate to prove how much distress I’m in. It’s creating a vicious cycle.

Everyone seems to assume that I’m just looking for an excuse or looking for sympathy. I am trying so hard not to over-exaggerate my problems, but it’s hard not to when no one is taking me seriously when I’m being genuine. I don’t want to have to fake anything. I am genuinely in extreme distress every day of my life and it’s taking a toll on my life. In a way, I am looking for sympathy and being attention seeking, but it’s not out of malicious intent. 

I am so tired of not being taken seriously for everything I’m going through. I’m so tired for feeling like I’m faking everything for sympathy. I’m so tired of being a burden to myself and everyone around me. I’m tired of being exhausted because I can’t handle things or function as well as everyone around me. 

Note: while I did flair this as a vent, I am also looking for advice and support."
DAE want different things from their FP depending on the day,0,mjn5m4,0,"I feel like the things I want from my FP and the reasons why I want them completely change day to day. Last week I wanted her to be my mother and take care of me like a child, the week before that I wanted to be in a relationship with her or simply wanted her to cheat on her husband for a night with me, this week I just envy her and want the life she lives because I think it’s a worthy life.  I want what she has while also wanting to be a part of what she has. 

How do I deal with my feelings for her when I can’t even decide week to week what I’m actually feeling for her? I’d like for things to just be normal with her but I don’t know how to get to that point."
This weeks been hell. New job and just found out my bf cheated on me,1,mjn4e4,1,"We’ve been together for nearly 3 years. We’ve been having issues. I’ve been off the rails because he works out of town and I never get to see or speak to him much, when we do he’s distant. He can back from work after nearly 3 weeks and didn’t even smile when he saw me. I started my new job the next day, it’s an opportunity I can’t pass up for my future so it’s really important my mental health is decent. He didn’t want me around and I had a full on breakdown. I hadn’t slept or eaten so that intensified my mood. I punched myself and hyperventilated until I went to sleep. The next day we decided to not see each other for a few days and have some space. I found out he went to my brothers house with cocaine and was up all night. I told him to never bring coke to my brothers house and he did. I was furious. I was starting work and he was high and so uncaring to me. We didn’t see eachother for 2 days and decided yesterday to see eachother again. We were having a great day, I wanted to work past all the issues we’ve been having. We had sex and just laughed all day. Until I brought up the fact that one of his friends has been trying to contact me since the morning he did blow. His friend wanted me to call him. I knew something was up because I never hear from this person. I confronted bf and he told me that he was high and drunk and called a bunch of friends to tell them how crazy I am. He said he talked to a female friend and one thing lead to another and he got nudes from her. He told me that she said “don’t you have a gf” his response is “she’s crazy man” and then it progressed. I’m so fucked up and I don’t know what to do. I can’t be alone, I can’t believe he did this to me, again after regaining my trust. I feel ugly and worthless and I’m so fucking hurt. I can’t go through a breakup again it will kill me"
DAE fantasize about bad things happening to their FP,0,mjn2mk,9,"CW: mentions SA

I find myself fantasizing about my FP being in a situation that would cause a lot of emotional pain (most of the time some sort of SA) because I want her to confide in me. I feel so much guilt about this because obviously I don't want her to be in pain, I just feel like it would prove to me that she likes me. I feel like if she told me something that serious I would struggle to believe our relationship is one sided."
Sinking in,6,mjmru7,6,"When I was a kid, you were the biggest star in my eyes. You were my crush; I watched all of your videos. I looked deeper into your profile to understand you more. As the years went by, I was really invested in your work and your world from a computer screen. I dated someone in high school and put away that ridiculous crush. The high school relationship ended (as most of them do) and I went back to the obsession. I found a way to contact you. You answered back! It was incredible! I had just turned into an adult months prior. Finally, we were going to meet up after talking for a while over the phone. It was the scariest experience of my life. I’ve never been the type to sneak out, but I did it for you, and myself. I wanted to feel freedom and excitement. You were 3 hours away. It was a LONG drive. I pulled up to your driveway after midnight, sweating and shaking with nerves. You tapped on widow for me to come in, and the rest of that night felt like a fever dream. A few more visits passed by and I got to meet the real you. I asked you not to do what you did, many times beforehand. I was facing away from you. I begged you to stop. You hit me in the face and it was that moment I realize this was a grown man who’s doubled my size, and I was really in trouble. I fought, cried, and blood was everywhere, dripping down my legs, in the cracks of my toes. I smeared the blood from my legs to my fingers and shined it in the bathroom light so you could see. “Look what you did to me”. My face was hot, felt like my tears had turned into steam, which pushed back into my eyes. You just kept laughing. I was in a place I shouldn’t have been in. I wasn’t supposed to be there, no one knew where I was. It was beyond too late to get out of there, and I wasn’t supposed to be in a certain place until the next morning. My head was pounding from the pain. I felt that my insides had torn, almost to the point where I was afraid a doctor would have to be involved and the police would’ve been called. Even after this you still took advantage and had some fun for yourself. The next morning you gave me breakfast and kissed me goodbye. My emotions swapped from extremely scared to forgiving. 2 weeks had passed by, I watched your video and you had told that awful moment to 200,000+ people. Granted, you didn’t use my name, but strangely during those 2 weeks, my mind went blank of the incident. I even messaged you and said it was a funny story. The physical bleeding pain took 5 days to get over. Now and then the act would appear in my mind, but I would quickly cancel it out. It took a real friend, (not the friend I had told before, who only laughed, glancing over what I had said to think the whole thing was just a kink I was into) to point out that I was wronged. Everyone in the video was laughing, the comments were laughing, and comments asking questions, “Why would some girl allow that to happened? Jesus! this guy hooks up with straight-up whores” the crazy part is I still see you. Maybe this is an attempt to convince me, what happened wasn’t a waste. That maybe there are good times to come. Only a few times did I enjoy myself. I’m in a constant cycle, I need to leave, but my brain doesn’t want me to go. I’m trapped in my mind. I want to be free from everyone. I want to let people know, that’s why I’m writing this, but I can’t have my family involved. I don’t want my true identity out there. 

Please protect yourself, please don’t do what I did. Never. Meet. Your. Heroes. 

They can be monsters"
“You could be so much worse”,2,mjmo6f,5,"Does anyone else get triggered by this? My partner and I were discussing YouTube videos he had seen featuring people with BPD, and I asked if they reminded him of me in any way just to spark conversation about myself and my negative borderline habits. He replied that no, not particularly, and that they behaved in a way that was worse and more extreme than me. I asked how, and he explained that they cut themselves more often and said nastier things than I do. I immediately split on him. I interpreted it as him implying that my pain is not as bad as their pain. I know it is absolutely ridiculous and that was not his intention, but I feel so unsure of myself and my identity as a “sick” person. Why am I like this."
Question,0,mjm74y,1,"Does anyone have any tips for helping to dig out of a depressive rut?

My fiancée and I split it January, and I am having a very hard time of it emotionally."
"My bf won't answer me and I think he's sick of me and wants to leave me. And if he doesn't, I think me freaking out will make him.",2,mjl9rw,3,"I am freaking tf out. My bf and I have been together for almost 2 years. With my bpd and his add, we have our hiccups, but for the most part it's good. I love him very much.
About a week ago, after he left my place, he stopped answering my messages as often. He'd text a reply maybe 2-3 times a day, where normally we'd text on off through out the whole day. He just got a new PS game and he said he's been in his own little world playing his game and not paying attention to his phone, which in and of itself is fair enough... But it hurts, and I get scared. I told him this and asked that he'd try to remember to check his phone once in a while, like when he takes breaks to get food or things like that, and if he could at least text me goodnight when he goes to bed so I know he's not angry or ignoring me.
But he didn't.
He came over yesterday and we had another talk about it, where he promised to be more considerate, and I believed him...
Except I haven't heard a word from him since he left 15 hours ago. Ive sent some texts and tried to keep my cool, but I'm just about to lose it. I tried calling him but it goes straight to voice mail.
I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm dying. I have a feeling that his phone battery is dead and he's gone to bed (it's half past 2 in the morning), but that means he hasn't set an alarm and probably won't wake up til very late, and I probably won't get a reply before tomorrow afternoon.
I am so fucking scared of laying here alone with all these feelings. I'm so sad, and scared, and pissed, and hurt. I feel like he's going to leave me, which I told him, and he said that's not going to happen... But idk. I've considered telling him that we NEED to work this out, and that it needs to stop bc it's destroying me, and if we don't I fear it's gonna be the end of us, because I can't stand being in this state of emotion for much longer... But I'm also scared that if I say that then he's going to crack and tell me that he actually wants to break up with me, and that that's why he's been withdrawing"
i can NEVER be just moderately sad,56,mjl4qs,13,"something inconvenient happens? a perceived abandonment/insult? buckle up because my whole day is going to be spent SPIRALING, literally contemplating suicide or dramatic isolation.

I put us on a break.,1,mjkj7a,2,"5 years, in love with this boy, I truly believe he's the one for me. But lately his behavior has been abhorrent. Sleeping all day. Spending like crazy. Short temper. Up all night. Snaps at me. Makes it obvious when he doesn't want to do something. Eggs me on when he can tell I'm upset. How do I deal with this? I'm hurting so much. Not just from the time apart but from the way he's been to me as a whole. I feel lost. I wish I knew life alone."
Does anyone else find dissociating kind of comforting?,146,mjk31m,18,"I know it’s a coping mechanism to distance yourself from the present reality or to deal with the effects of a traumatic event, but does anyone else find it kind of... nice?
I dissociate so often I find that most of my days feel like blurs. But I like the feeling of just being able to tune out of real life for a minute and feel nothing. Due to a recent devastating passing in my family, all I want is to feel nothing. Dissociation numbs the pain. It makes me feel like my body isn’t mine and like I’m watching my life through someone else’s eyes. The first time I experienced it it scared me, It felt like being high or something. But now I can do it on command and find myself zoning out just to stay sane. Lately I don’t know who I am. I don’t know how to talk to people anymore. I don’t have the motivation to socialize. I don’t feel like myself. I’m so in my head all the time worrying about saying something stupid, so I just don’t say anything at all. I feel broken and incapable of functioning like a normal person. I see all these people around me making connections and enjoying themselves but the only time I feel at peace is when I feel like I’m not really there. But then I hate myself for being so socially awkward. I wasn’t always like that. I used to be the most social person in the room and now I’m the one in the corner zoning out of the conversation. How can I get people to like me when I don’t even know who me is anymore? Damn. I don’t want to die but taking a 5 month nap and waking up when shit isn’t shit anymore sounds really fucking nice."
Does anyone else find their emotions intensified?,7,mjjz5r,3,"As the title says. Honestly, it feels as if my emotiona are intensified by so much. If I'm mad, I get very mad, sad I get extremely depressed, etc, etc. If I'm being honest, and as negative as it may be, I tend to shut off any and all emotions because of it. It sucks, but I'd rather be a blank slate than extremely angered, sad, or whatever else there may be."
I think I am manipulating my Ex into getting back with me and it’s making me feel like a bad person.,0,mjjygd,2,My ex has moved on and found a guy who sounds really good for her but i can’t help myself. As a naturally jealous man I am making hints that he may not be the best for her. Her new boo is always busy and I am stressing to her that I will always make time for her. I think I am manipulating her but it’s hard to resist because of my abandonment issues.
How do I learn how to take decisions,4,mjj6ry,10,"I (19f) just can't take decisions, I think too much. Idk how people can just choose and move on. I left my toxic relationship some week ago only to go back in it again. I feel stuck, please help me."
Give me a moment,5,mjizg0,1,"Sometimes I feel so unstable.  I don't think anyone can deal with me. I feel alone. Empty. I can be strong. But  sometimes I want someone my side. I want to fall in love, but I'm such a mess."
I'm in a relationship with someone who has BPD and I want to be as supportive and helpful as possible. What are resources I can use and what are things I should know?,4,mjiw01,2,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 months, and there are times where she is obsessed with me and I love it, but there are also days/times where she is very distanced with me, finds things to complain about in everything, and generally wants to keep a lot of distance between us.

We communicate about it, about how she can see it happening, understand it, but it still happens. About how she's ashamed about it a bit and hates herself for it.

I want to be as supportive as I can, she's such a perfect match with me and I really want to be there for her in every way that I can. I'm currently doing my best to make her not feel trapped with me. I'll ask if she wants a hug or if she wants space, and I'll never question the answer regardless of what it is. I do my best to be with her and make sure she knows I'm not abandoning her when I'm not around, I know that's one thing that bothers her, and I will always be just a text or a phone call away.


What are things I can do better for her? What resources can I use to help and help her feel safe and reduce triggers?"
How do you now bring up stuff that’s been a problem the whole time?,8,mjik7x,3,"This sounds weird but I think it’s a quiet bpd trait so maybe not to yous? I realise it’s the exact same patterns I have with my emotions except this is physical which is why I think it’s weird.

I’m constantly in a mild amount of pain. More of an ache maybe. It’s not like immediately inhibiting but it affects my actions. Like I always lay instead of sit, for example, to the point where I now can’t comfortably sit down. 
I’ve never really told anyone this cos it didn’t seem relevant. I manage it, there’s nothing anyone else can do or that I need them to. It’s partly because I broke my back a few years ago and I think the rest of my body is due to being so sedentary afterwards so I’m pretty ashamed. 
I don’t think about it. I literally only noticed it was such a thing when I drank ayahuasca and realised I was blocking it out a lot and letting my subconscious mind deal with it.

I live with two people with painful chronic conditions so it would be ridiculous to complain when it’s so mild. 

But now it’s dawning on me that all this pushing shit into my subconscious is hiding from me the real extent of how it’s affecting me. I will constantly put off doing anything physical regardless of how much I enjoy it. I won’t even know why. I’m usually stoned so I’ve been chalking it down to that but I’ve been sober a little while now and I’m realising that there’s a process in which I picture doing literally anything and amongst any other feelings there’s an underlying exhaustion and I never realised why or even really that it was there. The feeling of exhaustion is disproportionate the actual pain I feel, almost like I’m picturing it as being excruciating, perhaps rationality lost by this process being mostly subconscious?

It’s affecting the people I care about. I cancel all my plans even though I was really excited about them and suppress the disappointment so I just have this constant apathy going on and don’t really understand why. 
I’m not doing enough round the house, the dog needs more attention and my sex life is non existent. And I’m just sat here ignoring it all, hating myself, feeling so distant from anyone and anything and having no idea why. 

Everything just feels like such a mess. I feel like I’ve wasted most of my life and it sort of feels like I’m lying to the people around me, like I’m hiding some deep, dark secret even I’m not fully aware of. 
And I feel like I can’t just say this now. My boyfriend fell out with me today about things that are directly related to this and I didn’t say much cos I didn’t know what to. My mind was completely blank because I had no idea why. It’s only after that I’ve been thinking and noticed just how much pain I’m in. Particularly when sitting up which is how I need to be to do a lot of things I’m putting off. If I go back now and say “oh yeah Soz about the last two years, turns out I’m actually in pain and just never thought to mention it”. That sounds so fucking stupid. Especially when he’s currently in agony due to his own conditions. The ironic part is he’s constantly apologising for complaining about being in pain and I’m constantly reassuring him that he really doesn’t need to apologise nor suppress his expressions."
How do you handle the feeling of emptiness?,10,mjigo2,2,"I often feel empty and purposeless, like there is nothing to look forward to. I feel a dissatisfaction with life. I guess it is hard to put into words how I often feel but emptiness has a lot to do with it."
Trigger Warning,5,mji670,3,"I get so tired of being worried about what other people think of me. It’s where most of my anxiety comes from, if not all of it. That fear of abandonment. Having no confidence in myself as a human being, or even as an adult. I feel like a child trapped inside a body, constantly reaching for any type of approval I can get. Constantly questioning myself and my interactions and if I’m good enough. Even if I am totally cool and capable in the moment, the second I step away my mind is clouded with doubt, insecurity, and second guessing. 
That’s the shit that makes me want to kill myself. More than absolutely anything else. If I have to deal with this unrest for the remainder of my life, why shouldn’t I end it? 

Anyways - this is how my brain spirals on a low. No matter how much time I have between lows, it’s like the last one never stopped. Does anyone relate to this specifically? I’m really shitty at putting this feeling into real words, so if it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry."
BPD as a PD,6,mji3sk,13,"does anyone else hate the debate on whether BPD is a BPD or not? some people think it’s a mood or identity disorder. personally, i find that damaging. it is a BPD. it shares aspects with other PDs, for one. i just hate the debate on it."
What the heck am I doing?,3,mjhu1a,2,"So I dont know if this fits here, but i recently started cutting dumb things in my body,  
namely:  
""I USE ARCH BTW""  
a Archlinux Logo  
2x the word ""MEOW""

Anyone else afraid to be in a new relationship?,8,mjhqn3,2,"I’m so afraid that I will do something stupid and hurt that person/ruin our relationship.

"When therapists have been understanding, patient, etc., what did it mean for you?",3,mjh19x,2,"What difference did it make to your treatment and how you felt about treatment?

e.g. I would say myself, when I had a good therapist who I felt had patience and didn't judge me or push me too much, I felt safer to explore and disclose information I had previously been too scared to mention.

I'm a therapy student who has a history of significant mental illness nad a BPD diagnosis- trying to become the right sort of professional. I've experienced a lot of bad treatment myself from ill-informed staff who have been inaprropriate and rude. Some professional make too many assumptions about things they don't understand."
I feel so unhappy,9,mjgzp5,4,"This disorder is so damn painful. Every day I feel like I'm somehow trying to get through life, but don't know what I'm doing because I wasn't granted a manual to life that all the functional people seem to own. It kind of feels like I fell out of my mother's womb straight into quicksand of some sort. Some days I'm able to stay more afloat than on others, but when I look back, I somehow haven't made any progress at all when it comes to getting out of it. I'm still stuck in the same exact spot and I don't really see a way out."
Does anybody else experience periods of extreme hyper sensitiveness to emotions occasionally?,11,mjgwi9,4,"This is going to sound weird maybe, I honestly don't know if it's my bipolar II disorder or the borderline personality disorder, but sometimes maybe once every 2 weeks or more, I get extremely emotional and cry **very very** easily at things that wouldn't normally make me cry. 

For example I'm watching Godzilla versus King Kong. The most basic of sad parts in the movie are making me literally tear up and want to just bawl. 

Normally when I see things like this I would think ""oh that's sad"" But it wouldn't phase me emotionally, I wouldn't have nearly as an emotional response."
DAE: Has anyone else had therapy problems?,8,mjgwhi,4,"I've changed so many therapists, I won't even mention the number because it's unbelievable. The things they say irritate me easily, I feel like they don't care enough to ask me the right questions or say the right things to me. Often I feel like I don't want to open up to them, or to express any feelings in therapy. Then they always point that out and that irritates me even more and it makes me even more unwilling to open up lol. Other times I take their words the wrong way, I accuse them of things and I start a fight. I've had fights with almost all of them, even the most patient and polite ones haha.  


I guess I am what you'd call a difficult patient. I was wondering if I am the only one."
Close friend (22F) of 4 years isn’t comfortable being with me (21M) in her apartment without a third person present,0,mjgwbk,11,"I don’t think this is a personal thing, I think this is just a general rule that this person lives by, and I respect that—I was the one who suggested that she might not be comfortable in this situation in the first place. But it is still a shock and hurts a lot that this friend doesn’t trust me enough to be alone around me. We’ve been on walks together and spent plenty of time 1 on 1 at school. Our friendship is 100% platonic and I would never think of crossing a boundary, and I’ve never felt any attraction to her regardless. It just feels very strange that I’m seen as a potential aggressor; I would be all for her being cautious with people she knows only moderately well, but we know each other about as well as anyone knows us. 

Can any men or women offer some perspective here, or suggestions on how I can cope with the irrational insecurity that I might be abusive at heart?"
I am just so tired,0,mjgvk5,1,"Sorry for the long post, but at this point I need to let out my thoughts

I am just so tired of constantly being betrayed, being lied to, being used and then discarded later. I don't know what's the point in trying so hard to become a better person, and be loving when it has to end up in disappointment, betrayals, backstab and lies? 

Full disclosure: I have my issues, I never was a good boyfriend. But I tried my best despite everything, I actually loved my last partner with everything I had, I never lied about how I felt about her. Even after everything ended badly (two people with BPD getting in a relationship was never a good idea in the first place), I still cared for her as a friend, it's just something of what I am as a person, I can't forget about the people I once loved. I kept tabs on her mental health as much as possible from her Reddit posts, I never talked about them with her because I knew she didn't want to talk about that stuff with me, I just did that so that I could offer some support if it came to it. A couple days back she posted on an advice subreddit about a medical issue that troubled her, and in it she mentioned that she never had any feelings for me at any stage, never found me attractive, and was just with me because she had no other option. This just completely shattered me, it fucking destroyed me and took me back to the hole I was trying so hard to run away from.

I had accepted everything that was wrong with me, I agreed on almost everything she said was wrong about me, and am actually working on those things to be a better person. But that revelation, it just worsened my self esteem issues. And when I confronted her about it, expressed how hurt I was and how it would have been better for me to hear this from her own mouth rather this way, I was rightly told how it was my fault for going through her Reddit (stupid ik, but I had requested her while parting ways that I would appreciate if she didn't post about me there because I can't going through her Reddit), what really hurt me was how she just said that it was a white lie, and if she would never say it to someone with bad self esteem issues.

I just don't understand why? It just hurts now to see how all the times I was told I didn't love enough, I was just trying to love someone who didn't even like me. I hate how this revelation has just numbed me so much that I can't be upset about it, lash out or atleast be able to fucking cry my heart out for once. I am just shattered to my core, I try so hard to be close to my emotional side, and everytime something like this happens and I am back to putting up walls all around me.

I wish I could atleast hate her for this, all there is disappointment and just forgetting every memory about her I have been cherishing during my bad times in a whiff. I hate pity more than anything and that was all that I was actually getting during the whole disaster of a relationship? It just keeps breaking me from the inside as all these traumas get buried deep inside me, breaking me apart piece by piece slowly.

I try so hard to keep on living, be better, overcome my issues and be the best person I can be, and keep on loving life. But it just seems like an impossible task, I don't know if I will ever be able to trust or love someone again. I am just so fucking scared that maybe the next time I get suicidal, I may not be able to hold myself back. It sucks to suffer like this, I just hope it stops soon, I really don't know how long can I keep fighting like this."
It hurts so much to feel so alone,7,mjgqxx,3,"I hate it. Everything seemed like it was getting better. Then suddenly it was worse than before. I wish I could find safety somewhere and in someone, like I did once before. I don't feel as if I have a home."
"Yearly, I hate my birthday post",11,mjg9t0,3,"I feel like my birthday always reminds me of how little people around me actually care. 

So I'm turning 25 this year, and I wanted to celebrate with dinner or something - so I started to ask people if they would be able to come, and most said no they wouldn't. It was either that or that they didn't know yet. Then there was the whole, I couldn't think past 5 people to even invite, because otherwise, it would be weird that I was inviting them. 

So yeah, every time April 1st rolls around, this whole month is wrapped in the gloom of my birthday being around the corner."

I'm working and full time in college and I'm just overwhelmed. I quite literally am falling apart. I also was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 on top of bpd and cptsd and whatever else my team of mental health professionals think I have. I didn't even hesitate to self harm and I feel awful. Anyway, rant over"
Does anyone else have a difficult time being an advocate for themselves?,15,mjfuq7,2,"Currently I work part-time and I'm doing college part-time. To many people this might seem ""easily manageable"" but for me it's getting really difficult. I've dropped out of college before and now at 28 I'm trying to finish my degree. I have classes 2 days a week and work 4 days a week. I really want to ask my boss to let me work 3 days a week instead. I'm scared to ask but my mental health needs a days off (along with my housework). 

It sucks when being an advocate for myself is hard! I end up dealing with things that make me uncomfortable or stressed. I'm so worried my boss is going to be mean to me or say no. I already get the feeling he doesn't like me. I'm a part-time employee so I'm trying to give myself some perspective on this reasonable request."
Keep using DBT skills,7,mjfucb,0,I recently finished my 6 month DBT program. I definitely didnt think it helped that much until I reflected on it and realized how much calmer and patient I am. Still not 'perfect' but much easier to be around. Anyway how do I keep using my skills and not relapse into who I was before? I want to keep getting better at handling myself and using the skills I learnt but I find it so hard without 'school'.
one sound too many,20,mjfkad,2,"man i hate when im in sensory overload and one (1) thing just sets me off   
i can just feel the rage about to explode and i hate it  
my roommate is putting the dishes away (very awesome!) but the sound of dishes clanging and it being louder than my video im watching just made me get so irritated. That and the bug in my room just made me want to explode (i didnt, i removed myself and closed my door)"
I'm feeling extremely alone and unable to speak to the people closest to me about my feelings,6,mjfk4y,0,"As per the title, I feel really alone. I almost feel like I'm in a box where no one can hear me and I can see people but they can't see me. Or like I'm watching myself type this message up. I've gone through DBT and built myself up to be able to function enough to get a job and talk to new people and make phone calls and all of that stuff. But communicating with the people closest to me during these episodes is the hardest thing ever because the guilt of putting my problems on anyone else is TOO overwhelming. (Especially recently, given my partner has recently attempted suicide and ended up on a ventilator - she's alive and physically well now but mentally she's still in the drains. My poor girl.) 

I feel like I have no outlet anymore. I'm very much a loner - but being a loner is something I'm happy with, I prefer to be by myself and not have many friends, unless they're able to understand that I'm not always able to be the super outgoing, fun and adventurous person that I can be. A gal gers tired you know? I just need to be able to let off some steam from time to time because once that bottle starts filling up, it's only going to explode and cause misery for anyone around. 

Any advice on how I can alleviate these thoughts and feelings without feeling guilty would be greatly appreciated!"
Is anyone else unable to know if they're dreaming or not ?,6,mjfblm,5,"I know it sounds kind of confusing but, for a few weeks now I can't tell a dream from reality. Like, last night I was dreaming I was texting someone, but then I woke up and saw I didn't text, only I didn't wake up and was still dreaming. So I decided to text them, and surprise surprise I woke up again and hadn't text, but I think I was still dreaming. It is like a cycle. I still woke up in the morning thinking I had send that text but I didn't. This as been happening me with all sorts of things and I feel like I'm going mad, I wake up tired and super confused.  I can't even trust my self at night smh, has anyone else experienced this ?"
maybe im not ok ?,1,mjex3y,1,"everything just be hurtin right now. i dont even know whats going on most of the fucking time. i just wake up and exist and try to get through the day and then get high to forget that i exist and do it all again the next day. except i ran out of weed  so now i cant get away from all those thoughts and shit and its just all here and i dont want it to be. i like know im not ok, but physically i am fine and i haven't been engaging in any self harm or anything so like i just need to stop being stupid and dramatic.  i think about how i wish i was bad enough to end up in the hospital sometimes so maybe i could get a break for a second, so class and work would be on pause for a fucking second and then maybe my problems would be valid to me.but also im literally fine, I've always been fine, but im not and no one notices because i hide it good. i just want a break from existence. but also im just being dramatic and dumb."
How long have you had BPD?,3,mjernq,6,"I'm wondering because about 75% of people with BPD will experience remission in 2-3 years. But well my BPD is not going anywhere and now my parents are holding it over my head that I should be better by now. I know, toxic, but I'm geniuenly curious how many of you are suffering with BPD and are being treated for longer than 2 years?"
"I ruined everything I had, but I'm not really sad about it",3,mjeoe9,0,"Me (27F) and my husband (29M) are together for 5,5 years. There were ups and downs, but I didn't really felt to run away from him. And if, it was those crazy daydreaming stories, that I do not want to be true. 

Past few month thanks to covid situation, it was really hard on my husband. He can't do his job (luckily he is fully paid), he can't do his hobby. Last two months was super hard, because he had tendonitis in his hands, so he cannot do nothing. He's gamer, and he could play. Torture for him. 

For me it was extremely hard, because I just didn't expose my emotions at all. I was diagnosed quiet BPD. Every emotion is bubbling inside me, instead of exposing it. So it hurts phisycally every single day. When I expose it, it's just...everything. When I'm sad, I'm crying so hard, that I cannot breathe, when I'm happy I laugh to tears, when I'm angry, I'm agressive...I think you know what I mean. So it's like constant anxiety, because when I do not expose it, it's just like fire inside, that hurts as hell. 

I managed it and I feel really good about myself. Few years ago it was so bad, that my emotional bursts were like every single day. And because I had so many emotions locked inside, I was always confused, what I'm feeling. It was hours, sometimes day, that I couldn't remember correctly, because it was just soo foggy. Now I can remember it and I can be moderately calm about it. I'm not agressive, or selfharming.

For past half year, I was just empty and didn't felt anything. I started to smoke weed more and more, to not feel anything at all. I wanted to be fully present for my husband in his dark times. He was sad all the time. And his responses are not crying, but being just ugly to me. Everything pissed him off, even if I was nice to him every single time and tried to communicate everything to support his needs...instead of mine. 

Our sex life is nonexistent. He is just not horny and I am horny all the time. I learned to just masturbate, watching porn. Sometimes there's sex, but I feel like hand, that he's using for masturbating, instead of his wife, that he loves. No foreplay, almost no touching, looking to his eyes...it's just sad. 

It was Thursday this week (today is 3th of April) and our common friend M asked my husband out. His girlfriend B introduced us and and since day we met, we felt that ""animal connection"". M is working in porn industry and he is just as horny and twisted as me. B is frigid and scared of sex.

My husband and M went to continue with hanging out in our house. We were drinking and after my husband went to bed, we was alone. We were talking at first, but something happened. We were discussing one kiss, that we had. My husband knows about it. But me and M interpreted this kiss differently. But from there, it was just blank horny mind, that was driven only by instincts. 

We were kissing each other, and just petting each other. Clothes were on and we were aware, that we cannot have sex. It was really nice. I felt like woman after really long time. He was so horny and me too. Everything was right and I just wanted to continue with it. After some time we split and went sleep each to different bed. 

After we wake up, we were with me and my husband talking just about random shit. B should come and I wanted to discuss it with my husband in privacy. But after party went through the night and B and V went to sleep to diferent room. But me and M were...just like we continued the night before, but much more intense. Clothes were on and I was aware of my rule. But I couldn't help myself and just touched him through his pants, he touched my breast and so on. It was really beautiful. 

We all discussed the possibility of sharing each others parnters lot of times. But each time we were against it. I am borderline and B is borderline too (I think, she diagnosed herself as ADHD, but I just see true BPD, maybe some comordibity, but I'm not an expert). So we didn't want to tempt anything.

Last two days were different. I just cannot think. It was such a long time, that I felt this animal hornyness, that I love. And my husband is scared of me that way, because sometimes I'm danger to him or myself. So I went vanilla past 5 years. 

I told my husband and he is reacting as he should. He's feeling betrayed. He would felt that way, if I tould him after the night that happened first. I shouldn't continue it the next night. Now he's thinking upstairs and I am in bedroom. I took lexaurin and smoke some weed to calm myself down. And it helped a lot. Still I'm feeling as a shit, but I should feel that way. 

I told him one thing, that I realised. I just need hardcore sex full of passion in my life. What I have with my husband sexually isn't enough, but almost everything else is great. We communicate with each other greatly, but still...sometimes I feel like I love my friend. Not my husband. 

It's just messed up. I'm messed up. I want to have this marriadge, but I just need to have option to have sex with someone, that actually enjoys sex. Not that it's only obligation. I just want passion in my life. Nothing more. And M is ideal for it. We have perfect love/hate relationship, we clicked in every single of our fetishes, and there's absolute no possibility, that I could possibly love him. I cannot respect him enough for it. He's just my annoying friend, with whom is possible to talk about porn in absolute open way. 

I need to wait. And if we will get divorce, I wouldn't be mad. Sad yes, angry that I spend 5,5 years with someone, that actually wants to be alone, but not mad. Maybe it will be good for me. But my plans for having a family would have to wait for some time...and maybe I'm just calm about it, because I have lexaurin and ton of THC inside of me. 

P.S.: I know, that I shouldn't smoke and drink as much. I know that taking lexaurin without prescription is not really good for me. I cannot be 100% abstinent in anything, I have agreement with my therapist about these things. This is too much, I know, but truly I'm glad that I didn't took anything worse, that we have ""archived"" for 4 years in our house."
I'm Destructive and Don't Think I can Change for a long time?,2,mjenxk,2,"I get angry so fast, and I start verbally lashing out and my poor bf has to take it all. I know it won’t be long before he leaves. My therapists always leave and my insurance left us in the dust, so I cannot get another therapist. Every time I try to change, my therapists go and I have no figure to aspire to. I get upset and I don't want to take it out on anyone else so I just eat, and it makes me happy- temporary. However, my bank account is suffering- idk what to do any advice?

TLDR: Yeah I know I’m a bitch, I’m trying to stop. Any advice?"
(M22) Would someone with BPD completely lie through of their teeth constantly if it meant you would feel better about them in a certain way?,0,mjea0k,21,My girlfriend (F22) has BPD. Lately this week she’s been extremely lazy and she’s not getting any exercise. She knows I don’t really appreciate it when she’s lazy. She thinks she’s fat (she’s not) and has constant fears that I will leave her because of that (I won’t) She tells me she’s been going for 30 min morning jogs for the last 3 days. When I go and see her it doesn’t seem like she’s moved at all. Would she lie to me?
Fighting,11,mje07l,8,"Hey.
 
Does anyone else have a hard time not being able to stop preventing a fight with someone? A friend? Partner? Or anyone? 
Like you don't know why you suddenly became so angry and it (you) always end up making a mess? Do I make sense? Do you understand? 

And if you do, how do you cope? How do you ""act opposite""? And is there any tips on how to actually try to prevent the fight from happening?

I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I'm so lost and the fighting is causing so many unnecessary fights and drama in my life, like I don't have enough of that already."

Is it wrong to ask my bf to not go to a certain gym?,1,mjdvbk,3,"My boyfriends ex works out at the gym I work out at and my boyfriend has been thinking about going to the same gym. But I don’t feel comfortable with it. Am I wrong for feeling uncomfortable and wanting to ask him not to go to this gym? He doesn’t like gyms anyway as he likes to focus on calisthenics, swimming and running. But it truly does make me very uncomfortable."
DAE get intrusive thoughts about stabbing/punching/harming those you love when they make you feel abandoned?,2,mjdrio,5,"First of all I have no intention, nor do I ever have the intention, of harming those I love. I do however get intrusive thoughts about stabbing and punching them. Is this a common BPD trait or is this something else? I’m scared to talk to my doctor incase they deem me a threat to others, because I really don’t think I am. I love those close to me with all my heart and the idea of them being hurt sickens me. I just want to understand these invasive thoughts. Would really appreciate any advice."
I think I was misdiagnosed with bipolar 🙃,0,mjdqf6,8,"So I was diagnosed with bipolar Bipolar when I was 17. Iv recently gone back to therapy after A very toxic marriage was over. I am a very self aware person (almost to the point where it drives me insane) Iv read that with BPD mood swings are trigger by events whereas bipolar is more random... I would 100% say that I am triggered by events or interactions with people. A phone vibrating while I’m hanging out with my person as an example: I immediately start to feel this lump in my throat and I get anxious and fearful it’s something bad or someone they shouldn’t be texting and I shut down. I am constantly suspicious of everyone’s motives around me..relationships, friends, coworkers, etc... it’s like I just see red flags everywhere when people speak or interact with me and I over analyze EVERYTHING to look for those red flags. My feelings for people can turn on and off so quickly. Usually I date someone for a month or two then they say or do something even small that I read into too much then feelings are gone and not recoverable for a period of time. I fall HARD and QUICK for people then it’s like it slowly simmers out as I find little things I see as a red flag, BUT then I can’t cut it off... like I don’t want them but also don’t want them to leave either... 🙃It doesn’t help that my ex husband was extremely abusive mentally, sexually, and sometimes physically. I can’t tell if I just have CPTSD or if I’m presenting with BPD. Has anyone else been misdiagnosed with bipolar first? Or have any similar experiences? I understand nobody is a medical professional and just looking to see if anyone can relate to my situation. Thank you! ❤️"
Think of yourself as “in recovery”,9,mjdfyp,0,"Last year I did a stint in-patient and have since gotten on meds, gotten a therapist and stopped self-medicating with weed. I’ve cut my outbursts down to almost none at all (yay!), but I’ve struggled with major anxiety and depression since. My therapist tells me to think of myself as “in recovery,” which is something I try to remember when I’m feeling overwhelmed. In recovery means everything doesn’t have to be perfect. In recovery means I’m still on the road to feeling better. In recovery means I have a disorder that I’m still learning to control."
"I wish I had more friends but at the same time I don't want to get to know ""new"" people and I feel like I won't have enough time/energy to keep more relationships (friendships). Feeling bad about it cause I'm afraid I'm sabotaging myself..",5,mjdeup,0,"Alrighty so I have 1 male bestfriend and 1 female bestfriend. He honestly is my FP and I got to admit I spend most of the time with him and he's always on my mind. He lives nearby and I care about him a LOOOOT. My female bestfriend lives in an other town and we don't see each other that often anymore since she moved there and she's very busy with school. 

I had to put my school at pause for 1,5 year now and next September I'm going to resume my nursing graduation year. I don't have any groups of friends and since I'm not going to school anymore, and I work in teams with older nurses, I'm not in a great situation to spontaneously make new friends. 

My FP has lots of friends, different groups of friends and lots of social contacts. My female bestfriend is such a sweetheart, I absolutely adore her and I'm ashamed to say I recently started to feel a bit jealous of her.. We're very much alike and we understand each other so well it's like she's my long lost twin. She's going to artschool and she gained new friendships and is very busy getting to know the people from school and gets in contact with new people trough what they have in common: making art. I'm so so proud of her and so happy for her but at the same I'm ashamed to admit I'm a little bit jealous. 

I don't mind that she has less time for me and I don't even feel like I'm being replaced. I'm jealous cause we both used to only have each other, and now that she's gaining more friendships and getting to know more like-minded people, and I see all the fun she's having on Instagram, I feel like I'm failing.. I know I shouldn't compare myself to anyone but i just feel lost on where to find LIKE MINDED friends, non judgemental people, since it's covid + I'm not going to school (+the class I started with all graduated already) +at work there's no one of my age. 

I always felt like I was destined to be a loner, just have 1 or 2 friends.. I never really cared about it and to be honest I'd rather be with my FP all the time than having multiple friends I have to divide my time between. But I feel like I'm missing out or like I'm sabotaging myself into feeling like I'm not worthy of having friendships/being social. I'm afraid I'm keeping myself into the comfortzone and it might be better for me to shift my focus, find more friends so I can become a little less dependent on my FP.

Not sure if this is just a rant but any reply would be welcome. I could use some advice, recognition, anything. Tell me how you deal with this or if you even deal with this at all. Either way, thank you very much for reading and I'm sorry if this story gave you a headache cause English ain't my native language lol."
should i leave?,3,mjdeaj,2,"
my bpd is really triggered by one of my friendships. 
he treats me well and i don’t act out in front of him so there’s not really a problem to “fix”. 

however the pain doesn’t get any easier. i’m in a dbt group and it’s better than nothing but i still struggle every day with suicidal thoughts that are triggered by our relationship and feeling abandoned, worthless, disposable, etc. 

is my only option to leave him? or do i keep hoping that eventually i’ll be able to deal with it? i have no idea what to do. i don’t want to feed into the “leave before getting left” belief but i also know that my mental health has been negatively affected by our relationship. what do you guys do in this situation?"
I just got diagnosed with BPD and it’s already getting used against me.,10,mjd9iw,7,"My therapist diagnosed me with BPD a couple days ago. I told my family and significant other. I thought they would be supportive, and also just wanted to share that. I had been questioning if I had it for a while. 

My family now tells me i’m “splitting” whenever someone genuinely upsets me, and my significant other would say the same thing. He also told me when I was upset that it’s my “BPD acting up”

Is this a common thing? I didn’t think they were going to define me by this. It feels extremely bad."
"In a moment of fear and desperation, I asked my live-in ex to get back with me. I now fully regret it.",1,mjcxu6,0,"He is a selfish  cheater, semi narcissist in his own ways. It had a big hand in making me eventually verbally abusive from snapping mentally. So He/we are toxic. He has never seen ME break up with him nor immediately NOT run back back to him. He was taken aback how I ran off to my brother’s for a few weeks to cool off and never called him

When I came back  he was being way way way too nice. He didn’t ask to be back with me but it was clear he was buttering me up. In that moment I got weak. He looked so handsome. I wanted his warmth and I wanted security. Basically all the wrong reasons to fall for him again. But I was impulsive + I realized I would face living in the projects which are pretty awful, I cried to him &  blamed his ways on myself and promised to do better (ie. be a doormat) and asked if he wanted to work things out.He looked so happy and relieved and also said he was sorry for being a liar. He was on the brink of tears and looked at me as if thinking 
“Omg maybe she really will change this time and omg I love her”

He said happily
“Ok well let’s see” 
as in he really wants to but needs to see if I changed (hahahaaha like as if I’m all to blame and am the only one who needs change) 

But soon after I felt like I gave back my power to him, let myself be re-shackled to him, to this lonely golden cage. Here I have no immediate needs that cannot be met. He is happy to provide. But he also becomes UNhappy if I express unhappiness about his selfish habits, lack of romance, lying ways, and evidence of cheating. Most especially he is annoyed at me for being traumatized and resentful by it all 

All I can think to do, is never mention  anything about getting back together again. Say nothing. Ask for nothing more other than essentials. Work on getting ssi and housing, and split. 

Because I know what ultimately makes him happy is me not talking much when he gets home, not asking for much, not expecting romance or exciting dates or conversations. He just wants an invisible housewife"
I cut him off *Small win*,17,mjcrrq,5,"I've posted about my ex previously but deleted the posts due to being embarrassed, but in short, we were together for 9 years in total and I broke down and contacted him yesterday. I'm embarrassed that I did as I was doing so well after two months of no contact. So down we went into our toxic pattern of saying how much we missed each other and he told me how sorry he was for the abuse over the years and I felt myself slipping. Dreaming of our wedding again, planning what our children would look like, growing old with him and then suddenly I stopped myself I said enough is enough. I explained to him the morning that I wished him well, was grateful for his apology and told him that I wouldn't be contacting him again and proceeded to block him off of everything, and removed all ways in which I could contact him. Usually, I would have let this carry on for weeks or even months until he hurt me again physically or sexually, but I decided enough was enough. I deserved more than what we were giving each other and I wanted to be free of the relationship. 

It's only something small but honestly knowing I had the power in me to do that is making me feel as though I'm getting somewhere, slowly but surely! I just want everyone to know that if I can make progress I'm so sure that all of you can and I'm so grateful for all of the support I've received from this forum"
I thought I was doing better but now I’m splitting again.. (TW),1,mjckg1,0,"TW for self harm

Hi guys. It’s been a while. I was doing okay. Pretty good, actually! But now things are spiraling again.

My ex and I broke up because he was toxic, manipulative, and tried to use me on so many occasions. We were long distance, but he introduced me to one of his long distance friends.

Her and I hit it off so well! And she’s so accepting of my coexisting mental problems (primarily OSDD) and has never been rude or anything about it. And she says I’m a wonderful friend and gives me all these compliments!

But now I feel like she’s becoming distant? Things have been hard for her recently, and I’ve been supporting her to the best of my ability. However, our conversations are becoming shorter over the last two days, and now I’m getting very very scared. She’s been acting off. And she won’t open up to me. I know my ex has been >!cutting himself regularly, and posts about it in his statuses!<.

Now, BPD brain has come to the conclusion that she hates me and does not want to talk to me ever again. So now I’m getting really scared. I didn’t know she was my FP until now. I didn’t know I became so dependent.

Why am I like this? I’m so scared. And so angry. Why can’t she just love me (platonically) like I love her? Is there an underlying reason for this? Why am I so illogical? I don’t understand anymore! I want to know peace but I’m panicking. She’s the only friend I have who’s inclusive and doesn’t care about the personality disorder shit."
Ever written a letter to your parents?,1,mjc9qk,5,"Has anyone written a letter or something to their parents or parent explaining everything that’s frustrated you?

I’ve tried to explain to him how hard it is to even live another day and after my od a few months ago he for the first time in my life said that I’m going through a lot more than him....it’s like it took me almost killing myself for him to get it. 

I don’t know I wonder if I wrote all my thoughts and even 10% of my worries and problems would he actually care then...?

I do remember him telling me to stop in a few text. I am having a lot of guilt and shame right now and I’m afraid to go back and read all the mean things I’m sure I said.

because I have had to explain to her a million and one times that I don’t like doing things like this and it’s like she doesn’t listen. 

I’m even worse at saying no so now it’s like I have to really change nothing but everything about my day so she can come over. Is my
room clean enough? Should I wear socks? Put lotion on? I have no groceries yet what if she gets hungry and wants to go out to eat? I don’t wanna do that??? THIS is why it’s so hard for me to switch up my day. My brain goes into overdrive."

"The past two years broke me, but I am rebuilding! [TW: ED/SD -mentioned vaguely]",16,mjaqqh,16,"So I've gone through hell the past few years. I was raped in 2019, while the love of my life was deployed. My heart was shattered as I was abandoned, and left alone as my world crumbled beneath my feet. My mom got very sick, and my Dad was diagnosed with a deadly form of cancer.

Self harming became extreme, my anorexia deeply formed and solidified, to the point I was a walking skeleton. April 2020, I was in a bad car accident that hurt me pretty badly, enough that I am still injured and feel pain, a year later. It took extreme levels of agony to be able to be able to stand unaided again, much less walk and move. It was hell, and extremely painful, and is a daily battle. My next relationship helped the anorexia, but deepend my self-hatred and unhappiness. Gaslit, and mentally tortured me. When I left, choosing homelessness over the 80 days of abuse he put me through...  He went insane. Held me hostage in a car. Stole everything I owned, including my dying cat. Which he stole and kept, until I was given her corpse back by the vet. Stalking, nothing shy of mental torture. Attempts at blackmail and extortion. Identity theft.... And god I can't even begin to list how many times he broke the restraining order by contacting me. Over 100 times! Destroyed various friendships of mine, and almost destroyed my relationship with my dying father. (Thank god my Dad is smarter than him.) He has been hellbent on ruining my life for no reason other than misplaced rage and spite, enough that I fled over 700 miles for my safety. I was borderline suicidal, and had given up on life. Enough that October 2020 I attempted to take my own life for the tenth time in my life. I saw no reason to exist.

Now I weigh a healthy amount, and have maintained it since November of 2020. I still don't eat daily, but... Mostly. I'm more happy I have kept on weight. I can work on proper eating habits later. 

I have not cut myself since October 2020. Have no had another suicide attempt since then, although truthfully I have had a few thoughts, in various bad moments.

I'm working on my car, and traveling issues and anxieties after the accident. Working on my social anxiety too, which has been extremely bad. (Yay covid vaccine and mindful social distancing to protect everyone else!) 

My body image issues are hell, but I am finally embracing myself, and my beauty. And learning how to begin to accept and love myself. It's hard as fuck... But so worth all of the work I've put into it. I love being able to feel pretty. It's a **lot** nicer than feeling disgusted with myself any time I tried to make myself look nice.

I have been able to build myself the start of a job I love more than I can describe, and being my own boss is highly helpful, because I can work around my mental health requirements. I am working towards getting insurance, so I can go and get a therapist, because I absolutely need one. But just because I have one doesn't mean I don't practice mindfulness or work on DBT and self-betterment. 

And working especially on my trust issues. Every day is a challenge, and work. And yes, I slip and fuck up sometimes... But I'm proud of the progress I have made. I've worked hard, and have come a very long way.

I still have so much work ahead of me. And I can't wait to apply myself. I forgot how wonderful, and beautiful actually *healing* is."

I only make this post to express myself
I'm (F 20y.o) from France, it's hard for me to talk in english but I'll try my best.. I've been struggling my all life with mental health like anorexia nervosa and bulimia, ED in general but with anxiety and depression.
I'm in my second year in psychology at university, mounts ago we saw personality disorder. My depression became worst at this time, but I started to be able to describe more precisely my symptoms. I started to see a psychiatrist and a psychologist, they diagnose me a depression (not surprised) and dissociative disorder. But I know that there's something else and everyday I discover some things that I forgot and the list goes on..
But when I see your sub I feel like everyone knows what it feel like everyday to live..?"
Does anybody else find most people extremely boring?,569,mj9ytt,80,"They can be super lovely people, very interesting in the “ordinary sense” but I’m still just super bored. 

There’s maybe only 2 people in my life I don’t find boring or struggle to keep a conversation with/flow. 

I manage it and just ask questions to get answers, so it’s not an issue with me being unable to communicate, I just find them and the interactions boring? Like I’d just rather not talk. 

Does anybody else struggle with this? 

Thankyou!!"
How do you learn to stop taking things so personally?,37,mj9c1g,7,"I really need to learn that someone not replying to me for a while does not mean they don’t like me they might just be busy

and i need to stop crying all the time about my relationship.

So any advice would be great but I’m really close to killing myself and some advice would be great"
Instagram asked if i wanted help because i searched for bpd hashtags?,6,mj99g4,4,"I typed in bpd on the search bar and then clicked on the bpd hashtag that said it had 1.3 Million posts and then a message from instagram said ""Can we help? Posts with words or tags you're searching for often encourage behaviour that can cause harm and even lead to death. If you're going through something difficult, we'd like to help."" Now I don't know if that has come up because maybe instagram is tracking what I search(I watch alot of true crime documentaries and people have instagram accounts about the crimes and they have interesting posts on there so i search up the names of the crimes or criminals) or is has it come up just because instagram believes bpd is a dangerous subject to talk about. Can someone help?"
Feeling loved and cared about in hospital.,1,mj992q,1, I am a borderline and bipolar person who just recently started having trouble with si and sh. And I just realized why I was hoping from hospital to hospital. I feel more cared for in a hospital then I do at home or at college. Do any other borderlines feel this way?
"I feel like the world is out to get me, even though I don’t do anything these days...",1,mj91yy,1,"Just getting this off my chest. I’ve had the worst adolescence/young adult life & I am constantly feeling like I cannot grow because of the things that happened, & continue to happen, to me. 

• 2013-15 (age 15-18) I was in a turbulent relationship that ended just before my 18th birthday on an interstate trip because my boyfriend broke my trust about drugs, something that was kind of hard to do considering we did the same drugs. I was toxic that whole relationship, cheated on him & self-harmed in front of him. Was a raging alcoholic. 

• 2015-16 I dated several boys that I completely fucked over in various ways due to alcoholism & undiagnosed BPD, but also am dealing with being abused by my work place which is causing me to panic, & not getting paid. 

• 2016-18 I moved countries & had multiple turbulent relationships there, burnt out, suicidal & drinking. All this time I’ve been actively self-harming. Get kicked out of familiy’s place in foreign country, feel left out & fucked up. Come back to my home country after being fired from my job for shaving my head. 

• 2017 I fall in love with a boy but fuck it up by overstaying my welcome & he’s really immature. He is my FP. I decide to start healing. It’s rocky but I’m trying now. Every day I imagine us together & it *hurts*

• 2017 I am raped by a tinder date. I start dating a different boy & completely settle down, thinking he is my refuge of stability. 

• 2018 I spend some time in the psych ward for being chronically suicidal. Get fired/quit from my job on a day I nearly killed myself by a girl who is financially abusing me.** still obsessing over fantasy of FP who I have no contact with

• 2019 Discover I’m polyamorous & he doesn’t understand. I cheat on him, but it’s different this time. It’s with my FP from 2017, & he’s matured beyond belief. 

• 2019 we move in together, we’re in love it’s great 

• 2020 abusive housemates, a friend leaves his girlfriend, my best friend, dying of an overdose in my house because he broke up with her after she got psychosis. I took her in. She threw it in my face along with another girl who abused my household that I ended up butting heads with. I start dating the idiot who ditched dying girl in my house. He turns out to be a narcissist & abuses, gaslights & cheats on me** with the girl who financially abused me 

• 2020 my cat dies just after his 1st birthday. I have feelings that it’s my fault as it’s the only time he’s been out at night that long (I really tried to get him in but he wouldn’t come, & when he was coming in... was hit by a car. I cried for 3 days.) 

• 2021...... still suicidal & terrified of almost everything except my boyfriend & being here in my house. Constantly there’s little fights or drama I get brought into because of my kind heart, not my BPD. I feel so lost & alone. I have no money to heal with my community at events etc.. I am so suicidal all the time. 


I can only take so much. & these are only the major events. Childhood was bad. I’m currently in therapy & trying to get diagnosed as autistic, instead of BPD. I feel misunderstood."
Advice?,2,mj8wwv,4,"I'm diagnosed BPD and I don't have ADHD but I've been taking Adderall recreationally every now and then and when I do, it's like I don't have BPD anymore. I feel completely in control of my emotions and I don't dissociate at all. I want to talk to my doctor about it but I don't know how to tell him I've been taking it recreationally or if I even should tell him.

Any advice would be appreciated"
Am I the only one that finds it extremely hard to make friends?,7,mj8uoq,7,"Goodmorning Guys and Girls hope your morning is going great.. I'm 23 but yet in the past I can never hold onto friendships. Because it's like I'm always there for them and I text first all the time. But if I stop texting people first I won't hear from those people in a whole month.
Then I'll text them with extremely mad and sad because I just don't understand why you wouldn't just say you don't want to talk to me. It's extremely difficult to make friends especially ones that understand BPD."
HOW do I shut off my idealization?,1,mj8u7t,1,"I have a huge problem in idealizing people I want as partners. I had this issue with my last ex where nothing he could do would be wrong. I would excuse awful behaviors, and he would treat me like crap. I told myself he was misunderstood, or I would just rationalize bad behavior. 
I wanted to move onto something new after a year of trying to find happiness in myself and I met someone who actually SHOWED me they were a good person. Turns out, he is a master at lying and has a girlfriend of over 3 years and has a whole plan laid out to get away with it. This is someone I was friends with for over 10 years so it was a huge bummer to be let down as a friend, have my trust shattered, my health at risk, and honestly — what I should see as the end of the entire thing. I should not put up with someone who treats me this way, and if he wanted something more like I did, starting a relationship on lies and with cheating is just not happening.
So why do I struggle so much with ending this? I keep telling myself the same crap I told myself with my ex. Maybe he is misunderstood, maybe he’s too shy to end it with her, maybe I am misunderstanding something too.. like maybe he was always a piece of shit and I am just so caught up in my head creating false hopeful realities I missed it. 
I had my ex tell me once I never listen to him. he said that I seem like I do but then spin it my way. and I know he is right on that. How in the world do I stop this?

I never devalue people either. I just kind of give up after some point in time but sadly *in the past* i would take them back. new me is not doing that, but I just can’t stand how I put people on a pedistal and I never mean anything to them, even though they make me feel that way."
Everyone seems to think that I'm just exaggerating?,1,mj8rsy,2,"I've been dealing with moderate to severe mental health issues for 5 to 6 years now. I struggled with bulimia, severe long depression, anxiety, self harm, suicidal ideation etc... since about 6 month ago I've had tics. The tics kind of gradually started and become a lot more noticeable once I started to acknowledge them.

I feel like whenever I try and talk to anyone about my mental health symptoms, especially my closest friends, they just don't answer me and avoid the conversation? They seem to think I am just reading into all these different conditions and that's why I am still unwell. They clearly think I am just exaggerating and wanting to be unwell. 

I find it extremely upsetting to be confronted with that, because one of my biggest triggers is feeling invalidated and misunderstood. 
Yes I do read into many conditions, and yes probably I wouln't dwell on things as much if I didn't.... but I am reading into them because I have all these issues that no-one seems to get?
I feel like they all just want me to stop talking about it and that makes me feel completley isolated. I feel like no-one gets that I am really stuggeling with all these things, I am not just making it up? 

Well, I mean maybe they are right and I should just stop making my mental health much of a focus. I just feel like it is such a big part of me and it seems to consume so much of my life, I wouln't know how to shut it out without making things worse?

I am honestly really doubting myself right now and couln't really use some perspective."
will someone ever love us as much as we love them?,100,mj7usi,63,"i feel like (and know) i am more into my boyfriend than he is into me. i know he likes me a lot, but its with the small things i can just tell it isnt as much as i love him. is this bad?? is this how i’ll always feel?"
"I feel like I can’t connect with anyone, even those close to me.",3,mj7r6d,2,"(26F) I‘m struggling so much with feeling entirely disconnected from everyone in my life, and I don’t know what to do. I have weekly therapy. I recently had a 6 week inpatient stay. I’ve changed my meds. I’ve had TMS. I maybe (?) have autism; my psychiatrist puts my symptoms down to BPD, depression and dissociative episodes. 

This is a disconnected post, sorry. 

I’m in a 6-year (polyam) relationship with my BF who has a GF of 1 year. We previously all dated, but her feelings for me faded and now she’s primarily with him, even though the three of us spend most our time together in the same house. I feel like an alien, like I’m invisible. 

It feels like I’m angry at everyone all the time, like I can’t tolerate anyone - and at the same time I feel so disconnected. It’s like I’m putting up a wall that no one can see. Everyone reassures me they love me, my BF says he wants to be with me. His GF says she loves me too. People reach out to me frequently. I get praised for my work. I’m doing a PhD. 

I don’t reply to anyone because it feels like I can’t; I feel nothing about the relationships I have with people and then just continue to let them die. I want to feel some sort of desire to talk to people, to have some sort of ability to maintain a community. 

I’m so sick of feeling empty. Why can’t I connect to people? It feels like I could pick up and live my life alone in an instant and nothing could change. I feel so alone and alien. It’s almost like I don’t exist. I want to feel alive. 

It feels like the only things I have to make me feel alive are sex, disordered eating behaviours and SH. I don’t have the former beside my libido evaporated years ago thanks to meds. Thanks to therapy I no longer have those other coping mechanisms in my everyday life - the result being that I have nothing that helps me connect to the world. So what the hell do I do?"
Taking out triggers on FP (21F) DAE/how to manage,3,mj7gd8,4,"Ok so first up I wanna clarify that I’ve never done anything physically harmful to my partner, I don’t yell or throw things at him or anything explosive. 

I do however get into constant low sulky moods where I’ll tell him that he’s being mean in a kind of jokey way, or get frustrated and grumpy if he’s not giving me the type of attention I want/trying to do or watch something without me. 

It’s like something will happen to make me feel some sorta way and in my head he should know that that thing happened and that I’m upset without me even having to tell him. 

We both work late hours in tiring jobs and he does a lot of the cooking and caring for my dog. I know that my behaviour weighs on him a lot but in the moment I just never realise I’m doing it. 

Does anyone have any advice about managing/recognising this typa behaviour? Thanks guys I love you ❤️"
i feel like i won’t make it if my s/o leaves,1,mj711a,2,"I’m 16 and although you can’t be officially diagnosed with BPD until you’re 18, I’ve been told by many mental health professionals that I have the disorder and I have been receiving treatment for the disorder since I was 14. I’ve also been with my boyfriend (long distance until just recently when he moved in with me). Ever since 5 months into our relationship, I’ve felt like if he leaves me or something happens to our relationship that i’ll have to pass away. It tears me up inside to think about it and it’s my biggest fear. I’m so young and these feelings are so overwhelming and I just want to know if anyone else relates...I don’t know how to explain the feeling but it’s almost unbearable and makes me want to end my life now.I have anxiety attacks over it pretty often I don’t think I could live life without him nor would I ever want to. But yeah all I really want to know is if this is normal?"
Anyone live multiple narratives at once/how does your BPD affect you?,6,mj6wl6,8,"Title.

I have multiple shifting, but still stable senses of self.

My BPD is based of identity shifting, rage, and dissociation, that is more in relation to DID, except it's identities and not full blown personalities.

I've come to notice that BPD, DID and ASPD in terms of the identity aspect have a lot in common, they just manifest in different ways.

What other people's most prominent symptoms and how do they affect you?"
Whats your reason to go on living with NPD/BPD?,3,mj6vjy,3,"Why do you guys feel life is worth living? I have a diagnosis of NPD and BPD and I’ve been having trouble accepting that my life is still worth living. My current therapist “doesn’t do diagnosis” but I know I have cluster B (typically cycling between presentations but usually more vulnerable). It is clear to me that this is the problem and I even had it confirmed by my previous psych when I asked him point blank. My current therapist is just trying to help me improve by not focusing on it and I really am doing my best to trust him, but I can’t stop myself from focusing on the fact that I have NPD and BPD. Anytime I try to shift my focus on my childhood like he wants (he is more into cPTSD angle which I get) when I remember that I have these issues I feel so deeply ashamed and embarrassed and like it is a cop out for me to ignore it. I always thought the point of life was to love each other and to try and make the world a more fair and equal place. The older I get, the more I realize that this is my disorders talking. My NPD tells me the world is not good and that I / everyone need to try and fix it even though it is an impossible task, and my BPD tells me the only point of life otherwise is to love others when really I should be loving myself. Ironically, i have a paraphilia for weight gain that makes it extremely difficult (impossible) for me to have fulfilling intimate relationships and enjoy normal sex. I have had many relationships but they have all been rough and I am unable to connect or get pleasure intimately which partners do not like long term even though I get them off physically. I also cannot in good faith have kids for obvious reasons, which makes me sad but I can handle that. I am beginning to realize that healthy people seem to be living life for the purpose of enjoying the moment, chasing dreams, and just being happy discovering and being who they are. I am not able to enjoy these activities as is. I am bogged down by constantly trying to fix myself so that I can do these things and blend in to live a normal life but the fight seems impossible. It is my understanding that particularly narcissism is not treatable and that my physical brain is wired to be this way and unlikely to change. My previous psych said yeah you meet criteria for NPD but we can’t do much to fix it and wanted to focus on other things instead. I don’t see what the point of living is if I am a narcissist. I am deeply disturbed by this and I hate myself for it even though I understand cognitively it is not my “fault” I feel it is my responsibility to fix. I am so bothered that i can’t fix it and humiliated to be this type of monster so I try and hide from the world but it is really hard to be so alone and ashamed all the time. I want to kill myself because I know I am a monster, but I don’t want to be selfish and killing myself seems like the most narcissistic thing I could do really which defeats the purpose. I am struggling to come up with a reason to live other than that it would be bothersome to others if I killed myself, but I also feel that my existence is harmful just being here sucking up oxygen and burdening others like some sort of monster. I am wondering what other people who have these disorders focus on as a reason to live or a purpose I guess in these circumstances and how you cope with accepting that narcissism is not possible to change? I’m sorry to ask this here, I tried posting on narcissist Reddit but they do not accept posts like this because they consider it harassment to refer to narcissism as a problem. I know there is a lot of overlap and a lot of people with dual diagnosis in cluster B so I just thought I’d see if anyone here has any advice."
Boundaries around opposite-sex friendships,2,mj6lu1,21,"Ok, if you ever read my posts I have huge fear from my bf having female friends. It is a trigger that totally destroys me.

I would be happy to get any ideas, suggestions of how to cope and establish boundaries in this aspect.

&#x200B;

What I want: No female friends. Maybe I am okay with some who are not super close with him and are not attractive. Still, it would be a trigger but it wouldn't disable me. lol.

What he wants: keeping all his female friends, who he seems to have many and many of them are also attractive. Basically, he doesn't want any limitations.

&#x200B;

How could we find a common ground when we are basically on the opposite sides of the spectrum?

Please, any tips are appreciated!

&#x200B;

Edit: i am in therapy since i am 12 and i do it intensively with a therapist specialized in BPD for 1.5 years. I needed to add this info since multiple comments suggested to get help. I already am in therapy.

Edit2: i don't have male friends because i don't find it appropriate for me either to have close guy friends. i am not letting guys close to me as they usually hit on me."
What can I do to rekindle things with an ex,0,mj6lf1,4,"So it’s been about a year since my ex broke up with me because of my poor communication and her not feeling valued enough, her feeling like she made all the effort, And I became a push over. I believe these things are fixable and I want to put them right. I’ve been working on them since we have been apart.

However I’m not sure how I can restart it with her. We have spoken a couple of times even on the phone and they have all been quite pleasant. But I get the feeling that she’s a bit standoffish, sometimes she’s interested and asks questions or initiates the conversation but often I find she’s a bit short with her answers and doesn’t try. I don’t blame her I just think she doesn’t want to get hurt and I completely understand that. 

So I’m wondering if anyone here would have any advice on how I could improve my current relationship with her get her to open up a little without seeming desperate or forceful? 

I’m currently stuck in a different country waiting for hotel quarantine to end so meeting up isn’t really an option."
Being in a poly relationship and dealing with abandonment,4,mj6dy6,2,"I often feel i can't do it anymore, but I'm fixated and obssesed. I spend my time in the most stupid and unhealthy ways. Just looking at his social media or of the women he pursuit. I'm tired that everything detonates my fear of abandonment. I live in fight or flight. I'm constantly telling him i  can't no longer do it because he doesn't make me feel safe. When we are together things are great, loving and fun but when I'm not around him everything collapses and i just want to hate him. I wish i could like someone else but I'm obssesed and i can't even look at anyone but him. I'm thinking about moving to another country so i can let him go."
BPD. Heightened actions/cute aggression.,0,mj5s0s,10,"So I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend, who also turns out to be my fp.I have a tendency to bite him every time I'm in a very good mood or fun mood. I've noticed it happens more when my mood is heightened.Sometimes it's even hard for me to control it and I tend to hurt him at times, but he's understanding and we tend to laugh about it.Researching this, I found out about something called ""cute aggression"", and I guess it would make sense that as I have BPD, I experience it more often?Is anyone else experiencing it, or am I the only one who acts like this when I feel happy, energetic and positively heightened?"
BPD struggling with hobbies/alone time.,6,mj5j5u,4,"It's hard for me to remember what I used to do and how I spent my free time, before I got in a relationship with my boyfriend.   
We're very close and moved in together quite fast, but he knows about my bpd and is very understanding, also I'm working hard on my bpd, so our relationship is going very great!  
However, we spend a lot of time together and I'm okey with that, because he's my fp, but he needs his free time too.   
I understand that and want to cooperate with him in this, but I'm struggling to find new hobbies or how to spend time alone enjoyably. Things bore me out quickly and I don't know how to push myself to try new things. More so I don't even know what to try.  
Any recommendations on hobbies and how to enjoy my time alone?"
Intrusive thoughts about partner/relationship,2,mj4zgg,3,"I really feel like I need to share this somewhere because this is killing me. Share your thoughts in the comment section if you can relate!

I’ve been together with my boyfriend for a year now and find myself smothered with intrusive thoughts related to extreme jealousy and insecurity. This has been an ongoing problem for me for years since my first relationship.

The thoughts might revolve around my boyfriends past relationships, his female friends and my fear of not being lovable or attractive enough. These are just a few examples though. I feel like ANYTHING can trigger an intrusive thought like this. It can go on for weeks at a time and I feel absolutely drained and miserable and anxious. 

Everytime he goes out with his friends or I see a notification from a female friend of his on his phone screen, I most likely get an anxiety attack and have to put all my energy into getting the anxiety under control so that I could go on with my life. And it. Takes. Forever.

I try my absolute best to not be a toxic partner and I try to either hide these things from him or to express myself as healthy and nice as possible if I feel the extreme need to. 

I hate how jealous I can get. I would never let it take over my actions, but the emotion inside me just kills me and it’s literally hell. I don’t personally know anyone who would relate to this. 

I’ve been starting to consider breaking up with him for my BPD. Being in a relationship gives me so much anxiety, but I really love him and he loves me so I feel like I can’t just give up."
DAE also mirror down to even the littles things.,0,mj4ltg,0,"edit: i meant littlest, sorry

ive realized that whoever my FP is, my identity issues get worse. When i am not attached to someone, i still don’t know myself but there’s also less feelings and stress involved so it’s kind of just sitting there. With an FP, i literally become them. down to the amount of time i’m supposed to wait until i respond. if they like to message all day, i will like to message all day. if they like to be independent and only message me sometimes, i will convince myself that that is how i am also. i cannot decide anything for myself and i hate it. 

I will say, however, from my previous relationship onto this one i’ve stopped lying. I mean about ... “do you like carrot cake?” and i’d maybe say.. yes i love it. When really ive never had it. I’m proud of myself for this because i used to do that all the time so ensure that my FP and i were on the same track always. But i don’t know how to stop the other thing. 

It’s also i feel that whatever their love language is, mine automatically is the same, and then i question if it really is... and it’s a cycle. you know."
"Started therapy, feels like I don’t need it anymore after breakup",3,mj4g00,5,"I’ve recently started therapy after waiting for so long to get accepted. Around the same time I broke up with my then boyfriend and started new medication which works great.

Getting over him was so much easier than I thought and things have only been going up since then. 

The problem now is: I only have issues with my BPD during relationships which means I’m sitting in therapy and she is asking me if I thought about hurting myself again and other stuff. I didn’t. That’s great, no self harm anymore. No arguments that get way too heated. Nothing.

But how can I get help for my future me now that I don’t have ANY issues at the moment? I can’t explain my therapist anything anymore now that I feel alright. I’m scared I’ll get “kicked out” again because they might thing I’m alright now?

I promised myself to not jump into the next thing again (I barely had any time in between my previous relationships, you know how it goes lmao). And I’m great at keeping it like that at the moment! I’m actually feeling alright and that’s nice but I feel like if therapy goes “bad” now and I have a new boyfriend some day that it will just start all over again. Just because I currently fail to explain to her of what’s usually wrong.

Is there anything I can do without forcing myself into a bad situation?

I kind of need someone else’s view on this, it’s also a little bit of venting I think?"
"So overwhelmed by emotions and life today, don’t know how I’m still going.",2,mj4fjx,0,"Everything is happening all at once. College applications are due and I’m running late. I have isolated myself completely. My friends have all abandoned me. I’m disappointing everyone. I am spending too much money. I can’t stop crying and it feels like I’m falling into a joke that’s getting deeper and deeper..and I have to continue to work from that hole if I want life to get any better. I feel so hopeless, all my effort seems pointless like it will never get me anywhere anyway. I need help. I need someone to look at my life objectively from the outside and help me see some light."
"When the one person in the world that you wish understood you, doesn’t",3,mj47dc,4,"So tonight while I’m at work for whatever reason my husband decides to go through my room. I sleep alone and he sleeps on the couch. He tells me he found my pink bag. It’s the one with my gear in it. Instead of sitting down with me and telling me that he found my stuff, and show some concern or care.. he shakes his head and goes “you’re on drugs?” He towers over me with a DISGUSTED look on his face while I’m cooking. Looking down at me like I’m just a piece of shit that doesn’t deserve to live. So he puts me on the spot, attacks me, and causes me to become so uncomfortable in my own skin? I suddenly feel like sinking into the floor. I truly have been doing so good at keeping this a secret. We’ve been together for almost 9 years, married for 2. (We’ve always been on and off but things were actually going pretty well and so we decided to get married and finally get our shit together and focus on our little family. Once we got married things went downhill again). He had no clue about my addiction, though I only started using about 3 years ago. It never hurt anyone, I function fine. it was the one thing that I had to myself. It was my safe place, something only I knew about and I liked that. And he has to always TAKE everything from me. Well tonight he just took my soul away. Then you know what he says to me? “Who are you fucking for your drugs?” Like.. is that all that’s on your mind? Not fear that the woman you married, the mother of your children can OD at any moment? Not concern and worry that you may lose me? But your ego is more important.. okay. Way to make me feel like a worthless junkie that nobody really gives a fuck about. Just the way he looks at me just makes me want to die. He looks right through me like he’s lost all respect for me. I don’t know about you.. but if I just found out someone I really love and care about uses.. I’d give them a big fucking hug. I’d tell them that they don’t need to keep it a secret anymore. That I am here for them. I get how hard it is to just quit. Ask them what’s going on in their lives that is causing them to do this. Not fucking attack them! I can’t deal with this feeling eating at me from the inside. I feel so dirty. So worthless. He keeps cornering me to tell me who I’m getting my shit from, because I don’t he flushes everything I had down the toilet. Is he trying to fucking kill me????? Then he goes right back to playing his video games and ignores me the rest of the night. Like am I nothing? I feel like he did that just to make me feel like shit. I think he wants to see me suffer. There is so much I wish I could talk to him about. So much that I keep bottled up because it’s like talking to a wall with him. I could pour my heart out to him, bawl my eyes out and be on my knees begging for him to just listen to me and try to get me.. and he will not budge. I learned about love languages.. he definitely has more of the physical affection love language. He only is nice to me when he wants sex which we haven’t had in like a year. I just can’t have sex with him anymore. I feel like I’m just being used and I’d rather die than feel that feeling again plus my sex drive is dead now. I’m just not attracted to him anymore because all I see is a lazy fucking asshole. He doesn’t admit UNTIL THIS DAY that he used to hit me. He choked me out against the wall until I passed out with my oldest son in his arms when he was only about 2! When his family ganged up on me and his dad tried to hit me he actually grabbed ME and pulled ME back. I think that was the day I realized he doesn’t give two fucks about me. Back in 2013 my mom passed away. My ex showed up at her funeral and my husband (we weren’t married at the time) made me feel like complete shit with his passive aggressive bullshit and starts a fight with my ex in front of everyone. I’ll never forgive him for that. Actually finally writing all of this out loud makes me realize how much of a toxic, selfish fuck he is. He doesn’t take my BPD seriously, matter of fact he uses it against me. When I split and go ballistic he actually laughs at me or just leaves because he’s “tired of it”. Calls me names every day. Psycho bitch, stupid cunt.. tells me GET HELP. Not, “I’m here for you and I love you. I’m gonna help you through this and be there for you every step of the way.” He makes me literally terrified to seek help. Because of the way he mocks and ridicules me about the way I am, makes me feel like no one in the world will ever take me seriously. Like I’m actually a burden to even associate with. Like no therapist, no doctor can ever help me. He jokes that I need to be institutionalized and put down like a dog. He loves to always bring up my past, even though he knows it triggers my episodes. I just don’t understand how I ended up with someone with so little emotion and I have all the fucking emotions. I just need him to be THERE. How the fuck can someone treat me this way for years and I still keep him around?  Like seriously.. a person can only take so much. I’ve tried to make things work for the sake of our kids but I’m at my breaking point. The thing is.. I don’t ask for much. I’m falling apart more by the minute. To think all I needed was for him to be there for me.."
I HATE THIS,11,mj3w0a,1,"So basically my current FP told me he didnt wanted to hang out yesterday bc of a misunderstanding and I was ok with it THEN i went on to get slightly drunk (bpd + alcohol: hell) and LIKE THE STUPID BPD HEAD I AM I BLOCKED HIM EVERYWHERE AND DECIDED TO CUT ALL CONTACT just to regret it this morning when I woke up.. and NOOOOOOOW HE WONT TALK TO ME BC HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT I CAN BE A LITTLE bratty and unstable..

SO YEAH, HERE I GO AGAIN BEING THE COOL GIRL THAT SUDDENLY TURNED INTO THE UNSTABLE MONSTER.

well.. RIP us, I kinda saw a future BUT who would want a future with someone like this? I hate my life and my stupid radical brain."
FP just caught me stalking him online I wanna die,0,mj3r0y,0,why do I like him sm... we’ve been in each other’s lives for over 10 years. We’ve had a lot of drama and we started talking again and now idk I had successfully thought I moved one but I decided to give him a chance and now I feel like the same again. I love him sm. But I also hate him. I made a fake account on a dating app to stalk him and he viewed my stuff. I’m so fucking angry he was online at that time. Fucking asshole.... not when he’s getting my hopes up again and making me feel as if it could really happen. I even agreed to go see him again bc he wants sex and I’m so easy and I just want him to like me I want someone to like me I want him to love me. And idk why... bc this person... I should’ve be doing this. I would do anything for him. My heart hurts. He knows I have mental health issues and he keeps talking to me and ofc I love him he was the first person I loved when I was 14. He knows I have stalked behavior. I’m panicking bc I don’t want him to leave me. I couldn’t handle it again. Fuck I wanna die.
BPD and struggling with jobs.,8,mj3abm,5,"Recently I got a new job, which is great!   
I'm proud to have responsibilities and my own income, but with all my past jobs (including my current job) and bpd, I've noticed that I've always struggled with keeping a good image and doing the work I'm suppose to do.   
I keep trying to find ways how to lack at work and try to escape my responsibilities in a way no one could notice, but these actions can lead to getting fired or leaving a very bad impression of myself, if I get caught.  
I try to push myself to do these responsibilities, but if I'm ''not in the mood'' it's hard for me to push myself past this point.  
Am I the only one? Any recommendations on how to get better at jobs?"
I need to hear survival stories. I'm terrified my bpd wife will take off with my child never to be seen again.,5,mj30xt,8,"95% of the time she's the best wife anyone can ever have. Extremely loving, super understanding, same taste in everything, cooks the best healthiest food, including baking our own bread and pizza. She's very well read, incredible sex and lovebombing all day long, we agree on almost all topics etc. But 5% of the time when she'll have a meltdown over an argument, it only spirals into one thing. Every. Single. Time. No matter how big, small, trivial it is, the end result is the same: ""I don't want to be with you anymore"". Then she looks for plane tickets and starts packing her things. These meltdowns used to happen biweekly but I was able to learn how to avoid them, and now they happen every 4-6 weeks. Not bad at all. 

And it's not a bluff. She actually means it and I know she does. Then it takes a guantaran effort on my behalf to apologize for everything regardless of what I believe, and calm her down till she's back to loving me.

Here's the thing. It's a little difficult for her to leave these days for the following reasons:

1) We're in a foreign country, but we're moving to her country next month. I'll be the foreigner on a visa. 
2) She's unemployed, but might be in the future. That said, she has enough savings to last her a decade and can live at her vacant family home, while I poured all my savings into the marriage. 
3) We don't have children yet, and 99% of her time on Instagram is looking at babies and wanting to have one so badly. 

This might all change soon. We're moving to her country, she might get a job and she might get pregnant soon. I fear that when the next meltdown happens, it will be much  less complicated to just pack and leave. Only then, I won't see my child again, and will spend my time and money chasing custody. It's not how I want to spend the next decade. 

I need to hear success stories here. Did anyone have similar fears? Did they materialize?

Edit: BPD runs in her family, she has a divorced aunt who has it. She hasn't been formally diagnosed, and hasn't started DBT due to the pandemic etc. We're hoping when we move back to her country we can get that started."
Ghosted my therapist because I wasn't ready to face the music,0,mj2uqo,0,"So I ghosted my therapist at the start of March. Since the start of March, I've been on somewhat of a high. I've been going out with friends, I'm starting my new job soon, but I can feel myself descending into a depressive phase (Yes, I know it sounds like I might be bipolar but I got diagnosed with BPD like three different times). During my last session, my therapist and I made a breakthrough and I just couldn't deal with it. Because I was going into what I call a ""manic phase,"" I thought I was doing better and didn't need therapy anymore (LOL LIES). 

TL;DR Does anyone else feel incredibly comfortable in their emotional instability? There's something about it that makes me feel human and I almost don't want to lose it, but god damn it, it's exhausting."
I wish I had friends...,2,mj2p0k,1,"Friends who actually want to hang out/talk with me. Don’t get me wrong, I do have people that I consider friends who I chat with every once in a while through text. Sometimes over a phone call too but not often. I moved states a few years back and haven’t made too many new friends locally. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong as a friend but it’s just been so lonely the past year hardly seeing anyone."
my parents think my bpd stems from myself,16,mj2hu8,6,"TW: suicidal thoughts 

I’m literally at my last straw and I feel like I’m completely losing it. I recently opened up to my mom how I truly feel, I basically told her how I constantly think about killing myself and how I can no longer live like this and I really need help. She basically told me I brought this upon myself, and that no one can help me except myself. Except I don’t even know what’s going on with me, and I’m freaking out. I’m really at my last straw. She told me I’m selfish for unloading all of this on her because it makes her sad. I wish I had a mother who would just hug me and say it’s ok. 

The worst part is that she thinks that it’s me who gave myself this “illness” when in reality it was years of my mom and dad being both physically and mentally abusive towards me. I don’t know what to do. I really need help, but my parents don’t understand. I’m so sick of feeling this way. I just want to feel ok again, except I don’t know what ok feels like. Thanks for taking the time out of your day for reading this :)"
Did everything I was supposed to in order to move on but 2 years later I still can’t let go of my ex,7,mj2glf,9,"My ex and I broke up in March 2019 and I’ve been in a new relationship since May 2019. We haven’t spoken to each other once since the breakup (he broke up with me via email🤠)- he’s liked a few of my social media posts but I block him every time he shows up on my socials. I just can’t bear it. I miss him so much. And my new boyfriend is so much more stable, honest, and loving. But I just miss my ex so fucking much and two years later I still feel physically sick when I think about him being with anyone else. Maybe its because I didn’t realize the last time i saw him would be the last time. Maybe it’s because my new relationship doesn’t have that same undeniable passion that my ex and I had.  I just don’t know why it won’t stop hurting two years on... at this point I don’t think it’ll ever stop hurting. god I miss him so much.  it really makes me feel sick knowing that I still struggle so much without him whereas I imagine that he is completely fine without me ...  does anyone relate or have any advice? Just feeling so hopeless and like such a fraud in my current relationship. I do love my current bf but I also know if I ever ran into my ex or if he reached out to me I would take him back in an instant."
Never gonna get better,2,mj2gc7,0,Fuck it feels like no matter how much work I put in or try to be better I’ll still be in the same mf place and ugh I just wanna hurl myself all the face of the earth. Mood.

:/ i also just started anti psychotics so maybe that had something to do w it but ah! i want my feelings back because he is genuinely so good for me, he’s the first genuinely nice guy i’ve been into! the rest of my exes or love interests have all been manipulative and toxic.
i deserve this and i’m sick of my brain self sabotaging !!!!!!!"
How do you get validation/reassurance in a healthy way?,3,mj2601,1,"I feel like I'm starving for validation/reassurance all the time. I not only try to seek reassurance that my FPs don't hate me and aren't going to leave me, but I also seek validation/reassurance that I'm  attractive, that I'm capable, and that I'm a good person (morally speaking). It's like I don't exist apart from the mirror they hold up to me. 

If people aren't actively confirming these things about me all the time, I start to panic inside (I realize how irrational and unhealthy this is). I've noticed that I start to get angry at the people around me when they don't give me this reassurance, and then I will withdraw from them. As a side note, I'm curious whether this reflects NPD traits or whether this is just part of BPD. 

To affirm my attractiveness, I've tended to hook up with random people (pre-Covid) because I feel like I'm undesirable if I'm celibate. Since I attach to people too quickly, this has caused a huge amount of psychological pain for me and made me suicidal in the past because I felt disposable to the people I slept with (even though I  started sleeping with them primarily for validation rather than being in love with them). I want to stop this pattern because it's killing me. 

How do you get validation without using unhealthy behaviors or coming off as attention-seeking, manipulative, or desperate?"
Long rant. Overwhelmed.,4,mj1uv9,1,"I'm just so overwhelmed right now. I'm trying to get better for myself and not for other people but it's so hard. I don't want to be better for me if it means I can't have the person I'm in love with. I feel so angry about that. If getting better means I can have the person I love then it's just not fair. I'd rather throw myself under the bus for them to keep their love. Why can't getting better mean they'll love me more?

I'm watching my finances. I'm not drinking. I'm not doing drugs. I haven't self harmed. But I'm also isolating and refusing to accept certain things. I've done a few wreckless things here and there but nothing life threatening. But I'm struggling so hard to get better for me because that's what they want me to do. But it isn't fair. I'm doing it for them really and saying it's for me. I'm getting better against my own will because I want them to love me back like I love them but it isn't certain that will ever happen. And it isn't fair. It feels like I'm being forced to love myself and the crazy thing is I hate it. I don't want to love me for me if they won't love me back."
Fell in love with my bestfriend who's in love with another person and I don't know what to do,3,mj1kdm,2,"Help. I'm about to block everyone again and delete everything and isolate myself. I fell in love with my bestfriend and he's in love with another person. What should I do? 
I know I'm gonna be hurt after this. He might forget about me and realize that I'm not worth it. He promised that he won't leave. But I know that's stupid and I don't believe it. And even if it's the truth I know he'll get tired of me eventually (and I think it's gonna happen soon).
I just don't know what to do. 
Part of me thinks leaving everything behind right now would be best. To protect myself and retain that not yet damaged image he has of me. 
I'm becoming to hate myself more... each passing day. I can't take it. 
I want to be happy for him and support him but I just go up and down in these intense feelings of happiness when I'm with him and wanting to die when he's with her.
Lately the emptiness has becoming more constant and intense. Their relationship is progressing and I'm being left behind. 
What's the best way out of this? 
I don't want to hurt him. 
But I also can't take these feelings."
Is it normal with BPD to feel nothing for your partner at times?,18,mj1jyu,11,"This is something I've experienced in the past, but since this is my first long term relationship, it's becoming more of a problem. 

I love my girlfriend to the moon and back, but I go through periods of time where I feel little to no attraction or romantic feelings at all. 

Sometimes when we kiss it's like fireworks, but lots times it feels like nothing at all. There are so many times where I have cognitive knowledge that I am having an amazing romantic moment with someone who I love but my emotions just aren't there. 

The one thing that never really fades is the comfort I feel when I'm around her and how soothing it is to be in her arms. She's not my FP, so I know those feelings are genuinely about her and nothing else.

I always know that I love her and am attracted to her, but most of my feelings come and go so much that it sometimes makes it hard to feel happy in this otherwise loving and committed relationship.

 Is this a BPD thing? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just crazy or not really in love? What do I do? I feel so guilty for how I feel. :("
Help with coping after being abusive,2,mj1hpg,2,"Hi everyone,

New to the community. Recently referred by my doctor for therapy for BDP and am on a waiting list.

I am having a difficult time coping with the fact that I’ve been physically abusive to my husband in fits of rage. I get so angry that I almost black out and have no control. Unfortunately he has some scars now from where I once scratched him. I understand this isn’t an excuse and I don’t deserve forgiveness and shouldn’t expect it at this point. I know actions have consequences, but I feel god awful and cannot find a way to deal with this. We’ve been together since we were teenagers and are in our mid twenties now. I love this man so much but feel like I can’t help pushing him away and sabotaging our relationship. I have so much guilt and shame for my actions and feel like there is no recovering from this. He says he wants to be with me and I need to focus on myself and my mental health right now but I can’t find a way to do that when I look back at how toxic I’ve been."
i need help finding perspective.,2,mj1124,1,"CW: sh, suicidal thoughts, drug/alcohol mention. // vent

i can’t remember the last time i sh’d, it was 2018 or 19. i think i was drunk and ended up ruining the party.. it served as a wake up call and i stopped. i’m still struggling, but i’ve cone so far just on my own, learning to regulate and be mindful and differentiate between trauma triggers and present moment situations. my therapist is suggesting that since my symptoms are much quieter than they used to be, that my bpd might be cptsd. regardless, i’m symptomatic right now, and the last time i felt like this was when my supposed borderline was *really* bad. 

i’m not suicidal anymore, i mean, i know better. i tried that, it was horrible. i’ve grown a lot and i do love life, but right now i’m back in a house where a lot of my childhood/adolescent trauma took place. and it’s worse now. my mother is genuinely emotionally abusive (to my BABY siblings) and to me when i try and speak up. shes projecting onto me, giving me unfair ultimatums (if you don’t like the way i talk to the kids, you can find somewhere else to live), generally just being venomous (for a reason, but not one that has anything to do with me or my siblings). i get that shes in a toxic/emotionally abusive relationship, but shes not willing to do anything about it and shes taking it out on us. she’s admitted to it too, she knows. so much old shit that i didn’t even know had hurt me is resurfacing, i’m having nightmares about her and i feel tired constantly when i spend any amount of time around her. even when shes not yelling, i’m scared that she’ll start. 

anyway. it’s triggering. i’ve had fleeting thoughts about sh since being back but always worked through it, and tonight in the car i literally couldn’t stop thinking “i want to fucking die i want to hurt myself” and then crying and mentally apologizing to the universe because i had fully intended to hurt myself when i got home. 

my 10y/o brother had just told me today that he feels like he’s always angry or sad and never anything else, and after a long yelling match between my mom and the children, (i jumped a few times when my mom shouted, it’s fucking scary.) he said that he doesn’t think any of us love him. my mom told him that he was just being manipulative, and i don’t fuck with that. he’s a kid, and i literally had a narcissistic father. i know manipulative and that isn’t it. i said “mom, he’s overwhelmed and doesn’t know how to express what he’s feeling. he’s too young to be genuinely manipulative, he has empathy so it’s not a disorder. anything he’s doing is something he learned from all of us.” and she started yelling at me again. 

i’d interrupted her earlier because she was shouting in a nasty tone for a solid minute when i got the point, which was literally just “roll the window up.” she got pissed when i said “i get it, okay” very calmly, and i told her that i have boundaries, and one of them is that i don’t allow people to talk to me in an abusive way. i get the point, and don’t need to hear or engage any more. she got louder and interrupted me back, talking about “oh, you wanna talk boundaries? you constantly tell me how to treat/raise the kids. you don’t get to tell me how to act. THATS a boundary-“ and essentially just said i had no respect. she completely disregarded my boundary and put her own in place, didn’t even acknowledge what i was communicating. i shut up because it wasn’t worth it to explain how she was seeing what she wanted to see and still being rude and causing me fear, that the dialogue she just used was basically just a page out of the narcissists book. 

back to the car w my brother, she was yelling that i was crossing HER boundaries and just kept getting louder and not leaving any room for me to breathe or express anything. i told her that i don’t feel safe around her when she acts that way, and she said that i don’t take any responsibility for my sense of safety and put all of the blame on her. (she has no idea how much work i do on myself. how deeply i dive into my trauma responses and toxic traits every day, so that i can understand them better and work on healing.) she said that i need to just find another place to live because i can’t listen. thats when i turned away and thought that it would be easier if i just died, imagined and briefly considered jumping out of the moving car, thought that i wanted the release of sh, thought that the only reason (exaggeration due to emotional overwhelm, but the feeling was real) i couldn’t end my life is because i have so many siblings and beautiful friends who would be traumatized. i thought that i wouldn’t care how she felt if i did, but at the same i knew that that was me deflecting and trying to protect my ego, and i felt guilty for letting her hatred rub off on me. (still deflecting, sorry.) 

right now, i’m typing this instead of hurting myself. i’m trying to be mindful, but i feel like a crazy person. i need to know that i’m not wrong, that this is genuinely fucked and that i’m not being some manipulative holier than thou asshole. i need to know that this isn’t my fault. i’m recognizing symptoms of panic/shock in my body. my limbs feel numb and my jaw is clenched to the point of hurting, and i think i’m holding my breath. i can’t tell if i’m sweating because of this or because its too hot in the house.. my heart is racing even though i’m weirdly still and spaced out. i want to scream and punch the wall until i bleed, but i feel the numbness setting in. (i won’t do any of that, but i need to express the feeling before i shut it out completely.) 

does it.. does it make sense that i would be triggered to sh? i used to do it all the time at her house to cope w this stuff, and it was somewhat less frequent back then. am i being unfair by saying that i feel unsafe around her? nothing i try works and all that i can think of to do it turn the feeling back on myself. i’ve tried talking to her, letting her vent, saying that what she’s doing isn’t okay. i tried sending her a “signs of emotional abuse” article to help her see what she’s describing from her husband (and maybe get her to see what she’s doing) but as far as i know she hasn’t read it. nothing works, and even once i leave my siblings still have 14-8 years of this. that kills me."

Need help supporting GF with BPD Episodes,11,mj0i3k,15,"So my girlfriend has been having frequent episodes, every night or every other night. Now I totally realize that there isnt any ""solve-all"" answer for episodes, and at least from my position (not to mention long distance) the best I can do is offer advice and my love.

However, if theres absolutely ANY advice someone can offer in helping calm her down during episodes and keep her spirits lifted, from the perspective of someone else with BPD, i'd be happy to have it. Because whilst im not struggling at supporting her, the advice is still very useful to have.

She's the love of my life and I'm willing to do anything for her. Thank you for any support."
Does anyone else get random thoughts that you would be happy if the people you love died?,6,mj0gay,6,I get these reoccurring thoughts every so often it makes me feel so bad afterward and I feel like I’m a terrible person. Get I’ll get thoughts like “oh I’d be happy if my dog died. Or even my grandpa and even writing that makes me cry. I don’t know why I randomly get them but I feel so bad cus I love these people and animals so much. I don’t want these people to die I wouldn’t be happy I would be devastated.
Overwhelmed and want to cut everything off,9,mj0fjp,8,"I feel unwanted and like a burden to everyone I communicate to and feel like I could just cut everything off, set every account for deletion and break contact with everyone I possibly can right now.

I don't know what to do, I try to keep myself from rashly doing things to myself and to my ability to communicate with people but I am alone late at night and I have nothing to fall back on."
What are your biggest triggers?,6,mj0eyj,3,"I feel like I need to talk triggers with people who GET IT. I can’t help it when I flip out sometimes-trust me I do not want this. It’s embarrassing; I feel immature and toxic.

What are your biggest triggers? Do you have any particular coping mechanisms?

The first for me is feeling embarrassed/shamed in some kind of way when I have my guard down...for example in a rare instance that I feel happy and am not “watching” myself/my actions. 

Another is not feeling loved/wanted by my partner. Feeling rejected...which then leads me to project all my self loathing onto them. 

Both lead my down the BPD rabbit hole in a major way."
I feel so unloved and can’t convince myself otherwise,2,mj0c0k,1,"I have a hard time letting people in but when I do I love them HARD. Maybe go the point of suffocation and it’s really hard for me to to be so clingy. Every time they take time away from me I feel like they hate me and don’t wanna be around me. I feel so alone and it sends me into a depressive episode and I end up cutting people off for DAYS to WEEKS. In my head I tell my self, “okay stop. They still cars about you, they’re busy” “calm down” “you are loved” but it’s just impossible to believe. I want to be normal so badly. I hate being myself most days but especially right now. 
Sometimes I wish people I cared about were as clingy as me but I know what I feel isn’t right..."
"Hopefully this is ok to post about, but I'm a gay man in love with my straight best friend who is also my secret FP",6,mj00bu,5,"My best friend is awesome. Very smart, athletic, easy to talk to. People gravitate towards him. He's very much liked and he's attractive too so it isn't uncommon for people to be into him. 

I didn't have feelings towards him beyond acknowledging that he's attractive and a good friend about 2 years ago, but over the last couple years we have gotten very close and have spent everyday (close to) together. And I still am frequently frustrated that we aren't closer. 

I want him to enjoy my company so much. I want him to love me as much as I love him. And it's getting harder and harder to lie to myself about how much I am falling for him. 

He's also my roommate."
Who else gets seething jealousy when it comes to others?,10,mizv68,2,"I know jealous isn't exactly a BPD trait, but I feeling like having BPD makes jealousy a thousand times worse. I don't know how to be happy for others when something good happens to them. I just wish I was them and hate myself that I can't be like them. Watching my friend do her project for class and seeing everyone tell her how good it was, and rightfully so.  I couldn't help but fucking start hating my self right then and there because, fuck, why can't I be like that? Why can't I be that likable where the minute you walk into a room everyone just gets so fucking happy? When I walk into a room full of people I get nervous and occasionally lose control and lash out. I'm trying my hardest to be better, but who am I kidding? I  know my ""better"" still won't ever be decent. 

&#x200B;

She's been doing so well for herself lately, meanwhile I discovered who I really am which was an unstable, splitting asshole who can't go more than two days without having some emotional meltdown. I felt so horrible today that I had to call the suicide hotline and while talking I realized maybe my ""jealousy"" is really just my fear of her abandoning me for better people. I can't stand the fact that she might realize that I'm weighing her down and there's better people out there for her and she has no need for me. I can't blame her."
Idk,12,mizfjk,5,"I have nothing special to say so I’m not expecting any responses. The BPD is just running wild rn so time to vent

I feel like I don’t want to go to others and vent about my problems so to not be a pain to them but then I get to a point where I feel so shit that I don’t care any more I just want someone to help me so I try to manoeuvre the conversation to where they can ask me how I am but they never ask. Most of them at least. Some of them do sometimes

I’ve had too many friends block me lately and it always leads to me thinking that I’m just horrible to talk to or something. Idk how I am but it seems to be the logical conclusion to go to.

I had some proper social time for the first time in ages and I did the thing where I come out of my shell too much. I don’t want to consciously restrict how much I talk or what I do. I want to enjoy my time with people. But I don’t want to come across as weird or anything negative, which will likely happen when I come out of my shell too much. I also don’t want to stop myself too much and be too quiet either. It’s an awful dilemma 

I don’t expect any responses but they’re appreciated. I’m just feeling so bad over all of this stuff rn"
"Anyone disgusted by most people in this life, so only care to have 1 person in this life that truly matters to them?",22,mizct4,4,"Title, the above statement is based on my heightened but black and white unbelievably high moral standards i have for myself and others.

crush or not?,0,miz2a4,0,"so far, i’ve only ever been romantically interested in FPs.

I'm pretty sure I messed it up for good,3,miyzph,7,"My ex and I remained friends after dating for 2.5 years...We still hang out and talk, once in awhile hook up. We said we'd be up front if another person came into our lives. Well, he lied. I found out today he's been with someone else, then rejected me sexually which really fucking hurt. Part of me thought he would come back eventually, that 2020 was just a bad year and he would find his way back into my life romantically. I humiliated myself again and became overwhelmed with emotions. I cried, and begged him not to leave, came off desperate as hell. No wonder he doesn't want to be with me. He said he's not emotionally or mentally attracted to me. I poured myself into that relationship and it still wasn't good enough. I feel so unloved and unwanted.
He also said if a new woman came into his life, he would leave it up to her to see if he and I could be friends. I was devastated....considering when he was with me, he lied about another girl he'd dated prior but still talked to (which would have been fine if he didn't hide it), and I set boundaries about them talking. He refused to respect them and now he would do it to me. I currently am feeling lowest of the low."
How in the fuck do you control your emotions?,3,miytya,8,"Hey all. Soooooo, after a long while of not bothering with girls or feelings or relationships or anything, I've found myself unintentionally catching some feels :l

Now when I get a crush on someone, my brain just spirals out of control. The idealizations and fantasies I catch myself in the middle of (not the sexual kind to be clear), the deep need to be around this person, talking to them, getting to know them, spending time with them, anything. Its like my brain reserves a spot for something like this, and when the feelings are caught, thats all thatd occopied by this space and its alwayssss there.

Like fuck, I love liking someone, just seeing them makes my day, but my brain is such a little bitch it doesnt want to quit all the overdrive overthinking. Just a beehive of bullshit lol.

Now sure, regardless of how strongly I feel about people, you might be thinking ""just ask them out"". Now I would, BUT theres a bf/ex bf still around and idk what the whole situation is and Im not about to be that dickhead thats like ""dump this guy"", and its probably not a good idea anyways to suggest a relationship right after one has ended. Id love to get to know her more and we're gonna hangout as friends n shit and thats all I want/want myself to want right now. 

BUT

MY BRAIN IS GOING DOWN THIS RABBIT HOLE OF A SPIRAL AND IM WRESTLING IT EVERY SINGLE SECOND AS HARD AS I CAN WHILE FEELING EVERY LITTLE BIT OF IT WITH NO FILTER.

Like is this just what feelings are at this point when it comes to someone special in your life? How does anyone else manage it? Should I just avoid relationships my whole fucking life because my brain tears itself apart everytime I even have a smidge of feelings for someone? Should I say fuck it and just say I have feelings? Just..what should I do? Even just asking advice, I feel like Im cursing myself whenever I do and that the act of asking for it is what ruins me somehow.

Idk mannnn, shits fucky. Any responses at all are really appreciated, thanks all. Cheers"
I’m having a high suicide risk moment,4,miypu9,5,So I did this music video and it wasn’t very appropriate. Today my aunt doing it and posted it in the family group chat bashing me for it and now I just feel like shit I regretted the video as soon as I did it and asked to be taken out but I couldn’t now I don’t know what my parents will say I don’t want to know I’m just lost I don’t know if I should switch everything off or feel what’s about to come I don’t know if I wanna deal with it.
Recommendations on Self-Help Books.,6,miyoaq,0,"I have realised I have a fearful avoidant attachment style. I have always liked guys who are emotionally unavailable. The first 5 people I have liked were straight but I always looking for the signs that were low-key interested and I would get depressed whenever they wouldn't reciprocate. The next guy even explicitly said he wasn't interested and I still fancied him for a year 🤡. The last guy, whilst he was gay this time, didn't want anything yet all the signs he was giving me that he wasn't interested, I dismissed. In hopes that there was something more to it.

Like, I know when someone isn't interested in me but I completely dismissed it for him? 🤡

I don't have money for therapists and so far, the counselling offered to me hasn't been of great help and I am looking for some self-help books or advice on how to tackle my issues. I want to 'love' normally but its so difficult."
Struggling with first breakup since diagnosis.,5,miy2i9,6,"We were engaged. He cheated on me. Told me he blocked her and not to worry about her. This was like a month ago. 

I woke up today to being blocked and banned on everything. Using sleuth skills and alt accounts found out he’s openly dating her starting today and he changed all his main account pfps to happy pics of them together. 

Also we shared a friend group and they all went with him. 

No amount of therapy has prepared me for this. I read stuff about breakups but they don’t get how this reacts with my BPD. I really don’t know how to cope. How do you manage a breakup like this with BPD??"
"Just ordered Russel Meares' ""A dissociation model of borderline personality disorder"". Excited!",6,mixsfl,0,"I'm not familiar with his work and I've been through DBT many times for 2,5 years in total. I feel like I'm ready to go into the origins and hopefully find healing with working with Meares' method. I've also heard great things about the Kernberg model of transference work in therapy (which is more brutal for the patient and the therapist), but I feel I want to first read about this more compassionate model. 


Also, as I've been in therapy for many years I found it vital to have DBT as the grounding technique and method. But I feel it doesn't go deep into the root causes and I felt still incomplete and lacking of an identity, so to work on these second/third step methods, stability is a very good thing going forward. If anybody is interested I could do a review of the book here after reading it. Cheers to everybody on their journey :)"
does anyone with “quiet BPD” ever wish they were more explosive?,24,mixldx,9,"please note: first i want to acknowledge that having more implusive and explosive BPD is very difficult and i want to make sure you know i’m not trying to fantasise it on purpose. 

i tend to act in and just withdraw myself. i’ll write paragraphs in notes and never send them. or ill rant to myself about them. cry and generally feel like shit. but sometimes i wish i had the guts to lash out. 

it’s usually my first impulse but i fight it off and just stay isolated and depressed. 

this only vanishes when i’m with my family though — it’s mostly built up from the trauma they’ve caused me. but with my friends i rarely rarely ever go “crazy” and cut someone off. I think i’ve only done it 3 times but it was necessary. and if i do i still feel a bit guilty.

also i used to be an alcoholic but managed to cut wayyy down. and now only drink and parties and very rarely. but i sometimes wish i was back where i was a few years ago and i was messy. 

i mean i’m basically addicted to weed now and do get upset without it but can force myself about a week sober before i crack. 

i think it’s mostly cause i want people to take me more seriously about my illness. specifically my family cause then maybe they’d take me seriously. and sort of as a cry for help. 

i’m very great full i’ve come a long way with healing but there’s that part of me that doesn’t want to get better and it sucks cause i deserve to be and i know that. but fuck the split thinking is stressful as hell."
I wish it would all go away,6,mix4p5,2,"I'm so tired of this. I was doing good and then everything goes bad again. I feel so sad. An unbearable sadness that just won't go away. I keep dissociating. I'm irritable and paranoid. I feel like I can't trust anyone. I want to cut everyone off but I only have two people left.
I'm so angry that nothing I do can make this better. Therapy I think will only help me handle my emotions. This will help me keep healthy relationships because I'll learn to not react negatively I guess. But what about me? When can I stop feeling these negative emotions. Its too much. I feel like everything about getting better with bpd is for the people around us and not actually to help the person with bpd.

I'm not diagnosed... I'm sorry. I'm very sure I have it. I'm just having a hard time getting myself help."
Everybody tells me I’ve lost weight😕,1,mix006,2,Now that they’ve told me I looked at myself in the mirror and saw myself differently I look skinny and frail I was 150lbs and now I’m 138.4lbs I wanted to lose weight again to be 130lbs like I was when I was cheerleading but in that time I was working out not starving myself I don’t even do that on purpose I just forget to eat like my mind doesn’t find it important I don’t know what’s going on maybe it’s because I’m going through so much stress in my life right now either way I’ll try to arrange a new diet.
I'm so tired of this,1,miwtdg,0,"I live in poland. I've been all my 23-year-old life and I'm just tired of it. So much is happening right now. We have a really terrible government. Most of the people here are racists, homophobes and pseudo-Catholics. It's like having Trump and his followers around for as long as I can remember. The ruling party cares about no one but itself.

They spend our money on pro-life banners that are everywhere! AT EVERY F\*CKING BUS STOP! They say LGBT + people are just an ideology. Our own president said so. They're trying to impose Catholicism on us, and I'm sick of it. I am so tired of this hypocrisy. I just want this to end.

Having BPD doesn't help with that either. My depressive episodes got worse. I feel empty and numb. How to cope with that?"

i feel like im stuck in a cycle of self hatred and anger,2,miwj51,3,"it starts like this:

i hate myself so much i refuse to take my meds so that i can purposefully make myself feel worse as a punishment

i end up feeling so bad without my meds that i get angry at myself for punishing myself

this anger makes me hate myself even more so i punish myself even more by refusing to take my meds to maximize the misery i think i deserve

this only fuels the anger so on and so forth

and because this is all self caused i refuse to reach out to anyone cause i did this to myself 

i dont know what to do,,, i dont feel like i deserve anything , my self hatred is so strong and intense partly due to my lack of meds .... feeling so horrible about life"
"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just the replacement of one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""",810,miwc67,51,"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

I know the stigma attached to Borderlines in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. And it's the BPD lot who need it the most.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.


*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**"
Just diagnosed with BPD + fp hurt me,3,miwb20,3,"So, I still can't accept this. If I ever had kids, (which idk if it's wise to bring new life to this shit planet) they could inherit this on them as well, meaning my future life is already affected and it hasn't even started yet.
Also, I think that after this, all I'm going to do is push people away. They keep hurting me, and eventually I'll hurt them and I'll hurt myself. 
I was with this guy I'm seeing now and we went into an argument and he harshly responded to me ""that's just fucking stupid, what you're saying"", over and over. It broke me. Everything was going well until that reaction. After that I entered in panic and all i could think was my ex saying those same things to me. I felt stupid, i felt like I'm worthless.
What now?

"My BPD Dad Tried to Groom My Daughter to Hate Me! Anyone else dealing with this, too?",1,miw8u1,16,"I have a 6 year old daughter with a speech delay, so only recently has she begun telling me things that my dad has said to her.

I know people will ask why I ever let my kids be around him, but he has always seemed to be nicer, gentler towards my kids than to anyone else.

(I have been in denial about him ""changing"". I have fallen for every single apology from him for 39 years. My mother also always begs me to forgive him and give him another chance.)

In the last year, he has pushed me to the point of No Contact, but it only lasted for a few months before he showed up at my door.

I need help,1,miw8rq,2,"Hello guys!
Im really trying to figure out whats happening to me.
I don't know if this is the right place to write this or does it have something with bpd, im sorry if not.
So lately i have been feeling really confused for my pratner and my friends.Its lke im faking that im happy to see them and stuff and i have been really confused about my feelings for my partner which really scares me because i really do love them and i want to be in this relationship but sometimes i feel like i have another person in me who just says that i dont love them anymore and it affected me a lot.Maybe its because i convinced myself so much that they dont want me that i pushed myself away from them but i dont know.Im diagnosed with depression so maybe its from that but i really dont know.I need help because i dont want to lose this person or think about my friends in this way.Pls, any kind of help is welcome.!!"
is it bad that i’m best friends with someone’s fp?,9,miulqb,6,"i don’t know if this is the right subreddit / way to ask this but i’m still learning and need advice, since i myself don’t have bpd but want to be more accepting to my friend who does. (i’m also not too good with social cues as i’m autistic)

hi so my friend (we’ll call them A) has bpd, and i know that their fp is another one of my friends (who we’ll call B). A and B have always been super close, but lately they’ve stopped being as close bc B and i are becoming better friends. 

since B and i have gotten closer ive had this intense vibe that A hates me (even tho we used to be best friends), and they’ve also been making kinda passive aggressive anon posts (things like they’ll tweet “im angry that you exist” but not say who it’s about)

should i back off? i’d never want to hurt A or make them hate me, they’re very important to me, but so is B, who has been there for me when no one else was. i cant control what A or B think of me but i know i can control how i handle the situation on my own. what should i do? /gen"
how self aware are you,3,miuezk,6,"i’m confused about this aspect of the disorder. my psychologist says i have traits of bpd and the main reason she doesn’t want to diagnose me with it completely is because i’m quite self aware.
i feel like i can notice it when i experience symptoms like splitting. emotions are odd for me because i can only recognise them when they are  extreme enough. 
a lot of these things i couldn’t notice before until i found out i might have bpd and i read more about it. i can relate a lot to quiet bpd more than anything esp because i tend to hurt myself instead of other people when i’m angry or i deny i’m angry at all.
anyway, how does self awareness work with the disorder for you? sorry if this is all stupid it’s3 am"
Why keep going?,6,miudaj,1,"Nothing matters to me more than dying. Im just waiting for an accident so that I can avoid being blamed for my passing. There is no point of living with this curse. Literally no point. No amount of therapy, hospitals, drugs, friends, or whatever else can change this. Ive been dreaming of the day i die for over 12 years. I just need a way that looks like an accident. Or for my therapist to finally sign the papers for assisted suicide, if its even legal for me. I beg her constantly but she wont do it."
Relationships are too much work :(,2,miub5a,1,"Started my first relationship in 4 years but it's been so rocky from the start because of my BPD. I made sure he was aware and he's very caring but I'm so hard on him. He gets jealous of his ex so I mentally tap out, I'm there for him sexually but he's busy whenever I need a little help and it flies over his head when I explicitly tell him I'm kinda suffering over something, just switching the conversation. My FP gets it (she doesn't have BPD) and I love her to death but man, I'm so disappointed in myself for this. I don't know how to nicely let him go, he's incredibly nice and sweet but I don't want him to feel like he's walking on eggshells because every little thing ticks me off."
Catching feelings after two weeks...,8,mitvke,2,"(19f) So I met this guy two weeks ago and before meeting yesterday we had Netflix partied together and talked over discord. I was really nervous about him coming over but everything went great. 

I told myself from the very beginning that I did not want to date this guy at all, period. I was not interested. We sat on my bed together watching a movie and we were comfortable with each other. I was kinda sitting on my side and he was positioned behind me to where my butt was touching his lower thigh but we weren’t cuddling, hard to explain. He eventually moved his leg to where it was bent and resting partially on top of my thigh. 

Mentally I could not handle this because of me loving physical touch. He could have easily moved back. I mentioned that my cheeks were soft and without asking he touched one side (I had no problem with it). 

He also had his arms wrapped around the sloth stuffed animal that my ex and I had an inside joke and love for. I don’t know how it made me feel. 

So presently I’m obsessing over this all."
Almost everyone that has ever meant something in my life is gone and I don’t know who I am,1,mittas,1,"I lost my childhood best friend and I left replaying why it was my fault and the shit I did to get to this place and even if I am growing to be a better person it was at the risk of losing her
I think of it every day it doesn’t get easier with time because time keeps passing

I have a weird relationship I ended and I feel sad bc he is rlly attached so am I but the last day we saw each other is when he apologized for something real fucked and then left to work and been gone for 2 months and we are going to hang soon next month but fuck it felt :| since and I do forgive him my feelings just fluctuate but I still want him ): and it’s weird
Like I see attraction in others and I felt bad for it and I realized to feel like my sense of self is to create a new one and stay the fuck away from relationships bc the idea of loving someone is something I always craved in life and I only experienced shit but I let the idea of loving someone become a big part of myself and my life that I never been into anything else but wanting love
And this boyfriend I left although not together long taught me what genuine care is and I know he means it when he says he wants to marry me 
And I miss my friends I feel too disconnected from my family to talk to them

I can’t talk to a therapist and let them on because I am enlisting in the military and wanna be a therapist later in life and feel like the truth will fuck me over with being mentally unfit 

I haven’t self harmed in a while but I have rage and the depression is so real and I been fighting it al my life but the rock bottoms never get easier you just manage and fuck I crave help and change"
DAE Have extremely low self esteem?,2,mitna2,0,Like my self esteem is so low that if I do badly in a video game I play I start to self harm and question why I’m even her and put myself down in so many ways and start to think that I’m a failure at life and will never amount to anything. Is this normal for someone with bpd?
How does it feel to have BPD and NPD,0,mitb4a,1,"So I definitely have BPD but not diagnosed, but got the obvious symptoms like extreme fear of abandonment, frequent mood shifts, keep changing the person I am, suicidal thoughts when I feel like I’m getting abandoned or lonely, feels like I’m not one person but like two people. So I’m not asking if I am a borderline because I myself know I’m obviously am one. The only thing that doesn’t fit to me is blaming myself, I don’t blame myself for anything and think it’s pathetic if I did. However, having BPD does feel like hell sometimes and I hate it, I will be talking to my therapist soon about it to get better. 

I sometimes felt like I have NPD as well , maybe because my dad is an obvious narcissist and a close friend of mine is  as well. They talk about themselves all the time, everything they have is the best, they’re the best, engage in risky behaviour and so on. I remember my dad and mom used to fight a lot when I was a kid and my dad left us when I was 10 so maybe that’s where I got BPD from. They both would get really angry, shout and throw things and I remember back then I took it really bad. I still recall the feeling of this intense fear of not knowing if they’ll end up killing each other or something like that. Obviously now that I’m an adult I’d just break the fight up but back then I was just powerless and scared. 

Now I’m not exactly like that, especially when in a low mood I wouldn’t say I’m narcissistic then. I’m usually not hostile to people, and can act humble sometimes. However, when I’m in a happy mood I’m such a different person that even feels like a narcissist. I feel like I can do anything, I’m loud, love compliments, even a bit of a bully, grandiose fantasies, wishing bad on others which makes me feel better, love attention  and love to show off how fearless I am. I honestly wish I was like that all the time. I have been called narcissistic by family members before, for being selfish and not really giving back, but I know I’m not even close to those toxic narcissists that are literally horrible to everyone. I know some people would feel offended being called narcissistic, but I take it as a compliment, I’d much rather be NPD than BPD. I hate having these strong emotions and wish I was a sociopath or something so that I wouldn’t feel this fear of abandonment this bad.

So my question is how do people feel like having both BPD and NPD? Both conditions are in the cluster B but they do also differ a lot so just what to know how the combination feels like."
Recently got into graduate school and don't know what to do about therapy,2,misz01,5,"I recently got into a fairly exclusive graduate program in my field (sorry to brag) but unfortunately it is located in a different state. This would mean I would have to stop seeing my therapist. I also got into a good but less exciting graduate program (sorry to brag) in my current city, where I could continue seeing my therapist.

I'm really at a loss here, I don't know what to do. I'm not trying to be dramatic or anything, but I really find every part of my life that's not therapy pretty unbearably bad. The idea of losing the one part of my life that is soothing and nice is very distressing. At the same time, a radical change (like a big move) *could* result in my life feeling better, and ultimately I would like for there to be some reason to not kill myself besides ""my therapist would be upset"". On the other hand, it also could result in more spiraling down, this time without the support of someone who I know and trust.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is there any way to choose between feeling held and flourishing? Thanks for any insight."
My therapist will abandon me,6,misxby,3,And I cant handle it. Im 28 and for the first time in my life thought i had a therapist who would last. Ive been with her 2 years. Now she says im not progressing fast enough and maybe she isnt the right fit. She also told me my suicidal thoughts are likely never going to go away. I feel defeated. Defeated and empty and utterly alone. I want to kill myself so damn badly.... If only I was allowed to... My friends would never forgive me... I keep hoping there will be an accident or ill get cancer or something. But nothing happens. I hate existing.
I finally want to get help in being diagnosed,3,mismj9,2,"I have had terrible mental health since i was about 10 years old, i’ve always known there’s something wrong with me. the more i look into it the more i match the diagnostic criteria for bpd (quiet, in specific) 
Does anybody have any advice on how to get support / diagnosis stories?"
DAE struggle with people treating you like nothing more than an illness?,4,misc47,2,"i have this friend who i have been very close to for a few years. our relationship went from two genuinely good and close friends who talk frequently and enjoy eachother's company, to not talking at all unless they're checking up on me (to ask me ONLY about my mental health) or i reach out to them first (which i have stopped doing because they were incredibly patrionizing). 

this shift in how they treat me started earlier this year with some small instances and odd comments made here and there, but since they just recently started a new relationship it's gotten so much worse. i never expected this from them because they are also mentally ill, and the subject of mental illness is something that has always been so casual and openly talked about among us and our other friends. i've been keeping my distance from them, but it can be hard sometimes because of our mutual friends and group texts that we share. i also just miss being able to talk to my friend and being treated like an actual human being, not someone's problem, obligation, or just an illness. 

this shit is already isolating enough, covid is isolating enough, i can't take people i've put so much of my trust into icing me out too. i've made a few attempts to try to bring our conversations back to how they were, and earlier today i expressed how i've felt after a certai insensitive comment was made (not about me, but another person with bpd) and was straight up ignored. i think what hurts the most though is that they know i struggle A LOT with abandonment issues, and we have bonded over our anxieties about it  in the past, yet they're still treating me like this. 

i guess this is just more than a rant than anything else, but has anyone else experienced this? how did you deal with it? did you confront them? did you leave them?"
dude.. BPD is no joke,83,mirqvu,13,"in the matter of seconds/minutes i can ruin everything and not feel any negative feelings for those two seconds. but after the matter of me destroying my relationship singlehandedly in under a minute, i feel complete and utter guilt for even existing.

Is this normal?,5,miqnen,6,"For the past week I've been listening to an audiobook that was set in my FP's hometown. This part made me really happy and I felt the happiest I have in ages listening to it. Then it got to a part where the main character moves away to a different town. This has made me feel awful and I don't feel like listening to it anymore, it almost feels like I'm grieving. I don't know if this is normal and I don't know what I should do."
"I'm tempted to tell work I have covid so I won't have to go for a couple weeks, then lie about health stuff and quit. I only started a few days ago.",2,miqmxg,6,"I left a part time job about a week ago after being offered employment full time at a new store. 

At my old job I knew pretty much everything, some regulars recognized me, I got along great with my coworkers. The only issue was I was only being worked about 10 hours a week because of how little hours there were to go around, and the only benefit was an employee discount ( which wasn't even much of a discount when customers could get a coupon for the same amount ).

Then this new job called me and basically hired me on the spot at the interview. I worked a couple days before I started having panic attacks at the thought of even going back. I had a panic attack at work. The people are nice, but the customers there are a whole new breed of asshole and I'm still barely grasping the work after being there almost a week. I hate it and I feel like my mental health took a VERY steep and sudden nose dive. My boyfriend even noticed it.

They're very understaffed right now but they have a few more new people coming in this week but I can't stand the thought of going back. 

This morning I felt SEVERELY nauseous and called out because I was 100% sure i would be throwing up, especially if I went. I had a FULL ON breakdown over decided if I should call out or not and freaked bf out. 

I told my boss I had a fever and was vomiting, he just asked if if been in contact with anyone with covid ( no ) and said to call him if my fever persists. 

Now I'm tempted to call him and say that I was in contact with someone who had it, just so I don't have to work for a week and a half, and then quit in a few days when I'm off the schedule. 

I don't have any belongings there to go back for so I wouldn't need to face anyone.

But i also feel like complete shit. They're nice and understaffed, and it's not their fault I have issues. But this was also my first "" adult "" job with full time and benefits. I don't NEED the benefits right now because I can still be on my parents insurance, but the extra money was nice. 

But I don't think I can mentally handle this without it ending with me harming myself. I don't want to let people down when I'm trying my best to be an adult. It sucks

What do I do ?"
DAE have physical symptoms from neglect of personal care?,11,miq3vl,6,Example I was too depressed to get out of bed for long periods of time even to take care of myself and say brush my teeth and got minor periodontitis (I’m 22 about to be 23 thought only old people get this shit).  Also it’s advanced form of gingivitis from lack of care cause I would brush my teeth too hard because I’m always dissociated it’s not noticeable for anyone to see and my gums are healthy and teeth white and clean and you cant see anything wrong with my smile it’s just fucking making me think I’m ugly af now and that was one thing I kinda was proud of (which is vain af I know) sorry
Suggestions for how to cope with suicidal thoughts?,7,mipyhw,14,"Multiple times a day, sometimes almost constantly when I'm upset, I think about ending it all. I see a bridge, and need to mentally convince myself not to jump, or I see a knife, and have to convince myself not to hurt myself, not even a bit... Sometimes its almost constant. And when it's a good day, the thoughts are still there... Just pushed to the back of my mind. I do whatever I can to distract myself from them. But on Tuesday my hopes were sort of shattered... My therapist said these thoughts will never go away, and she can't make them go away. She said all I can do is learn to live with them, and push them away. But its so tiring... So incredibly tiring.... Does anyone know of any tricks to make the thoughts actually go away, or not come? Pushing them away just isn't enough...

 For context, I'm 28 now, diagnosed since 18, in bpd treatment therapy for 2 years now. On Cymbalta, zyprexa, and truxal. 

Thank you!

DAE only feel comfortable and real with one person on this planet?,12,mippb2,2,"i understand what FP means so no need to explain that. 


22f here. so, there is only one person on this planet i ever miss. right when i met him it was different from ANYONE i have ever met. i immediately felt safe and comfortable. with everyone else in my life, friends, parents, family, girlfriends & boyfriends, whenever someone touches me i immediately stiffen up, feel anxious, and get extremely uncomfortable. but not with him, i met him and right away wanted to hold hands, i was mesmerized by his hug. i didnt even feel a little nervous. 



i didnt have any feelings for him initially but then a mutual friend of ours told me that this guy really liked me. so i started to crush on him, and we got together. we broke up exactly one year ago, things have been getting a lot closer again since january. i have always loved this guy. we split because he felt like he needed to focus on himself and think about our relationship more. but now we are back to being lovey dovey and i think we are gonna date again soon. 



we met 5 years ago and i still haven't encountered anyone i even feel remotely similar to. i dont miss anyone else, i dont want to spend time with anyone else, being around other people is tiring. i genuinely dont need friends or family to be satisfied. just whatever he does naturally is perfect for me. 



im not demanding with him or obsessive or needing constant attention. i love how things are and i am so thankful for him. our relationship makes me grow, makes me feel more considerate. makes me feel like i am not crazy and i can get better, i can control my emotions. the thought of having a stable & healthy relationship makes me take a deep breath and discuss solutions. i have grown so much because of our relationship. 


i feel like a complete alien to everyone around me. people just do not understand a word i say. but things with him are just right. i have not ever met anyone else i feel drawn to like him. i am happy with that but im wondering if anyone else thinks is this way? or am i crazy 🥲"
Horrible dreams every night,2,miplf1,2,"I have dreams every night basically that my boyfriend will cheat on me and then I find the girl and I'll beat her up. I don't think I would do this in real life ever because I know it's not the girl's fault. But anyway, I just want to stop waking up anxious. Does anyone have anything that stops bad dreams? Like any coping skills or tricks? It would be much appreciated. Thank you."
I am absolutely LIVID with my brother,2,mipjx2,1,"I've been job searching for TWO years and because I don't know anyone in this fucking town I've been rejected for over 50 places. How the fuck am I suppose to get experience if no one hires me?? My brother who has more connections said he would help me however he could. I didn't have much hope until the pandemic hit and he said they NEEDED more coworkers. Even though they didn't have a job application online, who does that?? He promised he would talk to the manager and get back to me as she has an irregular schedule and I couldn't just waltz in to find her. He even gave me hope about getting the job because no one wanted to work there.

Several fucking months later and no answer from him.... we go in to bring him cupcakes for his birthday and who do I see??? HIS GIRLFRIEND IS WORKING THERE NOW. She was only RECENTLY unemployed and unlike me she's not spending pennies at the grocery store. She got a freaking starbucks every day when she wasn't working and she lives with her mother rent free. HE WENT AND GOT HIS BITCH GIRLFRIEND A JOB AND BROKE HIS PROMISE TO ME. I just know her greasy ass threw a tantrum until he helped her out, that's how she gets everything she wants.

I might end up walking the two miles home because my family is stuck in the store oogling over everything. I wish I could slap them but I just stormed out instead. My whole family fucking hates me.

Edit: yay now my nose is bleeding from the stress"
I intensely hate myself.,3,mipbir,15,"I really just think I am the worst person. I have 0 self worth. I do reckless shit to feel better or hoping I just die but somehow I always wake up at home.

Idk how to feel better. I feel so stuck, I feel like idk where I am or who I am. I hate the person in the mirror. I hate how I just feel worse and worse everyday."
They/them?,5,mip8dq,4,"Lately I’ve been feeling very disconnected from myself. I’m not sure if it’s the BPD or what, but I feel very....umeshy (no it’s not a word but it feels right) about myself. I’ve been doing some reflecting and I’ve started feeling like I would be more comfortable being referred to as they/them rather than she/her. But I can’t really explain why, which makes me feel like a poser? It just feels much more comfy. Idk. Am I allowed to change my pronouns and even though I’m not totally sure why it feels right? I’m going to sit with it a little bit longer before making any declarations or anything. I’ve talked with my wife about it and she was very supportive."
Is this some form of splitting? PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS,1,miot7x,8,"TLDR at the bottom. Sorry for the long post. 

&#x200B;

I had to move back to my home town after university ended and thus lost all my university friends. They were amazing people and we still talk about once a week and I absolutely adore them. They always pushed me to be better and they were the reason I lost 50 pounds and got into shape, I got over my social anxiety, and I graduated at the top of my class.

&#x200B;

My high school life on the other hand was miserable and I hated every single second of it. There was too much drama, I was bullied and called names for being the fattest kid in school every single day, and I just had all these people who lied to each other and fought with each other and then became bffs all in the span of one day. I assumed that was just drama that happens in every high school and just brushed it off. 

&#x200B;

The day I graduated high school I sweared that I would never speak to any single person from here ever again. But due to my hometown being small I kept running into them whenever I was visiting my family. Some of these people acted like they changed after school and I gave them the benefit of doubt and became friends with them. We hung out for like a day every year and texted sometimes. Everything seemed good. 

&#x200B;

But after I moved back home the frequency of our contact became more and more and I realised they are still trapped in that high school drama and their entire life still revolves around high school. They act like best friends but EVERY single one of them bitches or gossips about the other behind their backs. They force me to drink whenever we hang out and threaten to never invite me again if I don't drink with them. They ignore my messages for days on end and only call me or message me when they need a favour or want to use me as their emotional punching bag.

&#x200B;

I am tired of this and I just wanna stop talking to them. Not saying they are bad people, but they are definitely bad for me. A part of me tells me I am just splitting on them and thats why I am seeing them as all bad. I have given it over a year but things seem to get worse. I am afraid that I will have no friends left if I leave them and thats what makes me stay in this toxic and suffocating friendship. Any perspective or advice on what I should do would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Don't have any friends who live close by other than people from high school. They make me feel worthless and I give into all their demands because I am scared to be abandoned. Am I just splitting on them even though for the last one year I have felt they constantly make my life and mental health worse?"
What is your reaction to someone being upset while you’re in a confrontation with them?,2,mioasy,5,"
I’m wondering what feelings and thoughts you have in this situation and what your outward response/reaction is. Please be honest in answering even if your reaction is along the lines of wanting to hurt or provoke them or blaming them for their feelings. 

Do you consciously notice someone upset in the moment? Does it take being informed afterwards to notice or being away from the heat of the moment? 
Do you consciously think about whether it is “rational” for them to be upset? 
Does it differ whether they are upset in more of a hurt and sad way versus more of an angry/defensive way? 

Does it differ if the confrontation is online/over text, without any way to see their facial expressions or tone of voice? 

For context and reason I’m asking, I am diagnosed BPD and was considering how I personally react in this situation - which is not something I’m necessarily proud of and really  want to work on. I was also thinking about what I see of other people in my life and how they react in this situation, so I’m curious to hear about people’s experiences.

If you’re interested in my personal experience: I usually am aware of the other person being upset when I see it. I don’t tend to predict upset reactions from what I’m saying or doing so I don’t consciously think of intentionally wanting to upset them. If I see that the person is directly upset by something I’ve done, my reaction tends to be very defensive, or if it’s over something self-destructive that I am doing it tends to make me feel a bit detached/dissociate and continue the destructive thing impulsively. If they indicate that they’re upset by something else I tend to focus on that and can sometimes even switch out of being angry and confrontational to being supportive, and usually I also start to feel guilt for harassing them while they are upset by something else. I don’t often find myself in situations where people are upset in a hurt/sad way from something I’ve said or done to upset them but when that does happen I usually initially feel sort of justified in proving them wrong. I find if it’s online/texting I tend to think they are not any more angry or upset than I am so I can be justified in expressing myself in this way to them; unless they explicitly say that I crossed a line, then I’d usually apologise or maybe back off while still a bit defensive. I think for me the defensiveness is what I struggle to let go of, even though I can (usually, except where I think they’re just outright factually incorrect) completely appreciate their viewpoint and apologise after getting past any intense emotions."
There's so much I wish I had done differently,1,mio8n6,1,"I know borderline makes things feel so much more intense but this love isn't from that. This is real love and I don't have it close to me anymore.

I'm not saying I wish I would have changed myself completely for him. I just wish I would have given more than I took. I wish I would have been more willing to see things from his point of view. I wish  would have loved him the way I was supposed to and not been so caught up in myself. Right now I think I'd given literally anything to have him back. I don't care if it's tomorrow or if it's years from now. I just want him back in my arms. I'm trying so hard to get better for me, but at least a tiny piece of me wants to come out better so I can have him back. I am starting to be happy for me but I miss so much about being with him. I wish I had told him all the things I love about him before I left. All the things I still love about him. I'd follow him to the ends of the earth. I still love him so much. I want it all back. Even the rough days. I want it all back."
"Birth control, rage and Abilify",2,mio4r4,4,"For the women on here, what has your experience been like with BPD and hormonal birth control? And for those who have had children, what was pregnancy like?

After spending a significant amount of time on and off of multiple hormonal contraceptives (a game I like to refer to as musical birth control), I’ve realized that hormones just fuck with me. There’s a significant amount of evidence that some even directly compete with medications like lamictal (the mood stabilizer I’ve been on for 5+ years now).

I went from being stable for the past 6 months to unstable and experiencing symptoms again after starting the nuvaring a couple of months ago. I felt a little off kilter but noticed something was really off when I felt enraged for 5 hours last weekend. The episodes have been popping up more and more lately so yesterday I asked my psychiatrist for help.

They prescribed me an as needed dose of Abilify, which I’m optimist about. The rage episodes have only happened a couple of times and I just keep to myself when I’m ramping up and use my DBT skills to try to come back down. They don’t help as much as I’d need them to which is what prompted me to ask for a different solution.

Is pregnancy going to drive me off the deep end? I’m planning on trying to conceive in the next couple of years and am admittedly a bit worried."
Anyone talk out loud to themselves everyday?,157,mio2o9,35,"I just want to know if anyone else here talks to themselves. Out loud like someone else is in the room. Have conversations and talk about what's on TV and whats going on with yourself. 
 

I know it seems weird lol but I just want to know



Wow Thank you I didn't expect alot of people to upvote this. I just talk out loud and say my thoughts. Sometimes I'll pause the TV just to think out loud. It's like I'm my own friend. I just didn't expect alot of people to do the same thing. Idk if it's normal or not lol. Some people think it's crazy lol"
Partner's new job giving me a hard time; Advice needed,2,mio1sg,0,"Hi, this is my first time posting here, because I could use some my advice, since my therapist isn't available right now.

So, as the title says, my partner has recently started working at a new full time job. Before, xey used to work part time, which, even if it did sometimes interfere, gave us enough time to talk.
(For context, it's a long distance relationship.)

Now, as you can imagine, she is my FP, meaning I'm extremely emotionally codependent on xem. I was used to talking to xem pretty much all day; He always did a great job of making me know I'm loved and I could tell xey actually enjoy talking to me.
We used to call as much as possible, sleep on call, etc. etc.

Before she started her new job, we did briefly talk about what it'll mean for our relationship; Xey let me know we won't have many chances to talk while xey're at work, and that I should maybe try talking to other people during that time. (Which did trigger a meltdown & a mild split, but I'm more of a quiet Borderliner, so he never really found out; but it was rough)

Now, with her working all day & being too tired to really talk when xey get home, my fear of abandonment has been going absolutely crazy. We keep changing or dropping plans, I don't get as much validation as I would usually need to know xey won't leave me and my meltdowns & relapses have been getting more frequent again, with no one around to really support me.

Thing is, I'm scared of bringing it up, since he clearly is enjoying his new job, and I really don't want to make xem feel bad about it. I'm glad she found such a good job.
I don't want my stupid overthinking brain to ruin it for xem, but it's been slowly killing me and I don't really know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, I hope some of you have advice."
BPD & Holidays,22,minp1n,7,"Does anyone else absolutely hate holidays and would so much rather skip over the day completely? They’re a big rage trigger for me. I think it goes back to being a small child and hating that my family pretended to be normal on holidays. Even as a kid, I could see right through the bullshit. I hated that I had a glimpse of what normal could be but that it would never actually be a reality. And I couldn’t enjoy it because I knew it was inauthentic. So now as a 27 year old, I have the same hatred toward holidays. I am just a completely unpleasant person to be around on them. Not that I’m a peach other days, but holidays like Easter drive me up a wall."
No personality post breakup with fp,14,minhbd,1,"So my fp and I broke up in November and since then I feel like I don’t have a personality anymore. We were together for four and a half years and I spent most of that time becoming what she wanted and needed. Now that it’s gone, I don’t have anyone to “become” anymore I guess. Does anyone understand this? Or why it happens? 

I want to become my own person but I feel like I don’t have the ability to do that. I’ve only been diagnosed recently and I don’t know a lot about BPD to begin with so anything is helpful!"
I can’t feel remorse.,19,min48e,10,"
It doesn’t matter how I treat other people, even close ones. I don’t feel guilt. Also it’s not like I go out of way my way to mistreat other people. For instance I didn’t cry or even feel sad when my maternal grandparents died recently, and I was pretty close to them. I even felt annoyed and irritated upon witnessing my mom wail when she received news of her mother’s death over the phone.

I never regret losing friends. I could be your friend for several years and the day we have a fallout you’re simply out of my mind.

Also, I don’t feel remorse even when I rationally know I have misbehaved in a particular situation. If I feel like it and am in the mood, I can reach out to you and try to mend things. But never in my reaching out will I be motivated by guilt, it’s more of a need for things to be convenient again.

Anyone else?"
i just got diagnosed,4,mimzm4,2,I got diagnosed two days ago and it hurts so fucking bad i knew i always experienced having an “FP” but never expressed it because i didn’t know i had bpd. he left two weeks ago it hurts so fucking bad. i feel like i can’t relate to anyone and my friends have all left me even though i hang out with my friends a lot i feel like they don’t care about me and the loneliness is so fucking painful. all i want is for him to come back and i just keep thinking about all the shit i wanna do to cope with it that’s self destructive. i just feel so fucking alone and i’m worried i’m never gonna be in a good relationship. i turned 18 two months ago and i’m relieved to know what the fuck is wrong with me because it wasn’t something that could just be explained with anxiety and depression but once the initial relief wore off all i feel now is so much fucking shame i’m thinking of all the toxic things i’ve done but i can’t tell if i’m just overexhaggeraring it in my head or if i’m actually a difficult person to be around
Toxic relationship,3,mimbzk,4,Anyone else in a super toxic relationship? I go back and forth with how much I hate him and then how much I love him. We’ve broken up and gotten back together like 3 times this  month and it’s just non stop control and jealousy and anger on both ends. I’ve never been this low mentally but I don’t want to leave.
How to manage jealousy?,0,mim7s2,1,"So one of my FP, I suppose I have multiple. He is now seeing a girl/dating? and it’s made me verrry jealous, and irrationally especially since he was an ex and I have a SO as well. I’m mostly upset cause if feels like alll his attention is gonna go to her, he invites her over to his place every other day and I know it’s irrational. 

He’s even said that if he wanted me for him to break up with her to keep me in his life he basically confirmed he would. I don’t want to do that though, cause I realize that is not healthy to ask and would be so out of line. I just don’t know how to get over this. Every time he mentions he’s busy when I call him at night after work I know it’s because she’s over and they’re up to who knows what, I can’t just hold my anger. I’m not interested in him at all I just am upset about feeling like I’m competing for attention?"
I only exist if I talked to someone,60,mim58e,16,Does anyone need to talk to someone 24/7?  I feel like I stop existing once I stop talking. it's a huge burden to that other person bcs they have their own life & things to do. I feel lost when I'm alone for even one minute. I feel like I don't exist.
I'm not sure if this is dissociation,9,milx4c,10,"For the longest time I classified this as a ""normal"" panic attack: when I feel overwhelmed, I don't really notice symptoms ike a rapid heart beat, sweating or shortness of breath. What I'm experiencing is somehow very hard to describe for me, it feels more like my whole body and brain is ""shutting down""? When this happens during a conversation, I become almost completely inresponsive, my vision is blurry, I can't control my facial expressions and I barely move, everything slows down. The worst thing about it is that ""tingly"" or ""vibrating"" sensation all over my body, especially in the back of my head. I've tried to describe that horrific feeling to friends of mine who regularly suffer from panic attacks but nobody seemed to get that part. In general, they describe it as feeling of intense fear or as if they're about to die, while I would say I'm losing touch with reality/shutting down. It often happens when I'm getting critisized or when someone, usually an authority, expresses discontent with my accomplishments. 

When I was looking up dissociation, it was described as ""zoning out"", which I can relate to a lot. The thing that confuses me is that so many people experience that for a couple hours, so I was wondering wheter this could also be labelled as dissociation if it only lasts for about 10 minutes? I'm still numb for hours afterwards, but the physical sensations disappear rather quickly.

DAE know that uncomfortable ""tingly"" physical sensation? Can dissociation feel like that?"
The little promises that make me feel bad.,8,milewp,3,"I hate how the tiniest thing makes me feel bad. My roommate was leaving for work and made a comment about telling me something later. I said they could tell me the story after work and they said ""that sounds good."" 

I waited up for them to get off work and have just been sitting in the living room waiting for them. Well turns out they went over to a friend's house after work and aren't coming home tonight. I know it's not a big deal and they didn't think anything of it, but even just a little thing like that makes me feel abandoned.

Even just the slightest promise and possiblity that someone might want to spend time with me makes me feel so good. Even worse is my brain kept telling me that they didn't actually want to spend any time with me and with them not coming home it makes me feel like my brain was right. I know I shouldn't think this way but I still feel sad.

It's not even just my roommate, my sister has also made plans for lunch the other day but then forgot. We rescheduled for another day and they forgot about it again. It's hard for me to convince myself that people actually want me around when it seems like they always forget about me."
What would be the best way to break up with someone who has BPD?,6,milbi2,10,"My girlfriend has very severe BPD, along with a long list of other mental conditions such as Autism, Anger Issues, etc. For reasons I won't be going into I really just need to end the relationship at this point but I'm very scared to. She's made it very clear several time that I'm her ""Favorite Person"" which I know is a very specific role someone plays to a person with BPD.

She lives in a very bad place and doesn't really have anyone else to support her, which makes all this a lot more difficult.

She has suicidal tendencies and could break down from very small things, additionally she has made it pretty clear that she might very well kill herself if I'm not there.

Now, none of these things are the reason I want to end it, I knew most of it going in and patience for these things isn't an issue for me. I just REALLY need help to properly do this so she'll be alright."
I keep oversharing :(,382,mikria,50,"I keep oversharing things way too fast.  
Talking about things that I don't want to talk about.  
It just happens.  
And when I meet someone I fully engage into the conversation with things that are a little sensitive. Like Trauma or whatever. I want to keep it to myself but it's like a thing that keeps on happening and I hate it. How the hell do I stop? :("
Numb and disconnected,7,mikfow,1,"Had some big overwhelming emotions the other day. My husband he didn't want to talk about it. Essentially shutting me down. It has to do with our daughter and I know he just wants to not talk about it because it makes him very mad, sad, and frustrated and he wants to ""let it go""  but I need to process it too and I do that by talking through my feelings and perspectives surrounding the issue. Anyway, just left feeling like there's just no room or space for me to have my feelings about it. I hold space for everyone around me to have their emotions but no one seems to have space for me. Now I feel so numb and disconnected. I dobt know why I'm posting this. Thanks for reading. Therapy on Monday. Feel like Ive unplugged from the matrix."
BPD and insomnia?,4,mijwwe,4,"Hi all, I’m wondering how many people here also have insomnia? I’ve been reading a lot about how sleep deprivation can lead to psychosis and kind of feel like that’s what is causing my BPD flair up....... lmk what you think"
Family Vacations,1,mijtkd,0,"I don’t think no one wants to enjoy the holidays as much as I do, I deeply have the feeling of hope that I will finally get my dose of catching sunsets and calmness. However, often the opposite happens, specially when I’m around my family so I feel like a fool every single time because the expected feeling is never met. 

I just really really struggle with setting expectations, I set them as low as I can tho, because I know that at some point family drama is going to emerge. I really wonder if I’ll ever be able to spend a normal time with them. The extended family of my mother has a very particular way of triggering all that is wrong inside of everyone. Seriously, how can anyoneeee at all enjoy their time when they can’t stop fighting and at the same time not communicating with each other. It’s not BPD anymore, I realized it’s just not possible for anyone to stay sane at all. (Which by the way, lead to a pretty bad episode, it’s been a while since I didn’t have an emotional crisis of that level) 

So, from now on, I’m keeping myself as far away as I can from them. Isolation time all the way baby."
I had 4 friends block me this past month. I'm having a massive panic attack this morning and I don't know what to do. I need a break from work and life,21,mijj8j,27,"I had 4 friends block me all for different and separate reasons. 

1 of them was random but I hadn't spoken to them in years, but the blocked me after I readded them

2 person block me over politics on Facebook 

3 person was a crush I had at work who accused me of telling people about his secret onlyfans, which wasn't true. 

And 4 which hurts the most was an old friend I had on Facebook who sexted me for a month after his breakup, only to block me yestersay out of nowhere and tell our other friends that I am a narssistic brat. I tried to ask him what I did wrong, but he refuses to speak to me. Our shared friend circle doesnt think I did anything wrong, but feel that our friendship is over due to his own personal issues. 

I find all of this very hurtful still as I am trying to see what I did wrong, but I seriously cannot see what I have done wrong. I have tried to communicate myself to these people but got misunderstood.

I feel like I made out to be this monster. I cannot sleep and I've lost my appetite and I just feel like everyone hates me. I feel so manic this past month too binging and having sex recklessly.

Why do people hate me for existing 

Should I go to the ER idk what to do"
Horrific episode last night,1,mijctb,0,"One of worst suicidal episodes in a while. Despite years of this, I still don't understand how I can go from having a positive evening to within 10 minutes I'm completely out of control. I don't know what to do anymore. My therapist hasn't texted back, and will probably recommend to check myself in to the hospital. Reached out to new therapist just now but dreading the usual line of questioning followed by recommendation to check myself in to the hospital.

I don't understand what I want from them anyways. I get upset when they take me seriously and want to check me in, I get upset when they don't take me seriously and downplay the situation. Is it too much to take me seriously but not immediately transfer me away?

I'm exhausted from no sleep, scared, ashamed, and really really wishing I had a support circle to help me during these times. I wish I had someone I could trust and feel safe with who understands."
I hope my dad dies soon,8,mij8or,15,Hes gave me this curse of a mental illness and he refuses to acknowledge he did it. He continues hurting me and i just dont understand anything . Why would he ever do something like this to me?? To his only daughter?? I hate him i hate him i hate him and oh my god. I really do hate him. Hes narcissistic as hell . Hes the devil. He literally ruined my life ! He projects all his pain and issues onto other people and lacks something as simple as self awareness. I know hes sick too but he doesnt have to project it onto me. Im done. I cant love him.
It feels impossible to get diagnosed,8,mij3bu,6,"It’s been around 5 years of my mental health slowly declining. I was diagnosed with anxiety but I just know it’s more than that, it almost feels like they diagnosed me with that because it’s easy and they can just give me drugs and move me along. But I know that it is a wrong diagnosis. My partner was the one who first brought up the idea that maybe it was BPD, we first considered ADHD and as time has gone on and my mental health has changed and declined we decided BPD seemed to fit (this was also after much research across the time period of around 6 months and them watching me change over the last 4 years). I want to go to the doctors but I know I can’t handle the passive aggressive dismissal they always do when I try to talk about it! I’m just mad and want to know how to help myself because if I don’t soon the worst might happen"
BPD: a never ending rollercoaster,4,miiwy5,1,"TW/NSFW: self-harm, suicide and abuse.


i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder since the summer of 2020, right after me and my then girlfriend broke up. 

i was devastated when i heard the news, because i never realized why i was hurting my favorite person in the world. at times i would literally idolize her: i'd write her books with how much i loved her, buy her all the things she loved without her wanting it at times and giving her an overload of love. 

but then the splitting would kick in and i'd become the worst person ever to her. i would be so mad and devasted when she would go out with her friends, even though i suggested she should have gone out a little more. she would be so confused as to why i was acting the way i did. even i, back then before knowing anything about BPD, would be so confused. it was like i was trapped in my head where i was looking at someone else hurting her. i would even tell her (when the fighting etcetera was over) that it wasn't ""me"" who was telling her those things.

eventually, at the end of it all she marked me as a manipulator and i was so confused because i didn't get why'd she call me that, when truthfully i never hurt her because i wanted to do so. it was so confusing and it left me even more devastated when it ended. i lost about 10kg in less than two months, because my body refused to take any food. ironically, because when was still in a relationship with her i would constantly eat until i couldn't walk anymore (also a lil good BPD trait: risky behavior). i would tell her i felt suicidal every time and i even tried to end it multiple times. 

everything was always so overwhelming because i felt the emotions at least 10x more than the ""normal"" person would. i would tell the psychologist this behavior followed me since every relationship (both platonic and romantic). i would never be stable with someone without it actually hurting me and the other person. 

BPD is the worst thing ever. sometimes it's impossible to deal with all the things coming with it: drinking alcohol until i'm numb, smoking packs of cigs to feel something, self-harming until i can't feel and so forth. and just when you think it will stop, it won't and everything hits you as hard as the last episode. 

i don't know if i have to thank my mother for this (also diagnosed with BPD and schizophrenia, currently am not living with her) or my father who abandoned me at a young age (fear of abandonment starts kicking in). maybe it was the trauma giving by my caregivers: the hitting, the screaming, wanting me to be perfect at all costs. 

what i do know is that i am an actual survivor and i'm doing the best i can every day. and to all my fellow BPD survivors, if you read this entire thing, thank you. you're so strong too. i love all of you, we can do this <3."
I forgot to take my meds and now I'm feeling impulsive and depressed,2,miiw8i,1,"Apparently I needed my meds more than I thought. Because I accidentally missed them today and realized way too late. 

And now I'm feeling impulsive and wanting to dye my hair but I'm indecisive on what to do with it. So I'm trying really hard not to do anything to it. (Except I did a strand test already) 

But the more I try not to do anything to my hair, the closer I feel to fricking crying or wanting to SH. 

what can I do to distract from the impulsive feelings?"
i am So faking it,13,mii00c,3,"God, i don't know why but right now i feel like i faked everything, every memory of feeling bad and all the horrible things I feel seems fake to me. Am I just normal and imagine all of this to make myself special or different? Fuck I'm SO scared that maybe I am faking it, all of it. I don't know what to do, I almost want to hurt myself or do anything just to feel horrible to know I'm not a fraud. this feels so awful, i hate myself"
Paranoia?,1,mihnvy,1,How many of y’all have rlly bad paranoia? Like yu think somebody’s only wit yu to gain sum from it or to hurt yu. And always thinking that somebody’s gon leave and/or ghost yu. Or am I jus unstable.
I have no reason to keep going,2,mihn81,0,"I’ve been going through a really rough time lately and recently did a two week partial hospital program. During this program my outpatient “broke up” with me out of the blue leaving me high and dry. 
Now I’m at a dead end job making shit money and my partner doesn’t understand. I’ve struggled with money because my family has always lived paycheck to paycheck and now that I’m an adult I can’t find a well paying job that I qualify for that doesn’t make me want to die. So now I’m broke, miserable, and feel like my partner doesn’t love me anymore. I don’t see any possible way to make things better as I’ve tried many different jobs over the years and always end in the same conclusion. Things never get any better for any substantial period of time so what’s the fucking point. I just want to be able to live like a normal fucking adult and I can’t even do that."
I can’t take it anymore,10,migjqs,7,"I am a (F21) and this is my first time on Reddit, I’m crying hysterically so please bare with me and my typing. I hate my condition. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it so bad, my boyfriend left to go get space after a big fight and I’m not sure if he’s coming back, he said he isn’t breaking up with me but I don’t believe him. I’ve changed him as a person, I hate myself. I hate this mental illness, I feel terrible and like a monster. I’m having a huge melt down I feel like I can’t go on anymore, my head won’t stop with questions, reassurance and altogether my moods. I am in therapy, on meds and have a job. I’m so depressed I want to write goodbye notes, I just want to die I feel like I have no one in my life I feel like a terrible person. I my anxiety is so bad I feel like I can’t function, I HATE being borderline. I have it so bad I’m so impulsive, I want to change and I will but I’m so done with everything. I can’t take it Reddit, I need support or something I don’t know anymore. I’m so worthless I can’t even breath, I feel like I’m making no sense and no one understands me. I don’t want to be here anymore, I’m so sick of it. I really need to talk to someone, I can’t. I just want to run away and never come back, I’m so done. This is really me venting but my melt down is so bad I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR I can’t take it anymore, HUGE meltdown while typing this probably ruined relationship for good this time. I want to die, I can’t take it. I hate being borderline."
Anyone else feel like after you attempted once... It made it easier to try again?,3,migiul,2,"Before my first attempt, it never crossed my mind to actually go through with it.

I don't know if the trauma did something to me, but I've attempted twice since(extremely unsuccessfully). It took a lot for me to do it the first time, the second and third were over such silly problems... I can't even remember what the reasons were.

Idk. I feel like once you try once, it's takes a lot less to make you try again. Maybe I just accepted that it's something I'd be able to go through with."
Not everyone is gonna get you,12,mig0ts,3,"I think this is so important to remember, honestly more of a note to myself than to others. Living in a cliquey freshman dorm at a work hard party harder college is super overwhelming for me. I recently got in really good shape and am now very good looking, but I am very much not a frat bro kinda guy. I’ve recently started getting a lot of attention because of my looks, but I’m often sensitive and anxious which makes people confused. And also my bpd self simultaneously loves being admired as attractive and also am terrified that people will be disappointed once they get to know me. I can’t really disappear anymore like when I was fatter and unattractive. I’m a topic of conversation whether I want to be or not. Girls are interested and confused by me and guys are competitive with me. Like they don’t understand why I’d be depressed. Like it doesn’t compute with people that I have mental health issues. It’s simultaneously flattering and annoying af. Anyway a lot of people seem confused that I’m not super confident. And I also feel a lot of pressure to hookup with hot girls, like if I don’t get with someone who’s considered equally attractive it means I’m being lazy. Also people found out I cried over my fp and I got shit for that."
I hate it.,14,miflw5,8,I honestly don’t know why I’m writing this post. I just need to express myself to someone who might understand. I feel everything at once and nothing at all at the same time. Right now I’m feeling every emotion possible but I’m also numb. Please tell me I’m not alone. I just am done. I’m so tired! I’m so tired! Please just anyone let me know I’m not alone.
Long phases of completely desocializing,8,mienzr,5,"I have not replied to some of my friends since the start of the year. With others, it’s been a week or two, will probably spiral into months... I’m actually getting lonely, but I feel like everyone who I’ve not replied to for weeks/months probably doesn’t even think of me as their friend anymore. (I always reply when there’s a sense of urgency though, like if something happened. Haven’t had that in a long time though.) So I can motivate myself to finally reply even less...

Can anyone else just not find the energy and motivation to talk to people? I’m kind of in a slump and even when I try to write answers, I can’t think of anything. Nothing makes sense. Not even what to answer to ‘how are you?’."
dealing with grief? random vent.,2,miekdq,3,"i just have a question. at the end of august 2020 i went through a very traumatic experience that i never processed, and then i lost one of my best friends about a week later (he was in an accident), and then a bunch of fucked up shit happened to me again right after that again and i never felt like i completely grieved or felt his death or any of the other fucked up shit that happened.
-
background: i had a very messed up childhood. i mean messed up to the point where the only way i can remember it is by looking at court documents and pictures and watching videos. sometimes i get random moments where i smell or see something that brings a memory back to me. i can remember certain things but not just the simple day to day life. like i have no idea what i was doing as a kid. i was always just messed up at home and then at school i was quiet and ‘brighter’ than some of the other students. school came easy to me growing up, i do remember that. but i’m almost done with my junior year of highschool now and i started doing really bad my sophomore year. now i’m basically failing because i lack all motivation to do anything. i simply see no point. i know that i am young, but ive always been seeing a therapist or a counselor or talking to CPS and social workers blah blah blah. me and my brothers all have. my mom and my dad are welllllllll something. my youngest brother (let’s call him Jim) got diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD at the age of 5, he is now 13. and my older brother Orion got diagnosed with bipolar and ADD at the age of 7, he is now 23. i am 17 and i haven’t been diagnosed with anything because my mom only cares to worry about my brothers, she sees herself in me and the life she couldn’t have and i often catch her jealous. i love my mom, and it kills me because i constantly try to talk to her and get through to her. i always write stuff and plan to talk to her about how i feel because she ‘feels left out’ but then she forgets. or she forgets about me self harming, or me needing help. yeah. and god. my dad? he was my best friend when i was little and we did everything together. i was always closer to him than i was with my mom, but my brothers were closer to my mom. i always backed him up and defended him because i thought my mom was trying to keep us away but i don’t know what to think anymore. there have been situations that have proven to me that they both lie, but they both tell the truth sometimes. i find myself constantly questioning them and because i question then i question myself and everyone in my life. they taught me to question why and what reason when talking to people, if you understand i’m sorry. it’s frustrating always trying to put people in a box or a file i don’t even know who my dad is anymore though. he’s changed a lot since covid started. everyone has. my parents were both drug users in high school that “fell in love” and became teen parents at the age of 17 with my older brother, never got married.  our situation with my dad was very on and off and confusing. he ditched us the day my mom got home with my little brother from the hospital like are you kidding me? both of my parents are definitely narcissists or borderline or something. they constantly have episodes and i notice it. i thought everything growing up and the way things would happen was normal and the way me and my siblings feel was normal but it isn’t. my siblings and i portray a lot of their qualities and it scares me, same with my moms mom. i love my grandma but boy is she bonkers. after my dad left our lives moved around a lot always living with different people growing up, mostly our grandparents. when we would stay with our mom on the weekends or during the days she had this abusive ass boyfriend i still vividly remember. i still remember his face and i can’t remember a lot of faces. same with his voice. i know none of this really matters but i’m not diagnosed. and there’s a lot more i could say to explain why i believe it’s borderline but ive done my research on many mental illnesses growing up because i realized something was off. i’ve taken a few psychology classes here and there and nothing really seemed right to me. i’m currently in a nursing program as well, because i strongly believe psychology is a field of department i do good with. nothing seemed right until i started to read threads on this sub about a year ago when the lockdown first began. i was feeling really trapped because i was in a relationship with someone that was really confusing and my friends told me he was mentally abusive and manipulative but i never figured out if it was me who was sabotaging the situation because i was afraid or if it was him who really was just mean. i always think back to us having good times though. i began to read about the symptoms that people had to have to be ‘diagnosed’ and i literally started shaking. these symptoms were the same exact things that i had been repeating to all of my therapists, my mom, my dad, my counselors, my friends, my teachers, like fuck anybody. i just needed someone to tell me that what i was experiencing wasn’t normal and that i needed help. i also kept scaring myself because i would see things like oh mentally ill people won’t know if they are mentally ill or will self diagnose themselves, but what if i know i have a problem ? what if i’ve always known something was off? it’s this numbness and empty pit but wide burst of emotions. but if anything happens that even slightly affects me happens, i just shut down now. not physically shut down just mentally. i don’t feel things anymore and it’s scary. i have no idea who i am, and everything just resorts back to me killing myself. it’s like, nothing have a universal solution to appease everything so why not just leave. because i mean, we are here for such a short period of time compared to everything else that will ever exist. but no, unless i am dying i need actual help. my therapist is an idiot who is predictable, makes jokes about my dead friend, and just tells me to believe in god, and no offense i have nothing against any religion but i have respectfully told her that i am not a Christian. this ties in because i don’t think i’ve every truly grieved for my friend. i know i lost him and i know he’s gone but sometimes i still just expect him to like text me or tell me he’s coming up to the summer to visit or pull up with my friends to go to the harbor or something stupid. sometimes i’ll catch myself just feeling his presence and getting overwhelmed and upset. then i’ll just move on from that feeling and be numb. about a week before he passed i was r*ped. he was apart of our friend group and it happened after a party, he was supposed to take me home but instead he took me to his house and took advantage of me. i never knew really what all had happened because i was actually black out drunk. like the entire hour car ride to his house i was in and out asking where he was going and i couldn’t walk, i couldn’t see. we were being stupid smoking and drinking as much as we could, i mean last party of the summer we brought 99 proof bottles and hard liquor. but this guy didn’t have much to drink, he just had his usual few blunts. he was virtually sober compared to me. and to any asshole out there reading this, i said no and i wasn’t wearing a sluttly outfit. so yeah that happened, my friend passed, then some shit happened where my older brother almost died a few times off of a drug overdose, and then he blew up his car a month later. he’s okay now he’s just i don’t know anymore. i see my dad in him, very impulsive and angry. but i could say the same for all of us. i’m sorry for babbling. i don’t know if any of this made sense or if anyone is even gonna read this i just am struggling and i need some kind words and i just needed to get all of this out there somewhere and it feels good. also, feelings are really hard and i haven’t liked anyone since my last relationship, the one that was either ‘abusive’ or self sabotage. i do this thing in relationships where i’m sure most people here can relate, i just ruin them and i push them away. i get mad over the tiniest things that they do and i need like any drop of validation i can get from my SO or even just my friends. i constantly feel annoying or sometimes mean and i always overthink everything i say or do. but i also always question everything everyone else does or says. like why or what can they get out of it. it’s really hard sometimes. it’s like everything in my life is a puzzle. but there’s this guy that i think i might like but hes kind of the same person as me. we are like the same but opposite, his mom isn’t in his life and my dad isn’t in mine. he’s trouble, and im trouble. we are hard on each other but i know we appreciate each other. he makes life a lot easier but he doesn’t really know it. i just don’t want him to become my next FP because i haven’t been like revolving my life around anyone for a long time, not even myself i’ve just been in a sort of numb mode of hibernation since everything happened. i’ve just been living life. i know that once he really gets to know me he won’t like me for who i am, or maybe i won’t like him for who he is and that scares me too. it’s like everything that could happen i think of and i have to process what would be the outcome of it all if that makes sense. i’m just constantly thinking. i’m sorry. goodnight."
Seeing people diagnose each other online pisses me off,91,mieje3,65,"Not just with bpd but for example bipolar and npd also, they’re thrown around like it’s nothing. Especially npd 🤣 nowadays every other person is a narcissist

I just think it’s harmful as they can spread misinformation, just because someone has a certain trait or has done a certain thing doesn’t mean they have a disorder, are you a doctor or why do you think you’re qualified to diagnose someone based on a simple post? 🧐"
I CANT STOP OVERREACTING,2,miejam,1,why do I expect to be showered in love all the time? All my bf told me for my birthday was “Happy birthday” no I love you or anything. To most people it wouldn’t matter but it hurts me so much WHY WHY DO I DESTROY EVERYTHING I LOVE
Are you dramatic and twist stories just so your moods and behaviour seem acceptable to society? Fuck.,3,mie199,3,"I've always been super dramatic. Every little thing affects my day. The thing is, when something seems like a ""big deal"" to me, others will almost instantly react with ""so, that's not a big deal"" and downplay my feelings which in turn makes me feel invalidated. I start adding things to the real story so it lives up to my dramatic moods, so I don't look like im overreacting. Let me give an example. Lets say I spilled my coffee on the table and it was almost empty. I will say, my coffee was half full, hot and got everywhere. Stupid shit like that. I can't stop myself. Its so stupid and compulsive. Lets now give a real life example. My buddy lost 10,000$ in investments overnight. I told my boyfriend about it, but I said he lost 100,000$. I don't know why, it just came out pf my mouth like that. And now im sticking to it. Then I start believing my own lies and its just a fucking mess. I can honestly not even tell apart which trauma of my past is real and made up anymore."
Weird symptom.,3,midy9z,4,"Hi guys, long time lurker first time poster. 
I’m a 30 y.o male and I was diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago. 
I’ve had this really weird feeling for as long as I remember, it comes and goes and it’s hard to explain but I’ll try my best. 
Not sure if it’s a BPD thing or something else. 

Anyways. I’ll be lying in bed with my eyes closed and sometimes it will feel like the world is contracting and expanding, everything feels smaller somehow, then it will feel massive. It will last for around 10 minutes and then stop, it also sometimes happens when my eyes are open. 
Apologies if this makes no sense, I’ll talk to my doctor about it when I see her next but that’s not for a while, just wondered if anyone else had this feeling or is it just me?"
Every little thing feels like the end of the world,6,mids5v,1,"I'm so exhausted of my heart breaking, my entire world crashing down, and wanting to kill myself over every single small fucking thing that goes wrong in my life.

I just want regular emotions and a regular brain and to not die inside, for months, every time something bad happens to me. 

The idea of a whole lifetime of this shit makes me want to scream."
Why do my friends / FPs keep pretending to enjoy me...? Please stop.,5,midnz2,0,"I know a lot of us have these intrusive, even delusional thoughts that we are secretly hated by all of our friends and even strangers. At least I know I struggle with this.

Well, I’m able to tone it down to constant doubt and uncertainty on whether my friends enjoy my presence. I need a lot of reassurance and enthusiasm from the other person or orherwise a lot of doubt and fear starts to settle in. Vague responses and distance are my biggest enemies.

Has anyone else however had a streak of FPs / close friends that have actually PRETENDED to enjoy you? Ergo, your “delusions” and worries of abandonment were actually completely right?

Now that all of my past relationships were this way, my fears seem reasonable and correct. People love to pretend to care about me then slowly sizzle away, still pretending “to spare my feelings” while I go mad from trying to understand what is going on amidst my cognitive distortions and BPD thinking. I end up absolutely devastated once I realize the months I wasted pouring effort and time on someone who was actively trying to distance themselves. 

Wondering if this is something that has happened to you! Why do I keep meeting these type of dishonest people...? I understand trying to spare my feelings, but this hurts me incredibly much more. I start to doubt every single relationship and my own reality, my sense of judgement. This is why I end up ghosting."
No one ever goes the extra mile for me,20,mid7ob,2,"It feels like I'm constantly putting in 100% to relationships, platonic of otherwise, and people just don't care! I feel like if I only relinquished info about myself when prompted people would just know nothing about me. I feel like I'm constantly bending over backwards for people and they just don't care. I know this is probably just because of my bpd and my tendency to get super passionate and eager in relationships but that doesn't it doesn't hurt. I feel like no one has or ever will love me like I love them"
Bad hair impulsive,1,mid76w,1,I was impulse and in my feels and craving change again especially recently and knowing we r still in this pandmeic a 1yr plus later . Sigh it looks so bad and I hope my friend can fix it today and my mom is gonna be mad idk why she get mad about MyOWN hair . The fact I was wearing blue eyeshadow yesterday and she freaked . I also do not feel comfortable going to a hair dresser .
Rough Day,1,mid0o3,1,"Hello fellow humans,

Today, I ended a one month relationship. I cried/sobbed uncontrollably for about 4 hours today. Not pretty crying. Not healthy crying. The crying where you get dehydrated, soak your clothing in snot, loose any hope in human connection, life, or the future. The kind of crying that eventually makes you nauseous from crying more than you ate that day. The crying that gives you a sinus headache for hours, if not days afterwards. 

CW: Mention of Suicidal thoughts and Self-Harm

It's the kind of crying and pain that while you're experiencing it, you want to hurl yourself off of a building top, or slash your wrists with an exacto knife.  It is the kind of pain that you keep to yourself because most people would not know what to do with it. It is the kind of emotional dysregulation that makes you wonder if you will ever feel safe, connected, and whole around other human beings. It makes you wonder why such pain is allowed to exist in the universe. The despair of being safe but not feeling it, of being loved but not knowing it. 

I am thankful to say that I did not harm myself and that those thoughts have lessened. It worries me; however, to know how strong, intrusive, and present they were today. It has been about 6 months since they were that strong. Which is a huge personal milestone I am saddened to restart. 

So, I have arrived here, to seek people who might relate with non-judgement-- rather than holding it in until I am hospitalized... 

What helps you in your moments of despair?"
A constant overwhelming voice in my head.,12,micnsl,3,"I can be happy but still in the back of my head is my voice, ""I just want to die."" 

All the time. And I don't necessarily feel depressed and I definitely don't intend on acting on it, it's just there. Probably about 50 times a day. At least. Probably a lot more."
What to bring to residential treatment?,4,miclbq,3,"I’m going to be going to residential treatment again soon. I can’t remember what I did and didn’t bring last time, as it was over a year ago. 

Any tips on things that are good to bring to residential? I’m trying to think some things through but I’d love to hear others opinions as well. 

Thank you so much."
how do you control your overthinking?,7,micgvm,1,"i overthink so much that my FP is gonna leave me and hates me, i purposely look at his ig followers and snapscore to see if he’s ignoring me/ seeing other girls. and i know i should stop, because i’m enabling my behavior but it makes me SO ANXIOUS if i don’t look. he’s told me multiple times to stop overthinking so much but it’s so hard to. distracting myself doesnt rlly work"
my bpd ruined my relationship with someone I really loved. Idk if I can take this anymore,1,micgla,0,"I feel so worthless, I missed a few days of my cymbalta and went crazy. I scratched him and left bloody marks. His mom made me block him and called the cops on both of us. I can’t believe I did that.

people never change,2,micewu,1,"I guess the guy who gaslights you then ghosts you for over a year doesn't really change when he comes back, not at all how you had imagined he'd finally come back and apologize. I thought I was the issue, but now that he was an awful person to me, omly coming back to taint the pain he caused me. My pain finally feels valid, I needed that separation to understand that I'm not always the problem..I wish wasn't so harsh on myself. I don't know?"
Friend won't talk about how they feel. What is the right approach?,7,mibqls,3,"Sorry, unsure where to ask this question.

My friend with (BPD) seems to have a very tough time with talking about their emotions, or things that are bothering them. I'm not sure if they are upset with me at times, but it really seems like it. When I ask them if they are okay, or if they want to talk about it, they won't really answer me, they just say I don't know. They just won't tell me.

So I just let them know that I'm here for them, and to talk to me when they'd like. Is that going about it the wrong way? I just don't want to seem pushy. 
Should I initiate more conversation with them? Or just leave it as is until they feel like talking?"
Is anyone else sick of coupledom in movies?,2,mibq6a,0,"All I see in movies is perfect people in perfect relationships.

I can't stand how far away from these characters I feel.

Dear Mom [Letter][Venting],11,miavzy,3,"When I was a little girl, I believed I was living with a monster.

I didn't have any words to speak then. Under the threat of constant volatility at home, I learned to keep to myself. We all did. We were four strangers living in our own dark corners.

At school, I was isolated. Your paranoia and jealousy prevented me from getting close to anyone. Your disapproval was worse.

As I was rarely allowed permission to go outside, I found some semblance of life on my computer. The virtual reality allowed me to detach from my own mind.

I built myself a door behind my eyes so that I could lock all the wrong away. I threw chains on it, and watched it burn. My form of coping was suppression then, until it evolved. I started using knives.

I have picked my skin bloody ever since I was a baby. You were sure it was allergies. 

I cried myself to sleep most nights. You were sure it was just childhood moodiness.  You assured me on occasion, that you could give me something to truly cry about.

 I looked for means of escape. You assumed I was seeking attention, and twisted my words against me. You imbedded the guilt deeply. 

I do not remember you ever smiling.  Why couldn't you see what was happening? The rifts between us took years to form. I know I loved you, even though you hurt me.

&#x200B;

I am an adult now. My own woman. Although, I do not have any sense of a personal identity. I have finally received a name for the mental agony now. Borderline Personality Disorder. I wonder if this was your affliction too.

I know now you were not a monster. You were suffering. Your trauma kept you awake at night, and took your appetite away. The very way you lived was to escape. You were barely functioning. You were lashing out of pain, and because it was what you were taught to do. You never learned how to cope with it all, and it kept adding up. I wish you could have been able to open your mind to treatment. You always said you were a strong woman. Perhaps you were, to your own detriment.

I don't think you ever understood what was happening then.                                                                           I wonder if you were a hostage in your mind and the mother I knew was not you at all.

I can't honestly say I miss you, as you were. I miss the thought of having a mother, though.

I can't honestly say I love you. But I can't feel much at all. I have learned to wear my masks for the necessary occasions. I laugh on que, smile when expected. But I cannot do the same for love.         Inside, there is an ever-growing, twisting knot.

When I look in the mirror, there you are. Your disapproving look gives you away.

In the corners of my bedroom, there you are. The guilt you sowed won't leave me.

When I abuse the person I care for most and send my world spiraling for another time, I feel you with me.

I hated you out of my pain. 

I tried to die, mom. I begged to die. My body didn't, though. Some wounds healed long ago, it's the ones beneath the skin that never did.

&#x200B;

I don't know if you'll ever hear these words before you're gone. Even now, you are the greatest living shadow in my heart. In your presence, I will be reduced to nothing but a dependent child again. Will you ensure a sense of safety with your hugs, then proceed to rip me apart?

I don't know if this is goodbye. But I know I am beginning to let go. I will wash my pain away with years to come of soul-searching and acceptance. I hope that you can still choose to get help."
Does anyone ever cut people off before they can leave them,22,miathg,6,I feel so empty and shallow and disgusting but project my anger on others cause I don’t think it’s fair but I really hate what I did and then I’m too scared to ask for apology as they leave me. I hate being self sabotaging. (Just lost another relationship yay me time to repeat a cycle of torment)
"I think I figured something out about people wanting to assume anyone who's a pain for ""no reason"" is borderline",1,miaoym,1,"I didn't know what to flair this as so I chose venting, but if there's a better one please let me know.

I was browsing one of the subs that mostly seems to be creative writing at this point, and in it, someone was describing a problematic roommate as someone they ""thought had something wrong mentally, we think borderline"", and I just stopped and thought for a bit. 

See, I'm on the younger side, so I researched mental illnesses as best I could so that when I could start therapy in a safe environment(ie not living with my parents), I could at least try to be helpful and use more descriptive terms as to how I was feeling. Eventually I gave my therapist the list of things I felt, and over the course of a few months she was like ""most likely borderline, however I try to not give a strict diagnosis until I meet in person"", so I'm tentatively bpd(? idk thats a different post). 

However, I did delve into cluster b type personality disorders, and so I learned a bit about histronic, narcissitic, and antisocial(but I think that's the outdated term and I can't remember the right one right now and I gotta get this thought out of my system before I forget)

Well, a good portion of symptoms in the clusters of disorders are similiar, so basically what I'm getting at is that what most people perceive as borderline might actually be histronic. There's a lot more behaviours that fall under histronic than borderline in posts where people are ""they're probably borderline but undiagnosed"". 

Now I'm not trying to use hpd as the ""see, look, bpd isn't bad!"" because honestly anything mentally impairing left untreated is awful. I'm saying this more as ""people need to be educated more period because it's not fair to mislabel someone and use certain illnesses as scapegoats"". 

And yes, immediately jumping to ""this person I don't like is mentally ill"" is a thing that should really be stopped, because yknow, people can just be assholes and that's not an illness, that's just being a piece of shit. 

For me though, I like to actually see if someone is in crisis and needs help, yknow? Like, ""hey, I think you might want to talk to someone, you're exhibiting some behaviours that can actually be changed through therapy and increase your quality of life"". Idk, I mean I'd like it if someone had gently nudged me in the right direction years ago, like my school counselors or whatever they're called should have, but I digress.

Also I know that might not be helpful in some cases because mental health isn't cheap, but offering the olive branch and maybe some free resources to help people ground themselves can make a difference that would be much preferable than doing nothing.

Idk, this was just a thought I had and I wanted to share it somewhere with people that would probably understand. If you read my word vomit, thank you, and I apologize if I offended anyone, it was not my intent. If I did offend, please let me know so maybe I can clairfy my thoughts better, I swear I don't mean to attack anyone with this post."
BPD and Pregnancy/Children,7,miabzg,6,"24F borderline here. I’ve always wanted to be a Mum, but I constantly find myself getting overwhelmed thinking about how my mental illness will affect my child/children. 

When I picture the future in my head, I know when I’m having good days I’ll be the most loving caring kind mother ever. And I can’t wait to teach my children to be open about mental health. But then I quickly spiral and start thinking about... how am I going to care for them when I’m having my bad days? We all know that bad days for us are BAD. 

I’m lucky to have such a supportive partner and he will be the most caring beautiful dad ever. But I’m scared and feel almost selfish for bringing children into the world that I may negatively affect for their entire lives because of my illness. 

Thoughts and experiences are welcome."
I can’t stand myself when I lose my empathy. But then again at the time I don’t really care because I have no empathy. That scares me.,44,mia01w,10,"Usually I feel like I’m full of compassion and empathy for others. But other times I know I can be so cold, so not understanding. I don’t like that side of me, unless I’m in that moment. In that moment it’s great to be able to cut off the emotion for a second. Ahh forever in constant battles with myself."
DAE feel depressed and maybe s*icidal after hanging out with people? (Even when it was a good time),513,mi9yug,71,"No matter who I hang out with, or how good it was, I'll always feel empty and depressed after we finish hanging out. It happens all the time to the point where I dred having to end hang outs but that's not realistic or fair on them ofc.

I guess it has alot to do with the fact that I'll probably never see them again cuz they might abandon me, they might internally hate me, me not knowing who I am, and so on. Its hard for me to not feel awful after a good day out with people and I hate this instability"
TIL about BPD and recognized myself immediately,9,mi9snd,0,"I wasn't searching for it.  I actually started to look into it after reading a synopsis of Maniacs.  I recognized myself immediately and I felt such relief.  Just the relief of knowing that what I am has a name.  Relief at the fact that no, there is nothing inherently wrong with me, there is a real reason to all this madness.  I had intense suicidal ideations today.  Instead of taking them a step further I picked up the phone and got on a crisis hotline.  They then referred me to a crisis centre near me and from there I was given the info for a walk in near me so I could get a psychiatrist referral since I do not have a family doctor.  I booked online and got an appointment same day.  Spoke to the doctor and told her that I recognized myself after reading the symptoms of BPD and the experiences of others with BPD. But I needed a referral because I wanted an actual diagnosis. She wholeheartedly agreed.  Both with my belief that I do have BPD and me needing professional help.  She also confirmed that NO ONE wants to be diagnosed with this.  This is seen as one of the worst diagnosis' to have and it is often misdiagnosed. Idgaf.  The relief of having a name to my madness is immense.  It will make looking for help easier as I now know exactly what I need help for.  Immediately signed up for reddit to get involved in this community.  It obviously is not great that I feel as f\*cked up as I do at times but f\*ck at least I know concretely that I am not alone.  Hopefully I can find some comfort here."
What do I do when my fear of abandonment becomes real?,8,mi9rl3,6,"My favorite person got mad at me for taking up too much of his time with my sadness and emotions. We’re long distance but usually talk every day. However, he lashed out yesterday and is giving me the silent treatment. I feel awful. My world is spinning. I’ve been crying all day. Support and help would be much appreciated."
I wish it weren't creepy to reach out to someone who used to be a client/patient at a place I worked.,2,mi9ghk,3,"I was going to ask for perspective on something, but decided against it because I think I know the answer to my question; instead I just want to vent a bit about something that's been making me sad for more than a day, cause it'd be nice to just get it outta my brain.

More than ten years ago I was working in short term mental health treatment facility; at the time I was only aware of my ocd and bipolar 1, but I still found myself being the only of my coworkers without an (irrational/prejudicial) dislike or difficulty with the people who came to us with borderline diagnoses or those who occasionally used self harm as a coping skill, and I always felt a particualr affinity for all of the people there who were desperately asking to be listened to, and met with unhearing, uncaring ears. 

( Since then I've self diagnosed on the borderline front so take that for what you will. This, like nearly everything, is subjective, and I don't intend to get a diagnosis, just based on how I heard ""Professionals"" talk about people with borderline personality disorder)

I've also quit working in mental health and have been trying to do what I can in other ways. Not only was I tired of the stress and bad pay; I felt like most of what I did that seemed to actually help people was made harder or impossible by the oppressive hierarchies, dehumanizing rhetoric, and carceral logic (the list goes on...) Of the institutions I was a part of. 

The relationships you build with people when you're in a position of power over them like that are obviously always one sided, largely involuntary, and shallow; but I did and do still care deeply for so many of the people I had the privilege to meet during their most vulnerable moments, and I tried to honestly and compassionately lighten that load as much as I could. 

Since figuring out that DBT works for some problems I've always had and never solved, and giving myself my aforementioned (admittedly subjective) self diagnosis, 
I keep wishing it were appropriate to reach out to someone who was often a client at the place I worked. But it's just a whole different set of circumstances when you were in a position of power over someone. 

I often wonder how they're doing and hope that they're ok and relatively happy. 
But I'm pretty sure that reaching out even to see how they're doing would be Intrusive, creepy, inappropriate, destabilising, rude, or some other word for not a kind thing to do to someone I only want the best for. 
(it probably is also a violation of professional ethics, but with a few exceptions, those are to protect professionals not the people they're treating)

Also after getting the feel that this is even a creepy ~impulse~ to have, I feel like maybe my boundaries aren't as solid as I like to think they are (around certain stuff). Like, I don't like that I'm over here being all, ""well if I were in their situation I would want me to reach out"" like... projection cause I'm lonely much?

Anyhow. 
Thanks for reading."
A little bit of help for a 35 year old boy,1,mi9cs3,1,"Hello all.
 I've only been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, Within the last 3 months.

Doing my own research I believe I have had it  since I   was a young child.

 I get to see my children for the 1st time in over a year and a 1/2.

 My ex wife has moved on and is in a very happy relationship.
 But I still have to pick her up from the airport.

And to be honest I'm finding it very difficult.

 I'd love to know what some of you people think."
Always downplaying my struggles,11,mi9ab1,2,"Whenever I stop to think I’m always like “maybe I’m just dramatic. Maybe it’s not that bad” and then remember my mental illnesses are literally crippling and I can’t perform normal tasks. So why am I even telling myself that as if I forgot I fail everything cus I can’t maintain anything that requires commitment. 

And sometimes I think to myself “maybe I’m just dramatic and can’t like handle everyday life” and I don’t understand why I use this to discredit my struggles because that’s literally what a lot of bpd is, overwhelmingly emotional and not being able to cope with small stressors so of course I can’t handle everyday life??? I don’t understand what I’m saying to myself most of the time. Like what even is this loll it doesn’t make sense."
Guilt,4,mi8zrq,1,"Not having a particularly good week. 

I ran into my ex who is back at his old job, and at first it just startled me, we haven't spoken since I went off on him for dating someone new so quickly and that was.. not pretty.

I had thought ""well whatever bet it ruined his day too"" but then I started thinking about *why* it could ruin his day, which then spiraled into thinking about what a horrible girlfriend I was. 

I just truly hate how awful I was and I wish i could apologize, which I have absolutely not allowed myself to reach out because I don't want to cause him anymore distress.  I've gone and looked at messages where I've profusely apologized for my behavior, then not long later I see a message of complete rage. I know this feeling of remorse, and I know what's right after. 

So dealing with LOTS feelings of regret, shame and embarrassment this week."
Can anyone else share how your bpd symptoms effect your job and vice versa?,1,mi8vzl,0,"I’ll start. I find it’s really difficult for me to mask my symptoms, especially when I’m extremely angry, like I’ve literally gone to the bathroom to punch myself in the face because I was so mad(which would have been a pretty funny thing to walk in on tbh). It’s also really hard for me to focus when I’m having such intense emotions(and it doesn’t help that I have unmedicated ADHD) and sometimes I feel physically uncomfortable with my emotions because I have no way to let it out appropriately for the work place. Workplace relationships are also really weird, I find myself splitting  pretty badly on my coworkers and blowing up at them and then regretting it immediately. Working has also had a lot of good effects on me too though. I feel like I do a good job a lot of the time. My boss is also very supportive and always tells me that I’m doing good work which is very kind, especially because I have really low self esteem. I’m also a lot of the times so tired at the end of the day that I don’t have the energy to do the self destructive stuff I would do normally. Having a routine keeps me on the wagon in terms of addiction, but I find myself feeling really really empty and I want to quit and move across the country tomorrow and have a more exciting life but I know that is a bad idea because this job is a good opportunity for me and I haven’t even been there a year. Working with sharp objects makes me nervous, but so far that’s been ok. Ive been more hyper sexual with my coworkers and have had sex with 2 of them"
terrified of returning normality,8,mi8nyx,2,"I’m scared of having to share my FP with the rest of the world now that lockdown is slowly easing. My FP is my boyfriend who I live with and is very understanding, we’ve been in ‘quarantine’ since October, both working full time but spending every free moment intensely in love with each other with no one else around. 
Now we’re able to meet people outside from different households, he’s being invited to go hang out with friends. Though I could tag along I don’t feel like adapting myself to suit people in social situations anymore. Maybe it’s so long going without social interactions, I’ve developed some terrible anxiety in being caught out of ‘not being my authentic self’ or some shit. I think not having a social outlet for bpd sufferers is very damaging, especially when one has progressively made progress. 

Anyway I’ve been having these meltdowns where I’ll scream and cry in the pain of anxiety that makes my skin boil, if it’s even in the realm of possibility that I’ll be left alone without my partner,, or have to share his company with someone potentially ‘unsafe’. I feel fucking selfish and so so guilty, a toxic, crazy human. I wish for once I didn’t have to watch myself ruin everything I have.  Ugh. Codependency amirite."
32 and still cutting,3,mi8mv8,5,"Well, the title says it all... I cut when I was a teenager, and stopped for a very long time. Even got tattoos on my wrists for this very reason. Wouldn't want to tempt myself with destroying a work of art, now would I... but in the past couple of years, BPD has reared it's ugly head again... and now I've been sucked back into the vicious cycle of releasing emotional and mental anguish through physical affirmation, if you will... what a way to live... not really looking for much here... maybe just to know that there are people like me out there..."
How do u navigate getting drunk/drinking with BPD??,6,mi87vq,17,"Hi guys. This is just a general question. How do you guys find alcohol and BPD mix?? I usually message 
my favourite people and then hate myself and feel annoying after. I also think I binge drink in the sense that whenever I drink, it’s a whole thing and I don’t just drink a little, I drink wayyy too much. Both my doctor and therapist said I shouldn’t drink at all cos it makes me even more impulsive and I say I don’t to them but I do. How does everyone else find drinking with BPD??"
DAE feel like their BPD is just another entity in your brain? Not actually a part of you?,6,mi7vh4,1,"This may make no sense and I only really started coming to this conclusion when I was talking to a friend about it and said ""I feel like I'm in the backseat of a car that just keeps crashing and I'm screaming for them to stop and they just keep going."" That was in reference to how I overshare and catch myself but just. keep. going. 

Now I'm journaling and I have never seen myself talk so mean to myself. I think I actually am just yelling at this BPD entity in my mind. There have always been two voices in my head that are in CONSTANT argument and never shut up and I think once I started journaling, I was just going off on that side of my brain.

Now that I think about it, I do feel like I may actually have a personality. I may actually be an individual who has personality traits that aren't just complaining about BPD and my challenges. But, the BPD entity in my mind is always more powerful. It can never pause for a second and is always ruining my life. I don't know, this post was mostly a word dump but its also here because I need a bit of reassurance that this isn't just me being like... crazy ;-;"
does anyone else sort of “force” themselves to split / become careless?,21,mi7eod,14,"today, i saw something that my FP did that made me very upset. so upset i am forcing myself to become careless, but in the process i can sort of “feel” myself splitting. now i am forcing myself to see the person as a piece of shit who doesn’t deserve my time. i am now conflicted. because my brain is telling me something but my heart and my actions are saying otherwise."
I cant stop stalking him!,1,mi6smz,1,"I dont know what it is.

We have had a falling out due to one of my spectacular outbursts.

But i cant stop obsessing over him.

I cant stop wondering why he hasnt text me even though it was me that never replied to his text this morning.

I cant stop checking if he has been on whatsapp.

I cant stop checking what he is doing on playstation.

Its driving me mad!

I know its reasonable for people in relationships to take a breather if they had a big argument.

I know its not healthy to obsessively online stalk him but i keep doing it!

And then i get upset because hes being all normal and im sat here like a possessed dog.

How the fuck do i stop this!?!?!?!"
My therapist wants me to face something I don't want,1,mi6pv1,3,"I am being exposed to one of my worst triggers ever: accepting that my bf has pretty female friends and being okay with him having them in his life.

Now, this whole thing got messed up to me because the most ""threatening"" one moved to where we live. As I want to keep my relationship she is trying to make me prepared to accept this situation and roll with it.

Since the trigger, I do not have confidence nor peace of mind. I am confidence-wise at my lowest point where I cry or feel sad just by seeing myself in the mirror. This is a huge change because I started to believe that I am attractive after so many reassurances and confidence building.

I feel like I keep blocking my therapist too, and I just cannot face it. My brain tries to run away, hide, dissociate, it has everything to not have to face this issue. I am usually trying very hard and I am super open to confront all my traumas, even if it is super hurtful but this... I have never experienced such resistance. 

&#x200B;

Did you? Do you have any advice? I am so confused. I feel like my recovery just went back to -37928923."
Is it possible to have a fp months after ending the friendship? + Is this splitting?,1,mi63do,0,"I started being friends with this person nearly a year ago and towards the end we got very close (basically in a relationship..?) but i was very distant and uncomfortable with it. Something happened between us (I found out they said some shit about me) and i immediately cut them off and didn’t seem to feel anything towards them, a few weeks later and i started to miss them, kept checking their social media and everything seemed much worse because they’re gone. my view of them switches from “i miss them, i’m sure i can meet up with them again, it will be embarrassing but i can get drunk so it’ll be okay, it’ll be worth it, i want to see them again” to “i hate them. i hate their face, their voice, everything about them annoys me and i don’t want anything to do with them anymore”
What’s that about?"
Why do I hate my birthday?,54,mi5pq3,19,"Looking for some insight here. Every year, without fail, my birthday comes arond and I am *downright miserable* for like a week or two. Last year I broke my hand *on* my birthday.

My self-image splits badly all the time anyway, and now there's all this attention on me and obligations to make plans with family. But then it seems like nobody cares at the same time. 

Anyway, I flaired this DAE because I'm curious if anyone else hates their birthday or rock bottoms at a certain time of year (with no specific trauma associated with the date, I guess)"
"Since the lockdown I've been falling back into bad habits like lying a lot, help",2,mi5ahu,0,"The worst lie I told is to a guy I barely know (but that knows some people that I know) through Instagram dms and I'm afraid this lie is gonna be used against me idk how to take it back because I don't know if the lie is worse than the fact that I lied, I'm spiraling I can't stop thinking about it, what should I do?

P.s. It was a month ago and I'm still obsessing about it"
Looking for BPD resources,2,mi59v8,2,"My therapist believes I have PTSD but lately I've been reading about the traits of BPD. I don't know what I have. I made an intake appt at a behavioral health center that does individual and group DBT. I am horribly ashamed at all of the things I've done, and they all repeat in my head every day. I'm in full isolation now for 3rd week. I just have two people that do daily safety checks on me over text. I had hope that DBT and EMDR would help but reading about them sounds so hard. I am so sorry everyone that has to go through this. I didn't realize I was an abuser. I never wanted this."
ppl with bpd are nothing more than a virus and a joke,9,mi4t3c,5,"april fools!

i actually did hear this from someone and it got to my head 

humans can be little shits sometimes, but yanno if u wouldnt listen to an absolute dickhead then why listen to those who say that. theyre more of a joke and a virus than we are

it stings regardless but we are super strong to be able to deal with whats in our heads AND those peoples judgement.

go get out of bed and have a nice bath yall, maybe cook yourselves smth if ud like  
u deserve it !!!"

What are the differences?,3,mi4eda,1,"Fear of abandonment versus trust issues versus fear of rejection. Is this similar? What differences are there between trust issues (worrying about being hurt) outright and a fear of abandonment?

Recently diagnosed and feeling lost,3,mi4akj,3,"I've recently been diagnosed with BPD and I've found it really hard to accept. I feel so confused all the time because I don't know if anything is truly me or my BPD? I feel so out of touch with myself I just feel like I'm lying all the time.

I've bottled everything up until it all came out last month and I ended up in A&E over suicidal thoughts and being blackout drunk. Since this, I don't feel like I can put the lid back on. Like I know I'm going to receive support but I almost don't want it? I've been trying to contain how I feel for so long now that I just feel like I should ruin everything and be reckless.

Are these normal feelings? I'm just tired of being confused and questioning myself all the time.

Thanks for reading :)"
"Life feels like I am drowning and even though I know how to swim, I just don't have the motivation to",11,mi48v7,2,"Don't even know if this makes sense, but I feel like there is so much I want to do and so much that I want to achieve but I can't. 

Every day I feel like I am drowning deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of hating myself and ruining my life one step at a time. I sabotage my health by not working out or by eating too much whenever I see any progress in the mirror. I sabotage my work by being distracted and on my phone or on any social media. I sabotage my friendships and family connections by being completely detached from them and not being interested unless everything is about me. I sabotage my relationships by being way too clingy and demanding attention 24/7 till I scare the person away. 

My head hurts from not sleeping enough but I'd rather scroll through my fucking email than sleep at a reasonable time. I know how the way to save myself from drowning is simply eating better, meditating, sleeping more, listening to others, stop judging myself by how my body looks, working with complete focus, not chasing after romantic relationships and taking them slow.

But here is the problem: I have no motivation to do any if these things. I really want to. But I always get some mental block that keeps making my life more and more miserable. I feel like I should just give up and drown myself completely"
Apps for BPD,2,mi419d,3,"Anyone know of any helpful apps for bpd? Not just talking about self help apps, also any kind of app games that people play to help them calm down?

DAE feel like they're losing all their friends because they didn't nurture their friendships?,2,mi40e0,0,"I spent a lot of time with my FP last year and because of this I neglected to reach out to my friends as much as I used to. However, I noticed that when I stopped making an effort with my friends, nobody reciprocated that effort with me. I have always been the person who sets up plans, decides what we do and when we hang out, and makes an effort to reach out to people and check in on how they're doing. None of my friends have done that with me since I stopped making as much of an effort.

It really bothers me because even when I was completely absorbed with my FP, I STILL made an effort to check in every once in a while. 

I feel torn between blaming myself for letting these friendships burn out and angry at the people I thought were my friends because now I feel like our friendships were one-sided. 

No matter how much I try to validate that they also have shit going on in their lives that I probably don't know about, it still makes me feel very upset and very alone... 

I am afraid to drop these friendships because I don't feel like I won't have any friends left if I do. It's been a long time since I've had to make friends and I feel like I don't know how to anymore. Really stuck and don't know what to do. I'm sorry for rambling. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :/"
I want to be totally alone for a long time,12,mi3u1u,2,"I'm considering just running into the woods and staying there. If I don't know how to survive then, oh well. Not like being alive is pleasant.

Kudos to anyone still pushing forward despite being traumatized and terrorized by their parents...,41,mi3qju,7,"I have never been close to my mother. There is not any age that I remember where I was not fearful of her or felt comfortable around her, and frankly, I am at a point where I don't want her love or approval. She has always been manipulative, emotionally abusive, and sometimes borderline physically abusive. Even though I am an ""adult"" now (I really don't feel like one), I have never been able to escape her because of our financial predicaments and other family matters. I've been able to avoid her toxicity for a few months now, but today she did something completely unfair that made me so angry and stressed me out. I ended up scratching the skin on my thighs to the point of drawing blood and almost started pulling my hair out. I have had these urges before after talking to her but always been able to manage my feelings. Venting here definitely helps. I just feel like crying all the time and I want to disappear. I don't feel comfortable in my own home and I never have before."
"I still miss my FP every day, over 2 years later",50,mi38i2,8,"The last time I heard from my FP was the beginning of 2019. We had a very toxic up and down relationship, we were both pieces of shit sometimes. I pushed him too far and he left for good. I lost it, I blew up his phone, screamed, cried, hurt myself in protest, checked his location every 5 minutes, did all the things that I now know only made it worse. I had never felt pain like that before. I couldn’t eat or sleep for days. I wanted to die.

I miss him so much. I feel like everything has been grey since he left. I haven’t had a single day that I have felt true joy. I’ve had some days that are decent, some even good. But nothing like before, nothing like when he was still in my life. Most of the time I still idolize him, I feel like my life would be perfect if he came back. But sometimes I hate him, I hope he is miserable, I hope he is alone and has no one, I hope he regrets everything. 

I’m so fucking exhausted. I still measure everything in my life back to the day he left. I still think of him every time I experience anything, and imagine what it would be like if he was still a part of it. I still think about him every single day, no matter how far I try to distance myself. I did everything, blocked number, blocked social media, different state, zero contact. It never ends. I am so fucking tired."
"Constantly think and bring up suicide when venting, or talking to my therapist. Ruining all my relationships, but they are genuine thoughts.",3,mi37df,2,"Basically the title. When things dont go the way i want them, i start getting extremely angry and argumentative. And then as I continue to argue with others, whether it be therapists, people in servers, friends, hotlines, the ER when i've been admitted, etc, I just start wanting to give up on everything and think about dying. Of course when i mention this, people think im being manipulative or threatening suicide... That's such horse shit. I always have been, and will continue to be a victim, i mean thats all i am with this shitty hand ive been dealt when i was born. And i continue to suffer by staying alive..."
Trying to form an identity,8,mi2wha,4,"I'm not officially diagnosed with BPD, but have been going to therapy for many years. It was suspected at one point but dropped as a diagnosis just as quickly. I've spent most of my time going in circles around anxiety and depression, oscillating back-and-forth, often times cycling several times a week between feeling good to feeling like I want to die. Sometimes within the space of a day. I just wanted to add this as a disclaimer to try and be respectful to those who have an official diagnosis.

I've also struggled with finding a strong sense of self. With self-esteem. Forming an identity has always felt very arbitrary; depending on who I am around. This became apparent when people close to me over the years have expressed surprise at seeing a ""different side of me"" that they hadn't seen before, but may have come out in a party setting in which they were present, for example. But then I'd be the opposite in another setting or even in the same setting but around different people, and after a while it felt like I was having an identity crisis. I didn't know who I was.

Partly I explain it by an obsession I have with being liked. Growing up I'd have lots of fantasies about how conversations would go, or ought to go, and what I would say. Trying to have the perfect answer for everything. Rehearsing for mundane interactions. Coming up with jokes. And also beating myself up over small mistakes where I may have said the wrong thing, done something embarrassing or whatever.

On the one hand it's helped me network. On the other, it made having lasting, deep, \*real\* friendships with people very difficult, though I manage to still have a few best friends. Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit about my efforts to form a stronger self identity in hopes that it might help another person.

I have found that having a revolving door of interests and obsessions and latching onto them has led me to have a wide variety of interests, and helps me relate to others. It helps me make interesting discussion, at the risk of seeming random or off-topic. But most importantly, I've been trying to extract out the commonalities, comparing and contrasting and synthesizing my eclectic tastes, to try and find more solid ground.

For example. One characteristic I found was pithy. I often enjoy things that are very emotionally evocative, such as music genres like mid-west emo, and specific bands. Through music and other art I can relate to what's being expressed. Sure, maybe I can't relate to it all the time, but I can relate to it now-and-again, and that's enough for me.

Another thing is that I'm a real aesthete. At the expense of kind of being judgmental about appearances, I enjoy beautiful things. It doesn't just have to be beautiful people. It can be music that I think is really beautifully arranged, a work of art, a photograph, real places on our planet, a movie or anime, etc.

I guess my point I'm trying to make is that \*maybe\* you can try extracting some qualities out of your likes or interests that aren't superficial. That is to say, yeah, ""emo music"" might just be a phase for you, or a new artist or author or what have you, but that there is something timeless underlying that thing that is intuitive to you.

In the same sense that your birth-date is an unchanging part of your identity, what helped me is trying to piece together and add more unchanging parts. You have to dig really deep, but it's there. I think this is why Jung's work with the archetypes resonated so well with me. I think this is why I tend to argue from first principles rather than what is expedient. I think this is why I hate hypocrisy, because I've so often felt like a walking contradiction.

I've noticed that a lot of diagnosed BPD individuals seek internal-consistency. All this turbulence and volatility hurts other people, yes, but we're well aware that it hurts us, too. They might not see it or experience it, so they don't know how much we beat ourselves up, and this feeling of doom that we'll always hurt other people, and that we don't deserve love, and that we'll never be better.

So I think trying to establish even just some small nuggets of consistency in our identity can go a long way, in the same way that sticking to a practical daily routine as best you can will help a lot. Or in the same way that it might be better building an internal locus of control, rather than having an entirely external locus of control where we put our whole heart and mind in the hands of a partner, a responsibility far too great to bear. Feel free to share your thoughts on this, or talk about what has helped you in your journey."
"“Even on my worst days, there’s always more right than wrong with me.”",16,mi2jy3,2,"Above is a quote from a youtube video. I don’t think the video was about BPD, but the second I heard this quote, something shifted within me. I felt lighter. 

Now, I have it on a post-it note on the wall behind my desk. Whenever I start to feel down about myself, I look at this quote & repeat it like a mantra. It works like a charm everytime, and even causes me to tear up a little from the warmth I feel within myself, instead of the feeling of emptiness that tends to take over when I feel down about my flaws.

I really hope this quote helps at least one other person to feel the way I do whenever I read it :)"
How do you manage on days you dont feel yourself?,7,mi23pu,2,"Yesterday I felt amazing and filled with positive energy and hope. Today is the opposite. I seen shades of black and feel detached.

First DBT therapy success!!,2,mi1wle,1,"First time going through the DBT process and I actually feel really good. Looking forward to the future for once and smiling. Love you guys, keep pushing and striving to get better / We can do this :)

Also highly suggest DBT!"
DAE have practically have every symptom of BPD except intense anger?,10,mi1rko,9,"So I was diagnosed with BPD 7 months ago and when I hear people without BPD talk about their perceptions of BPD, they talk about someone who is impulsive and has explosive anger. While I’m impulsive, I’ve never had uncontrollable or intense anger. I looked up the 9 criteria for BPD and I have every single one except the intense anger. I was wondering if anyone else could relate."

Struggling with affirmations - do they actually work?,1,mi1o5b,1,"My therapist keeps telling me to say affirmations to myself like ""I am fine just the way I am"" & whatnot but despite months of being told to do this, I still struggle with actually doing it. I feel like affirmations are trite & don't actually make a difference, & I'm afraid of gaslighting myself into thinking I have fixed things when really I am just lying to myself. I used to be super into the personal development community & gaslit myself into thinking I wasn't mentally ill so I could fit in with the group & be ""high level"" but that really ended up backfiring so the idea of affirmations still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I'm a self-aware person with BPD & logically know in tough situations that what I am feeling might not be true but trying to say affirmations to myself when stuff like that happens seems useless & trite, not to mention I often forget to say it. 

I don't know if being neurodivergent, with ADHD & likely autism according to my therapist, has anything to do with WHY affirmations seem so much harder for me than my therapist thinks they should be. I am good at WRITING words but less eloquent about knowing what to say when speaking, & I am a visual & experience learner, not an auditory learner so maybe I'm just not connecting with words specifically? Does anyone have a workaround for this? I've tried explaining my difficulties with this to my therapist but I don't think I explained it well, & it's super frustrating for me to try doing something but not being able to make it work yet, despite MONTHS of trying."
"I would kill for a hug, but I would also kill the person that tries to hug me.",2,mi1mr0,0,"When I was 19 years old I was severely sexually abused many times and since then my life hasn't really been the same.  
I just want someone to randomly hug me. I really want that. But at the same I feel like I would probably just push that person away and punch their face. It feels gross when humans touch my skin.  
It feels like a dirt stain on my skin and I can't wash it off.  
I pull people close and then just literally throw them away.

&#x200B;

Also: I didn't even get any support after reporting that I was raped multiple times by the people I used to live with. Is it cos' I'm male? :( Other people that have been abused or beaten, they get taken care of very well. But they're all women actually.. just confuses me :("
DAE feel like their brain WANTS them to be miserable?,168,mi1gbv,25," My borderline manifests itself as constant, uncontrollable, racing intrusive thoughts, that are extremely difficult to manage in day-to-day life. I'm essentially trying to fight a voice in my head telling me I'm worthless 24/7. This intersects with my ADHD in that it takes enormous amounts of effort to concentrate on tasks.   


Sometimes my mind will get stuck on traumatic things that happened months or even years ago, and I'll relive the entire emotional experience of the event as though it were happening now. It feels impossible for me to move on from things that have happened, either things I've done to others or things others have done to me. I feel as though I am defined by these mistakes, as though I can never be worth more than the worst things I've done or the abuse I experienced from others.   


Sometimes my brain will conjure up absurd scenarios of potentially painful situations that would likely never occur. For example, I live in the same town as my ex, and I have a constant fear of seeing him in public. I feel like I have to ""prepare"" myself mentally for that situation in case it actually happens, but it never does. It's just me giving into my anxiety.   


Sometimes I'll get jealous or insecure about things that don't even have anything to do with me, or things that happened years and years ago that don't bear any weight on the present. I'll often wonder if the people my partner has been with before me were more attractive than I am, or if they were better partners to him, or better at sex than me, etc. Even worse, on occasion my brain pictures them being physical while I'm with him and wonder if I measure up to them (I know it's super gross, it's something I try really hard not to give into because it's a very insecure behavior).   


My self-esteem is low because I feel like there is always someone better than me. I have all of this free-floating self-loathing that I attach to different things; I find new weapons to beat myself up with every day. I feel like my bpd WANTS me to hate myself and that I will never be truly secure in who I am. I often read the advice on here and other places that we are the only people that will be with us our whole lives, so we have to treat ourselves with compassion. This makes sense to me, but feels impossible to achieve. It feels as though my borderline thoughts and tendencies cannot be defeated or separated from my conscious mind. Does anyone else experience this?"
I'd rather die than work full time,430,mi18iu,83,"Right now I am only working 2 days a week and can barely handle it but in the summer I'm supposed to work full time. I fucking dread it. I hate this fucking shit and it is even worse having to work next to a bitch co-worker. Her in a bad mood and being aggressive makes me feel like shit too. I absorb the energy like a sponge, like wtf. It's fucking hell. Then I'm anxious and shit because of her and about to spiral into a mental breakdown. I can't deal with this shit. I'm so fucking over it"
I need help navigating multiple fp’s,2,mi10z9,2,"Just to keep it kind of short, have two fp’s, my girlfriend and a close friend. Neither of them know I have bpd because I don’t want to scare either of them away just the thought of that would is literally unbearable but my question is: how do I deal with having an fp that isn’t my romantic partner??? I idolize, seek approval from, and crave affection and attention from my (sadly) platonic fp but I feel like just admitting that is cheating. I get a massive rush of happiness whenever I see her and no matter what kind of day I’m having I just melt. My feelings of dissonance have only grown after I had a weird dream a couple weeks ago where we kissed and I’ve been replaying it over and over in my head. I’m sorry if I’m just rambling I have no idea how to express what I want or need but some advice would be really helpful please"
I don't know why I'm still alive,11,mi10y8,4,"I'm just venting, its juvenile 

10 years ago I was in graduate school completing my master's and owned my own condo. I was in a relationship (although a terrible one). I had more money than I do now. I was depressed but I felt like I was somebody and had some level of promise. I wish I had killed myself then; it would have meant something then, people would have wondered why. I'm a romantic, I like the idea that in some way my death could have generated some kind of meaning.

Today, I'm diabetic, never finished my degree, and live in a small studio apartment. I've been single for two years, and on sick leave for three. I was humiliated at work because I couldn't hold it all in anymore and was so stressed. This and that happened but now everyone knows my deep dark secrets and laughed in my face about it. Oh and I ended up with some jail time and a criminal record, at least I have my bi-weekly payments to show for it. 

I'm a complete mess and failure now. And I know I can't get better because I know I can't do it on my own and no one will love me in this condition, not for very long anyway. I don't even dare dream about relationships these days, I dream about making enough money so I can see sex workers whenever I want, that seems a more attainable goal. 

Last month someone I was close to stopped talking to me. Every day is hell without her. I'm now completely isolated. I have no one to even talk to, not that I really want to talk to anyone unless I can feel loved somehow. 

I'm not gonna do it. I don't know why I persist in living when everything is so bleak. I don't want to hurt my family and they would feel ashamed if I did it. That's one reason. But it's this hope, this waiting and seeing, the 'you never know's', that really keep alive and I'm sick of it. I'm smart enough to know that my life is highly unlikely to get better. 

And the guilt. I think of things I've done way back in high school and can't sleep at night. Everything is humiliation or a shameful event until I want to peel off my skin. How did I ever sink so low? How did I ever manage to believe I could be better when everyone told me I was supposed to be nothing? 

I feel like I'm in shock most of the time. I'm starting to walk and move slower, my thoughts are just empty. I want to cry but can't or when I do, it's like one burst, and then its stops. There's no release. I want there to be a reason someone should care, but there isn't one. This world is a brutal dark and competitive place and there's no room for weak men like me. 

Literally, the best things in my life right now are cheeseburgers and I still sometimes enjoy watching my hockey team but even that is hard cause so much of my fandom was based on loving my city and I don't have that love anymore. Sounds stupid, I know, but the point is I have no joy anymore. I keeping wanting to say something but I don't know what to say or who to say it to. I really pray that I die in my sleep"
Having to go to the ER for psych eval,3,mi0py1,3,"My therapist and best friend are both pushing me to go to the ER for a psych eval. I really do not want to go, I’m afraid.

tips for living alone?,2,mi0gta,3,"I'm going to be living alone really soon, and I'm quite scared honestly. 

when I have my bad moods, I force myself to be in my roomates company because I know I won't do anything so self destructive when I'm in their company. but I won't be able to do that anymore.

I'm also worried about my routine and habits, such as eating and sleeping. how do I keep myself eating and drinking regularly, and not just sleeping on the sofa whenever I feel tired. I need to keep up routines but I'm not very good at it. and keeping up with cleaning and laundry.

any tips?"
Today’s one of those days where I woke up and realized I had a debilitating mental health disorder,8,mi0asq,2,"I guess the trigger is change. I’m dealing with shame today. And lots of change within the past couple of months. I lost so many friends. I lost family. I’m struggling with this stupid eating disorder. I feel like a ghost floating through space. The only thing keeping me grounded is the eating disorder treatment I’m undergoing. But some days I’m just too depressed to answer messages and respond to phone calls. 

I wish my brain could just fucking act right! Why does it have to be so idiotic? I’m sitting here suffering everyday and I just don’t wanna do it anymore.. 

I’m tired of stealing personality traits from my favorite people/characters. I hate going about life as if it were a movie to cope with my lack of identity/chronic boredom. I’m tired of being hyper sexual only to go through ping pongs of being praise and hated. I’m tired of being the weird girl at work who can’t hold a convo but all the guys want to fuck. The black sheep family member who causes all the problems. The needy and irrational friends who blocks you the minute she feels abandoned. 

Like what. the. actual. fuck."
Just got a job for the first time in a while! advice needed,2,mi01b7,2,"So I haven't worked since 2019, covid played a part in my gap in working but mostly the fact that working has always been very very triggering for me. Not like I have been through something at work and now it triggers me, just like being stuck in the same building for 6-12 hours with multiple expectations and higher ups who expect the best out of me at all times and to know what i'm doing all the time- it's very high stress for me, as i'm sure many of you understand. I normally will work normal for a few months and suppress all of my feelings that aren't ""work appropriate"" (ie anger, depression, anxiety, anxiety attacks, hyperness) until one day one small little thing happens (last time it was literally my boss moved a desk from its normal spot) and i have an episode and get terminated or fired or i quit out of of embarrassment, and then my mental state is so damaged i have to go to an iop or hospital. So all that said, I am super anxious about starting this new job, and am driving myself crazy remembering how painful it was to suppress things all day and how horrible working makes my mental state. I NEED coping skills or things in general that help you get through work if you have a similar experience where work is very triggering. Coping skills I can do in public, affirming statements i can tell myself, helping the time pass shorter- ANYTHING. i want to keep this job for longer than a few months, I want to be normal and do normal 20 year old things lol. Thank you"
bpd kicking in strong after breakup,8,mhz31b,0,"my mind and life is a mess right now. 7 hours or so after the most important person in the world broke up with me been doing nothing but shivering, crying and screaming, feeling like a useless shell of myself. 

and i know that these feelings are going to last for a long time. i can't seem to hold myself together even for a hour and a half. don't have an appetite and the only thing i want to do is purely self destructive drinking, but i know it ain't going to help, so laying in bed for the next week or so seems fine. 

i can't help but to feel like my emotions are absolutely off the charts uncontrollable again and this is going to be hell for a long time. 

fuck."
Words of congratulations and encouragement.,92,mhyhp4,16,"As someone who is not diagnosed with BPD and who does not meet any of the nine traits associated with the disorder, I would like to share my most sincere congratulations to anyone having to deal with such feelings and thoughts on a daily basis. 

Your courage is truly remarkable. I wish peace and health to each and every one of you. Remember that BPD is only a part of who you are and that it does not represent a complete definition of the person that you are."
Why won’t it stop?,3,mhyfxf,2,"If I have irrational thoughts, I can usually identify them pretty quickly. I’ll tell myself in my head, *stop. this is not rational and you don’t need to act on this thought. stop thinking about it*. And sometimes I keep thinking of that thing. Sometimes I don’t. But for the majority of the time, I recognize irrationality and try to stop the thoughts there. So why won’t they stop coming? 

Sometimes I hold myself back from acting inappropriately or irrationally. I tell myself in my head that what I’m doing or about to do will have consequences, and nine times out of ten, those consequences will be negative. I’ve been getting better at stopping myself from behaving a certain way and I think that a lot of the time I **do** succeed at this. So why won’t these temptations stop? 

If I am capable of identifying and stopping irrational thoughts or behaviors, why do I keep doing it? Why won’t my brain get the message? Why haven’t I fully adapted to this over time? Why won’t it stop?"
Trying to choose a DBT workbook to start but there are so many!,1,mhycg9,2,"I know that I need help. The last two years have been the hardest of my life and I’m spiraling.

I have a very hard time with medical professionals because I was injured pretty badly from my ob/gyn making a dumb call that cost me about a decade of pain. Plus, ya know, I’m a naturally paranoid person apparently. So I thought I would get a workbook or two to ease myself into it. But I cannot choose. They either seem too good to be true or like they could do more harm than good. Or maybe I’m just being too picky. 

So I’ll ask y’all. Have you done any of these workbooks on your own? Which did you do and did it help or hurt you? 

I know therapy is my best option. But I have so much anxiety and anger when I think about going that I have to self soothe or I’ll have an anxiety attack. I’m trying my best."
"Feeling really upset that therapist suggested I may have BPD, Narc Fleas, or some BPD traits",0,mhxz9o,3,"Anyone else get really upset when therapist told them they have fleas?

My new personal therapist, who I haven’t known for very long said my FMIL is exhibiting Narc behavior based on what I told her. 

(My old therapist who I saw for 6 years for trauma after having a serious illness / my family distinction passed away unexpectedly about 6 months ago) 

My own mom is an NMom. I have very limited contact with her. 

Our couples therapist who we have been working with for about 1.5 years asked if my old therapist ever gave me any specific diagnosis and I said no because I wasn’t aware of one. She then said it’s not uncommon for NMom children to have BPD, but she said she wasn’t diagnosing me with BPD or implying I had it. 

She didn’t use the term fleas, but she said I may be imprinting Narc behavior on my FMIL because I have my own work to do that I wasn’t able to resolve with my own parents who she said likely both have a personality disorder. 

I felt like she was saying I may have fleas and it totally brought me down to my knees. I have spent most of last night and this morning crying. Fleas or possible personality disorder are my worst fear so I’ve been feeling really sad and angry that she asked me if my last therapist gave me any sort of diagnosis. Anyone else have this experience? 

Obviously want to get better if I do have fleas and will go to a different community if I do have a personality disorder, but nonetheless has really rocked my world. My partner agrees with couples therapist."
Can anyone else neatly divide their life into phases of “fight” and phases of “flight” with rare to little memory of anything else?,7,mhxu4o,0,"Once I learned about the idea that all coping strategies, good and bad, are simply “fight or flight” type responses to a perceived threat, I immediately realized that I have basically always been existing one way or the other.

For weeks, sometimes months at a time, I am *on my shit.* All responsibilities, self care and goal oriented pursuits are accomplished, and I am telling everyone around me about how everything is different now, and I’m so much better and happier. It’s never felt sustainable, though, it’s always such a hustle and grind that eventually I wonder how on earth anyone could go on like that on a regular basis. 

Fast forward another month, and I am the exact opposite. Any and all addictive/numbing behaviors become overwhelming and all-consuming. Even in the moment, it feels like running and hiding. Negative, cluttered thinking leads to a cluttered living space and I spiral socially, physically and emotionally. Eventually, I hit a “bottom” and elect to overhaul everything, which leads back to the other side. 

Only in rare occasions can I ever remember not existing one way or the other. Am I doomed to be perpetually amygdala-activated? Is there always going to be something to sprint towards or away from?"
Abilify... Manic?,1,mhxrcr,3,"Backstory.

Back in august, I had a trigger with a ptsd rape issue I never addressed 15 yes ago.. I completely split in my head and cut off my feelings with my fiance. Met someone who became my favorite person. 

When they decided to stop talking to me 6 weeks later... I full on went, what I thought, hypomanic.  I was so hypersexual, talking to like 30 guys, taking naked pics, cheating on my fiance who I felt broken up with but he didn't know my feelings changed at all. Cheated on him. 

Now we're working things out and my therapist and psychiatrist think it was all ptsd triggered. I had a hard time regulating my emotions, from happy to blank, sudden rages. 


TLTR
 I'm on abilify now (only 2mg) for about a week and today I suddenly spent 100 dollars on easter toys and stuff for my son. Aka crap toys. 
I want to jump up and down and laugh.. I'm skipping around my house and playing around with my cats... 
I don't hate it but also I feel out of control? 
I told my fiance to keep a look out bc I don't know where it could take me. And I may lose clarity eventually."
Going through a toxic divorce,2,mhxr6e,2,"
How come there’s not much support or literature for a person with bpd who was married to an avoidant and how the process of divorce makes us face a lot of past trauma and strong feelings of being alone? 

Seems everything is oh you’re divorcing a crazy person with bpd 

But what about what a bpd person goes through?"
I have been violent in the past towards my own parents and I still feel bad about it,2,mhxoop,1,Having been to court pretty much convinced me that I can not lay my hands on anyone to deal with my anger. I learned other coping skills that doesn’t involve laying my hands on people.
Can’t talk to wife anymore.,5,mhxi5l,4,"A few months back, she was seeing another man. She says it was never physical, but was obviously emotional. She justified herself as needing to feel taken care of and told me that I’m her black cloud. This is the 3rd time in our 17 year relationship. 

When I asked her what would have happened hadn’t I found out, she said she didn’t know. This is what hurts the most. This may not have been just a fling.

There was a time I could vent/talk with her about my struggle, but that’s dead now. 

I love her, but am deeply hurt by all of this. My struggles have been going on for years, and it’s taken a toll on her. Bankruptcy, job changes and losses. Financial struggle. I get it. Objectively I’m a raging looser and I always will be.  I’d move out, but don’t have the money and I fear that if I don’t have my kids everyday that I’ll end up taking the big sleep. 

I wish I hadn’t found out and had just let the relationship take its course. She’d replace me with w functional model and I could just slink away. Maybe my kids could learn their stepdad. 

Medication and therapy have helped little. I continue with treatment (3 years now), it just doesn’t work. 

On top of that, my everyday life with BPD. I’m utterly exhausted. We have two wonderful kids that I couldn’t leave, but I just want it all to end. The fight has gone on so long that I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. 

The kids keep things civil for us. They’ve never seen me loose my temper and I do not yell. They are why I’m still alive. 

I’m also working on accepting what I am and am giving myself distance from her (internally) so that the kids don’t know. The shame and self hatred are strong. I don’t even like to leave the house out of embarrassment. All of this doesn’t come from just my wife, there’s plenty of other shit. This one put my abandonment issues on top. One more scar to carry. 

I’ve purposely smashed my hand (bruising only), cut myself, dropped weights on my foot, purposely rolled my ankle, and tried to throw myself down our stairs twice. 

I didn’t make it very far on the steps and only ended up with bruises. Failed again. Story of my fucking life. 

If you’ve read this, I’m sorry to bring you down. It’s funny, nothings changed but writing this felt good. Seems to help me make peace with what I am."
Therapist Canceled on the Anniversary of a Tarumatic Event,3,mhwppp,6,"Edit to title: Traumatic Event**

SOME INFO ON BPD THAT YOU FEEL DOES NOT GET TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH,1,mhwnj1,5,"Hello all, I’m currently seeing a therapist but I feel as if my depression and anxiety are not the only factors I’m dealing with mentally. Can you please share moments of when you realized you might be suffering from something else other than just depression/anxiety? Also, if anyone wants to give some insight on BPD that they feel isn’t talked about enough, please share. I’m looking for as much information as I can get.

FP,7,mhwh6c,2,"so i’m currently speaking to someone and have been for a little while now, he’s so lovely and super supportive and caring, i don’t think it’s going to go anywhere properly though because of certain circumstances but i’ve accepted that i think 😅

i’m just wondering if anyone knows any ways to kind of ‘slow down’ my feelings towards him since with bpd your feelings can get so intense n you can really get your hopes up etc, i just want to be able to feel these feelings i have towards him but.. normally?? without it being so ‘obsessive’ if that makes any sense, any help would be massively appreciated, thank you!!"
Human interaction feels like taking a drug,74,mhvwa1,11,"This might sound insane, but since i've started isolating myself I feel like I have had legitimate withdrawal symptoms to not talking to my fp and other friends. I reflect and see that I was on constant highs and lows, no middle ground, either ecstatic to be talking to them or depressed from overthinking the interaction. Those little bursts of happiness feel like I'm taking some drug that makes me crash just minutes later but the high is too good to stop. I felt addicted and couldn't stop myself even though I was in pain.

Now that I'm isolated it's so boring, but I'm content. And it hurts so bad. It hurts realizing that all my pain is really caused by talking to friends because of the overthinking and reactions I have. I have no middle ground, I have to completely take myself out of the picture to be content. It's so lonely, and it hurts being so lonely, and I'm constantly fighting whether I should go back because I miss them or stay away because I'm more mindful and at peace like this."
It’s okay to eat a lot of chocolate at easter,16,mhvuzs,2,"Just a post to any of my fellow binge eaters out there who have multiple eggs/bits of chocolate and feel like they’re going to binge eat all of them in one night (I just demolished the majority of a Lindt bunny).

Idk why it’s so hard to communicate with people. I work at a vet hospital and I’m still training and when I ask questions I feel like people just have no idea what I’m actually trying to say ??? 

Like they’ll answer me with something that had nothing to do with my question.. and Im just left like confused ??? Like do i not speak the same language? Wtf man??? I thought I was just dumb but now I’m like is it a bpd thing? Do I not form proper sentences? What is going on? 

I always feel like talked down to cause people think my question is dumb but it’s like???? That wasn’t even why I was asking... just feels super frustrating and i almost feel attacked cause I’m like did you even try to listen to what I was saying or did you just assume I’m an idiot? Blah"
"Everything just feels ""different""",28,mhvg45,11,"It's very hard to describe so... Idk, I sometimes just wake up (not that often, like every 1/4 year or something) and everything just feels slightly different... My whole surroundings, the time... Like a ""new age"" just started or something. I know that nothing changed physically but for example my room just doesn't feel like ""my room"" anymore.... I know it's still my room, but it suddenly doesn't give me this sense of safety anymore - atleast not as much as it used to do because it just feels different. Does anyone else know this feeling? Because rn I feel like I'm just insane :/"
Dbt,5,mhva8n,3,"I am super lucky to have gotten to be apart of a DBT program so quickly. But I’m almost halfway through it and I feel like I have been doing bad at it. Like I’m not using the skills enough, and I am not the best at doing the homework. And I know you really need to focus on it, it’s just so hard because everything and anything is overwhelming.. idk. Has anyone else felt this way ? I’m in dbt but I feel hopeless and like I haven’t paid enough attention to practicing it and now I’m worried I’ve fucked up"
DAE ever sometimes feel generally uncomfortable with themselves?,82,mhv4ek,8,"When I say uncomfortable I mean just an intense uneasy feeling with yourself, your life, your bad habits, etc. I get into these moods where I feel down on myself and am very self critical. I start obsessively thinking about all the mistakes or awkward moments from over the years that randomly pop into my mind here and there, start feeling like people hate me or are judging me much like I judge myself. And then I kinda want to disappear"
How do I accept being single for so long with no FP and no one who loves me romantically?,8,mhuyrr,4,"
Hey guys. I’ve been struggling lately with a lot of anxiety about my being single. I just can’t stand it anymore. I’m in therapy and I have put a lot of things in place to ward off loneliness and increase my self worth, but I just can’t stand being lonely and alone and single. 

Among the things I do to structure my days are:
- going for a walk
- listening to podcasts 
- reading books
- spending time with my dog 
- taking in the sun
- seeing friends
- started painting 

But I have been single for close to 3 (!!) years and it’s getting to me. I have never even had a hookup since then.

I’ve been on a lot of dates but it never works out. I’m tired of being the only single person in my group of friends. I’m tired of waking up with no one special texting me. I’m tired of the endless matches on tinder where people never reply to me.

Every time I get a match and they don’t reply to me it triggers me into obsessive episodes where I’m self destructive and I end up crying and engaging in suicidal ideation. But I CANT STAND THIS LONELINESS so I never delete the dating apps. Because ultimately the illusion that I might meet someone some day is stronger and more comfortable and reassuring. 
I just want to love someone and be loved back, to be touched, to be intimate with someone, to matter to someone.

Sometimes I want to kill myself because I feel so alone and because it seems so bleak and like no one will ever love me because why would they? Since I’m a big piece of shit 

How do I accept that I might never find anyone special? How do I accept that I might never be someone’s special person?"
Brother just got diagnosed - how do i treat you guys best so we can have a non-toxic relationship?,6,mhuybl,4,"i’ve looked at a lot of support forums (i accidentally stumbled upon, you know which one, “for bpd relatives” thinking it was a support group) but they seem to demonize y’all and treat y’all like monsters. both that and the new diagnosis really effed with my mind in the last couple of days  - it both answered so many unsolved conflicts (like i always blamed myself and was confused for how he treated me when splitting), but it also really confused me in terms of how to treat my brother. 

i am currently his favorite person. we get along very well as for now. but i know it won’t last forever and i’m emotionally prepared for when he will eventually split and abuse me for a period of time before he switches back. 

the abusive periods are really difficult to put up with but the best thing i can do is avoid him as much as possible. 

he got diagnosed but refuses treatment for now.

i heard a lot of conflicting advice as to how to treat borderlines. from cutting ties to controlled affection, i’m just confused now so i want to ask you guys who have it. 

how do we non-bpd treat you? how do we treat you when we are the FP? how do we treat you when you split on us? should i accept the love he gives me now or should i keep things semi-distant? 

are there things that make it worse? 

i love my brother and i don’t want to demonize or shun him but i also don’t want to enable him if that’s what i’m doing."
My bf asked for lewds for weeks and when I sent them ignored me,2,mhu8rz,8,"He's been asking for weeks for lewds so I sent them and he just completely ignored them

I don't ever send him photos of myself because he doesn't ever compliment them he rarely tells me im beautiful or anything like that he doesn't do words of affirmation but sometimes my bpd brain needs them to feel secure

But then if I ask him for reassurance he gets annoyed because I should know how he feels based on his actions"
I can’t handle being around people because I feel worthless,1,mhu0ep,3,"I’m not sure what I will title this

I’m just feeling intense pain and I’m wondering if anybody else here feels this way.

I have feelings of intense dislike and self loathing. I don’t like almost anything about myself, and hide myself away because if I see anybody who looks prettier than me, I feel so much pain.

I see the way that they are happy. People at the same age who are able to keep friends and to live a normal life. I feel like an empty shell, unable to feel or do the things that I want to. 

In those moments where I can’t hide myself away, I realise why I had to drop out of school and employment when my feelings of self loathing were triggered. When I would avoid and run from it, but even being in a public space I can’t.

It hurts being this way. I acknowledge my feelings and reassure myself who I am and why my appearance is different from others and that I am still loveable and have worth, even if I might not see it right now. 
But it comes crashing down when I realise that I’m a dislikable person and I feel helplessness and despair that I have to face these problems.

I know in part a lot of this is imaginary and even if things were going on, I still deserve to love my life and have positive self image.

I can’t find it in me to feel okay with myself, to not feel negative about everything in my life. 
I’m feeling so worthless that words can’t even describe it."
WE CLEAN 30 DAYS OUT HERE 🎉,49,mhtgaq,2,"Trigger warning ⚠️ self harm and suicidal ideation. 

Literally forever, if I felt even a flicker of emotion that was anything but numb I’d think of what I could use to self harm. Anything more than a minor inconvenience to some, had me spiraling out and thinking of ways to end my life. 
After some real intense reflection and a journey I had to walk alone, I haven’t self harmed for the entire month of March. And surprisingly- when I get angry now I can remember to breathe. Healing is tricky and things got messy, I had to take it hour by hour at some points - but I’m here. I’m breathing, even if I really didn’t want to be. 
I really wish I had people irl to share this with but honestly I just want to tell someone.
Have a good day fam."
Sooooo I finally got through my emotional wall of protection and asked someone out,5,mht9w0,1,"TW: unrequited feelings, CSA, dissociation 

I really trust them and find them to be an incredible person, we’ve been friends for about 7 months and I could never tell whether they were super encouraging or had a thing for me.

So after hyping myself up for a while and working through some trauma, I finally asked them out. They asked whether our mutual friend could come along, instead of looking like a possessive fool and exclaiming “no! I want to go on a date with you!” and outing myself like that I just said okay. I had a crush on both of them but wasn’t feeling particularly ‘possessive’ or betting on either turning into something. 

Sooo now they’re both together and although I’m happy for them, I’m sad that I put myself out there and these are people I really love, so I can’t hide my shame and just ghost the whole friend group like I usually would. Icing on the cake? The night I found out they were together I had friends over for dinner and most stayed the night (necessary disclaimer - there is no Covid vases actively in my area) and in the morning I came out to them asleep, smiling in each other’s arms. 

And nooooow I’m triggered back to early teenhood of unrequited loves and feeling like a predator that stem from abuse as a child. I just want some goddamn intimacy and this was a person I finally felt like I could feel safe with and be honest to, my last 10 or so years of sexual experience ends with me dissociating and blacking out. I just want the option to have a normal sex/love life already

Obviously I’ve over shared but context felt needed haha"
A Mum with BPD ; an introduction,7,mhsywk,6,"First time poster on here,long time user..this is also gonna be random shit that comes into my brain...I need an outlet..

I''m 26,I have a 5yo daughter,and Borderline Personality Disorder has made me a better person.


I was officially diagnosed with BPD at 17. I had my daughter at 20. I had my first ""adult"" manic breakdown when I was 22. 

Some days are miserable,where I wish I could really drive into the telephone pole instead of fantasizing over it. Some days are incredible and I'm thankful I'm alive and feel I have a larger purpose in thioutlet. But everyday,my inner monologs are loud and obnoxious. 


I explain it like this : Imagine your mind as a village. One that you've created from the rubble,one that you've put you're everything and all into..
Now you're on a shore line and you see the water receding,then you look to the horizon and notice the tsunami is growing larger but you can't do anything but watch it gain power. Then within the blink of an eye,the tsunami crashes your village,destroying everything within it's path. That's BPD episodes.  The waves are my bouts of depression,happiness,and anger throughout the day. I roll with those usually well,sometimes I'm caught in the current and choke on some water but most days I can tread and go with the motions. Sometimes,I feel I have to lock the village idiot up or it's going to say ignorant things. Sometimes,the village elder shows her face with her wisdom and poise. 


Cannabis and DBT/Marcia Linehan have saved my life. I'm not a zombie on SSRIs anymore. I can regulate my emotions better. Becoming a mother has given me purpose. Having a meaningful career has given me purpose. Having larger goals and ambitions have helped. But I wouldn't be who I am without BPD. And I'm thankful for that,even when I wish I was ""normal"".


Thanks for letting me rant

How can I stop obsessing over my FP?,1,mhsmzc,2,"Has anyone ever successfully switched their favorite person on purpose? Like I know its probably impossible to not have one at all, but I just wish I wasn't so attached to my current FP. For multiple reasons he is not always available and it really screws with my moods. How can I get over this?"
Not sure on how to cope with my husband joining the military soon.,1,mhshl3,3,"We never agreed on this. The military has always been something he wanted to experience. I sparked multiple explosive fights over the years, but as I began realizing how selfish I was being, I had let go a bit. I’m still not okay with his decision, and I’m scared shitless. But still, I want him to regret nothing when he’s old.

A little background, we made 13 years in 2020, and finally tied the knot January of this year. He began being more and more proactive in his journey in joining the military, and now we’re just waiting on his ship date. 

For a while, I kept putting it in the back of my mind to cope and be able to function in my daily activities, but as the time gets closer, I feel a void in my chest. And my stomach drops at the thought of dropping him off when he needs to leave for basic.

I’m now entering into a depressive state of mind. A mild, but steadily growing depression. I feel it because I find it harder to wake up in the morning, fall asleep at night, do any school work, focus, and I’m always tired... this is how my body reacts to depression and anxiety.

I recently started seeing a new therapist, and she wants me to find friends and hobbies to occupy my time, but I really can’t function without my husband. My husband is my best friend. He’s pretty much my only friend. Other people exhaust me. As shitty as that sounds of me, it’s the whole truth. I really, really fucking can’t. It’s not even a choice at this point. I’m genuinely scared of what the state of my mental health is going to be like once he’s gone. We haven’t slept away from each other in almost 7 years."
Insomnia’s a bitch,7,mhs2sd,0,"Does anyone else get hit with random bouts of insomnia? It is one of the things that can undo all my hard work over the course of one night and on top of feeling like I have brain damage from the lack of rest, it makes me really angry whenever I’m struck by it. I never know the direct cause other than I can’t turn my fucking brain off even when my body is tired or I can’t stop moving even though my brain is dead."
Feeling very emotionally detached right now,3,mhrbxv,2,"Specifically around suicide and valuing my own life. There are so many other people in the world that could easily fill any of the roles I play in other peoples' lives. Why should it matter if it's specifically me that's around? Why are people so opposed to me killing myself? Why can't I just be euthanized?

When I ask these questions at the moment I feel very matter of fact. Very emotionless towards it all and not at all distressed or anything. It's so different from my usual wild mood swings, but also welcome. 

I know that if someone close to me were to die, from suicide or otherwise, that I'd feel very strongly about the situation. But right now I can't imagine why someone would feel the same for me. It almost seems silly? I'm very replaceable.

Idk. Felt like sharing and am curious if anyone else gets these thoughts."
NSFW: How can I possibly move on?,8,mhq5av,10,"Hi, I'm new here and I'm broken.
I just ruined my long term relationship with the love of my life because of this condition. The paranoia ruined things. I can't cope with the thoughts and the pain from it. It hurts more than anything I've ever experienced. I'm not new to love, he was just special.
I have agoraphobia and M.E/CFS also. I am restricted to the house because of my anxieties. What future can I possibly have? I'm supposed to be getting DBT but June is the earliest. I think I'm too far gone though. I'm just a burden.
Please don't worry about me. I am safe at the moment. I'm just so lost."
Life on a roller coaster is getting to me,7,mhplzn,1,"I still haven’t accepted the full scale of impact that this has on me day-to-day. Because I minimize it, it finds new ways to affect me.  

In some ways I’m doing well right now. I can keep my emotions better controlled than I used to, which is nice. I have not self harmed in a while despite the impulse. I’m proud of myself for both these things and should probably give myself more credit. 

Other stuff I’m not handling as well. I’m not splitting when it comes to *other people,* which is good, but I’m splitting when it comes to myself and almost everything else. My paranoia has been bad. Particularly about my job. Last week I felt like I was on the verge of getting promoted. This week I’m convinced that I’m the weak link on staff. 

I just wish I could have control of my own worldview. That I didn’t have to live every day at the will of extremes. No wonder why I’m always  exhausted. 

I don’t talk openly about how my BPD makes me feel... ever... but it’s weighing on me tonight and I needed to put the words out there. Hopefully it’s a state of mind I can sleep off by morning."
I am fucked. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,103,mhpln0,12,"One second my loneliness is killing me. The next second, I wanna run away from a few people I have because it's too much. 

I love someone to death. And boom, Idgaf if they got killed. 

I think I am asexual. Then I am into BDSM. 

I am oblivious as fuck. Also, I am the master of sarcasm. 

I panic when I stand near a girl. Then I flirt with them. 

I wanna kill myself. Then I give a speech to the audience in my head about my 80yr life. 

I cry over getting fewer fries. And I laughed seeing my fav aunt's dead body. 

I'm always in flight or fight mode. If not I am almost dead and can't get out of bed. 

I crave for love. And when someone wants to be with me, I run away. 

No one understands me, including me. 

I just want this to fucking stop. I want to be normal for at least a day. This sucks. BPD fucked my life."
DAE have any vices the use to cope with the suffering?,2,mhpkk5,1,"As we all know this disorder is a pain in the ass to deal with everyday. Try as I might to apply the healthy life skills to cope with this awful disorder when my symptoms get severe I resort to my unhealthy vices. 

Does anyone else resort to unhealthy vices in the midst of suffering?"
am i overreacting for wanting to break up with my boyfriend cause hes a bad texter,3,mhpfch,3,"I’ve (19F )been with my boyfriend (21M) for about 9 months now and Im getting so frustrated to the point where i just want to end things with him. 

On almost a daily basis i will text him and he takes like hours to respond and i get it if youre busy or got distracted its fine that happens to everyone but this happens almost every fucking day and on top of that while my texts go unnoticed ill see him on instagram and twitter too. Ive talked to him about this multiple times and he says its cause hes not on his phone that much, gets busy, his adhd etc and thats fair not everyone is a good texter or likes texting but when were together every 5 minutes or when theres a moment of silence he goes straight to his phone. hes always on his phone when we hang out and he doesnt make an effort to start conversation with me unless i initiate it. sometimes he’ll ask me how im feeling or he will just ask if im horny and want to have sex. Its annoying because im always asking what he wants to do, or initiating a conversation, finding something to watch. I also told him like if texting isnt your thing we can call each other during the week and stuff. and of course im the only one who calls/offers to call. Like it hurts because it feels like he doesnt give a shit when were together and when were apart 

im so fucking annoyed because ive brought this up to him a few times before and its making me angry cause i dont wanna constantly nag about this i feel like i should just leave the relationship because it makes me so upset. 

i try to look at the positives of our relationship and i do love him but im starting to realize he does the bare minimum and im tired of asking him to put in more effort. 

maybe im overreacting and being too harsh especially since he has his own issues and its common for ppl with adhd to have poor communication skills but holy fuck i bave adhd too on top of my bpd and ive been trying so hard with this relationship to properly communicate my feelings and not blow up on him and work on my toxic shit and ive been doing good. 

But i also dont want to keep having the same conversation with him and there be no change. I dont want to be in a one sided relationship. 

has anyone else been in a similar situation and can give me advice on what to do i feel so stuck and irrational"
Maybe our bad reputation is turning around.,26,mhoyxi,1,"After having some of the absolute worst episodes over the last week wherein I nearly lost both my nonBPD bf AND my job, I decided it was time to start getting serious about getting help and starting DBT. My GP has been unaware of my diagnosis for years now, and has never given up trying to help my suffering any way she could. I reluctantly told her today hoping the horror stories of judgement wouldn’t apply.

She responded FANTASTICALLY! She seemed relieved to finally have a diagnosis that not only made sense, but could now be treated (She suggested DBT). Additionally, she requested FMLA paperwork from my employer to set me up with a 3 week leave for intensive therapy, 4 days per month I can have for therapy sessions or mental health days, and 1/2 days anytime I have an episode. 

I was blown away. It’s such an incredible feeling to have the support you need. She renewed my faith that I will someday control my illness instead of it controlling  me."
I just got diagnosed with BPD,5,mhouct,2,"An hour ago I got diagnosed with BPD, I don’t know how to feel about it. My friends are supportive, my family are treating it like I’m possessed or smth, as if they talk about it, they’ll get it too. I know BPD is really taboo and stigmatised so I’m worried what others will think."
no grasp of reality and anhedonia,19,mhor35,2,"anyone else feel absolutely nothing? i mean besides emotions related to splitting, i dont feel anything at all. like my first priority in life is attention and feeling loved, everything else doesn't matter to me. i want to care about things like school and my future but i simply don't. there isn't any place in life where i don't feel totally stressed out or nothing at all. nothing creative is satisfying, physical activity is boring. the only thing that provides me any sort of relief are things like sex, food and self harm. i've lost any true interest in improving on any skills or hobbies. it all seems just. not even pointless?? but i don't care enough to try. i dont even mean this in a nihilistic sense but in my mind i genuinely feel like nothing is real and nothing matters to me."
"does anyone else ""fantasize"" about traumatic events?",635,mhob70,70,"I often feel like my life hasn't been bad enough to justify having symptoms like this, and when this happens I end up deep in these dark fantasies of horrible things happening to me or people I know with emphasis on their traumatic effect on me. I think this is some sort of desire for people to understand what I'm going through and earn more social permission to be mentally ill.

does anyone else experience this or even have tips for dealing with this?"
How do you experience black and white thinking?,10,mhoar8,7,"Hi everyone. I am 19 years old and my therapist and I recently discussed that I show many traits of BPD (more than the “required” amount of symptoms to be diagnosed) though she is hesitant to officially diagnose due to the stigma with personality disorders. However, for the “black and white thinking” trait, I asked her for more clarification and she told me she did not know an answer. So, I figured it would be better to ask others that actually experience this, as that is what my question(s) pertain to. I definitely switch between idolizing and demonizing people mentally, though I was wondering if it mattered if this switch between the two was caused by something or if it was somewhat random. For me, it seems to either be random, or they will do something (that is objectively not a very big deal and does not warrant it) and I will assume that they hate me, they’re trying to use me, they’re out to get me, they want to leave me, etc. I just wanted to hear some thoughts on this. Thanks everyone."
It would be easier if I was single,2,mho3js,11,"My life would be so much easier if my husband just left me. I work so hard to be normal and he doesn’t get it. One wrong tone of voice and he treats me like I haven’t improved at all. 

Leaving him would make my life so much easier. My life would suck and I would be incredibly lonely but it would be so so so much easier."
DAE not realize how weird their behavior is until afterwards?,78,mho326,2,"Like I’ll do some really weird shit because I’m so caught up in my emotions. Like not even mean or hurtful, just peculiar and awkward or coming off as clingy. It’s just hard because when I am feeling better I have to deal with the consequences of shit I did when I was not regulating my emotions well. So it’s hard to move forward and feel good about myself and my relationships after I do weird stuff. My instinct is to pretend it didn’t happen but that doesn’t actually work well."
My girlfriend has BPD and nothing is getting better,3,mho28l,16,"We are long distance, she has had it for a long time, I do not have BPD however I have to suffer the effects of it through her. She goes to a therapist but does not receive treatment, she doesn't tell her therapist anything and I am the only person that knows all the full facts, however, she won't sign a release form for me to talk to her. I try to help, really, it's hard to put up with though, I'm autistic and when she's in an episode she tells me I'm retarded and uses stuff against me, threatens to cheat again, the BPD is a monster, she is lovely, but I don't speak to her often, mostly just the BPD now... I have 1000 questions and honestly my mind is so muddled after everything she's put me through over the past 6 or so months that I can't even put together a coherent question, I'll probably post again when I think of one. She is ""bored"" of dating me, but I know she can't handle life without me, she has devalued me already and now I am ""all bad"", yet she still craves my attention, she tells me I've done something wrong and will start screaming, but when I ask what, she can't even give a reason. This will not get better without treatment, but she will not get treated correctly without the therapist knowing everything, but without the release form being signed, I can't tell her anything... I don't see a way out until I am with her in person and can physically prove that things are ok, as she is very receptive to physical affection. There is no point to this post, I don't think at least, I don't really know what I'm thinking or feeling to be fair, this has fucked with me to the extreme. I just need a way out, not of the relationship, out of what it has become, a way back to the past, the old her, I love her and I know she makes me happy, I've been with her for nearly 2 years now, but I hate the BPD, I'm staying for no other reason than I'm holding out hope that the real her will be back one day. Until then, all I can do is wait and suffer through it all..."
Wish I could be someone,6,mho0lg,0,"I just wish I could be someone instead of being everyone and no one. Is any1 else barely able to keep it together? i want to end it so badly. how do you guys cope? I find nothing interesting anymore, if I do it’s very shallow and temporary. No one to talk to anymore because everyone left me, even people I thought were like me and  would be with me forever. I’m sick of the struggling, I tried so hard."
Never enough. Not for me. Not for anyone.,7,mhnz7y,3,"I don't feel like it will ever be. If it is, it will take every part of my being to do so. I tried to reach out and to be understood and as many times as I've tried to explain and simplify it. It isn't enough. I won't ever have real friends. I won't ever be able to feel I'm fully embodied. The best I can hope for is that atleast I understand others. I understand them, I help them, and I am their catalyst for their growth. Is anyone my catalyst? Is anyone my friend? Nah. .

I know well enough I'm only here to be here for others. I'm main character or anyone important. I exist for others. I am unknown and alone. I'm only some weird foundation for others to build their empire or self on. I wasn't meant to be cared for or acknowledged."
problems with obsessing over anyone who shows me any kind of affection.,32,mhnq2a,3,I was recently diagnosed and i’ve found this is a common problem which is kind of good to hear? but i just got out of a “fwb” relationship with a coworker and she recently cut me off and told me not to text her outside of work because she is having mental health problems. any ways you guys get over this feeling? obsessing over an unavailable person?
Should people with BPD avoid relationships with other people who have mental health issues?,2,mhnouv,7,"Does anyone have an opinion about whether it's best for a person with BPD to date so-called ""normal"" people instead of other folks with mental health conditions? I've started talking to someone on an app and we've been bonding over our shared experiences with mental health, which has been really refreshing. But at the same time, I'm wondering if it's a bad idea to combine two people who have problems? I just tend to find that ""normal"" people are more judgmental and less understanding of what I deal with. What have been your guys' experiences with dating other people with conditions? Do you think it makes for less healthy relationships, or do you feel more understood?"
My fp absolutely hates me :((,1,mhnn0n,1,"I don’t know how long this will be I’m typing on a whim but my favorite person genuinely despises me. Recently I found out through another friend via screenshots that he’s talked so mych trash about me such as calling me super annoying, saying I’m a literal snowflake and way too sensitive, disliking me, etc. I’ve had so many anxiety attacks over the past days about it and I don’t know what to do. I love him romantically too and I still do, I’m just so distraught over this and feel so empty it’s so much to process and I still want to talk to him about it I don’t even know what to do :((. I’m also a minor with bpd if that helps anything 😭 I really do love him so much and it’s not even his fault and he’s also lied to me on so many occasions and manipulated me too. I thought his feelings towards me were genuine but it was all a massive manipulation scheme. He’s also called me manipulative too when I never had inteneded to manipulate him, in fact I’ve said a countless amount of times that I had this huge fear of coming off as manipulative and all. I’m just so tired I can’t even sleep because I’m so fucking anxious I just wish to speak to him once again because he blocked me :(( I think I deserve it because I had blocked him about four times before cause I got so so angry over the smallest things and was trying so hard not to lash out even though he said it was “fine.”"
When should I tell the new guy I’m dating about my BPD?,7,mhnk3a,7,"  I was recently diagnosed last year with BPD. It has definitely been the root of many of my issues with my past relationships. I feel more at peace being able to assign a name and reason as to why I have acted the way I have to my partners in the past.
  
  I just got out of a seven year relationship about four months ago and am ready to get back on to the so-called dating horse. Since I’ve been in a relationship for so long and because of my new diagnoses, getting to know and dating people does not come naturally for me. 

  Fortunately, I managed to meet this amazing guy from Tinder. It’s only been a few weeks but he definitely seems stable with a great family. He’s incredibly open minded and honest (borderlining an over-sharer, but I kind of like that as I can be the same way). I have a lot of respect for him and I really want this relationship to be stable and last a while. I want to be honest with him about my BPD but I’m unsure when a good time is or how long I should wait to tell him.

What do I do to stop spending so much money,1,mhmxyb,2,I don’t understand why I can’t buy just the necessary things I always say I’ll stop spending money and that this will be the “last time I’ll be shopping” and that I’ll stop spending but I just don’t :(
"BPD in a foreign county, not knowing language",3,mhmbtj,0,"For a long time I’ve felt very alone in this. Although I am not keen to labels, there is a sense of comfort in knowing that a diagnosis exists and that many people experience it. I’ve made many giant steps and I don’t commend myself much for doing so, obviously. I moved to a different country for someone and although everyone speaks English fluently there are moments where people will switch to their language right in front of me and it makes me want to crawl out of my skin. My boyfriend tries really hard to accommodate, but there are many times where that is not the case. I feel like it’s a BPD individuals nightmare. You can’t help but feel left out and you’re left with intense feelings of shame, and it’s hard to bounce back especially when you’re in a social setting. It makes me scared for the next party that happens. Almost everyone here speaks English fluently, but they often choose to speak in their own language. I get stuck in this loop of feeling like “yeah that’s pretty inconsiderate” to “no I’m just a loser and I  just need to accept it.” It’s a confusing feeling and I don’t want to feel this intensely about it. Help?"
A bad therapist is worse than no therapist. It isn't your fault.,175,mhlvfc,13,"I don't know who needs to hear this.  Last year, when I hit rock bottom, I came here and I had a bad experience with a user when I made the above statement.  I couldn't articulate my reasoning at the time.  I just knew that what I said was right, but I was told that what I said was one of the worst things a pwBPD can hear, and that my saying that prevented someone from getting help.  The individual then invaded my DMs after I deleted my post, and mocked me and laughed at me and called me a piece of shit.

I reported them and it was actioned, but the experience sent me into a spiral of guilt, self pity, depression, and all that fun stuff that comes from this oh so lovely disorder that I'm sure we're all well-versed in.

A year out from that experience, and a lot of self-reflection, and healing, (and learning I was raised by acutely narcissistic parents, and that them abusing me in fact WASN'T my fault), here is what I want to say and I really hope it helps someone out there like me, who went through years of therapy, but found it actually made things worse:

\----

I am of the belief BPD is a direct cause of one's environment (abuse), and also believe it is 100% treatable because of this, if one is able to completely remove themselves from the toxic influence and work on themselves and identify their own toxic behavior.  

It is rare for a person with a healthy upbringing to exhibit cluster B personality traits, so going to a therapist who is not well-versed in narcissistic and invalidating families is going to make you feel like YOU'RE the one causing all the problems.  They will look at the symptoms but not the cause.  They will prescribe meds, try to give you coping 'mindfulness' tips, and tell you why all of your outbursts against your family were inappropriate.  

These are tips that one can use to function in a healthy environment.  When you're in a narcissistic environment, you can try all the mindfulness, meds, and CBT/DBT you want, it won't stop them from abusing you and making you hate yourself.  And because narcissists are so good at projecting a good face to the world, your therapist might even take their side, since you're already been deemed as the 'crazy one' who had to get therapy.  

As long as you are under their influence, no amount of therapy is going to make you feel better.  They WANT you to feel bad so they have control over you, and can feel superior that YOU'RE the one in therapy, and not them.

I remember sitting in countless different therapists' offices, telling them all the horrific abuse my parents did, they would just nod, and write me a prescription for anti-depressants.  They would just assume everything was my depression making everything seem worse than it was.  And I never got better, for decades.  I continued to take abuse, thinking I deserved it, because I convinced myself I was a piece of garbage.  I knew I wasn't a healthy person and I knew I acted poorly in relationships, but I never understood beyond that.

A therapist who doesn't know what narcissistic abuse is like will not connect the dots and understand the source of the problems.  If ANYONE was raised in a narcissistic environment, they would develop signs of a personality disorder as well, just to cope with the constant abuse and neglect that a child has no other way to deal with.

You can finally turn off that auto-play 24/7 recording in your head reminding you that you're a piece of shit.  You can stop feeling bad when you feel like talking to your therapist is like talking to a wall.  BPD is a complicated lock, and you have to find a very specific key tailor made to it in order to get better.

Keep working on yourself.  There is no shame in being abused.  Identify your toxic behaviors, remove abusers, and learn to be ok with yourself and do whatever you can to turn off that auto-recording of your parents/family telling you that you're not good enough."
Any advice on having to live with your toxic parents?,5,mhlrx1,2,"Hi borderline friends :)

With the nature of the pandemic, I am still paying for and actively attending college (virtually and thousands of miles away lol) totally out of a job, broke and living with my parents. These people who “raised” me are making me crazy and I hate living here. My dad is verbally aggressive and quite honestly, getting to be just a grumpy old man. My mom, who has never been the type to create or keep boundaries, is a borderline narcissist and uses me for emotional support, or at least tries to. 

Considering the fact that I think I’ll need about another year to get back on my feet, does anyone have any tips on trying to heal in the environment where you were traumatized? Is that even possible? Any ideas for how to put up firm boundaries and self-preserve as much as I can? Thanks for any suggestions/advice! <333"
Treating Self-Injury through Research Study,5,mhlonx,1,"Thank you to the moderators of r/BPD for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

help. i’m scared to get diagnosed!,2,mhlkcc,5,"hello... i am an 18 ur old cis-gendered bisexual black female. yes. there’s a lot to unpack there. where do i start lol. i think i have BPD but i rly don’t want to self diagnose. i don’t want to go to the GP because i called them the other day and they sounded so patronising and i don’t think that the UK is the best with meds and treatment for mental illness and stuff. i also would just like a professional opinion so i can show my boyfriend. i would like him to believe that what i’m saying is important, and i don’t want this to ruin our relationship. 
let me just list my symptoms :

intrusive thoughts - sexualising everything. thinking about women in a disgusting way, sexualising children or infants. hurting people etc. ( these thoughts gross me out and i would never act on them but i can’t get the out of my head )
impulsive - as soon as i think... i do. 
really REALLY bad self esteem one day and then a GOD like complex the next
i can’t reside whether i’m a lesbian or bisexual like everyday i struggle - this is the biggest bullet point in my opinion. i’m in a long (and happy) heterosexual relationship BUT i have never been with a woman. so the list and attraction to all females is HUGE. this consumes my everyday thoughts. 
constantly try to break up with sig. other 
constantly feel like i need to change myself 
fear of abandonment - i hate knowing that i will be alone. i have to plan what i’m going to o on my ‘alone day’ and keep myself entertained 
suicidal thoughts
i used to self harm but it caused a lot of problems at home and people noticed at school so i stopped. 
drug misuse 
reckless driving 

some events that may have fucked me up mentally: 
- raped at 13 by a 21 year old that went to prison for murder not long after 
- introduced to sexual intimacy at a young age (5yrs) 
- had nudes sent everywhere 
- trapped in an abusive relationship with someone much older than me at 15 
- started using drugs at 13"

my bpd made me an abuser & he gave me so many chances to change. i was blind & didn’t. now he’s gone & i want to be too.,5,mhl3z0,2,"title says it all i guess. for 2 & 3/4 years i was undiagnosed but we knew something was wrong with me. he kept forgiving my manipulative and abusive behaviours. then 4 months ago i was diagnosed, things seemed to make sense. it didn’t fix things, but it made sense. i began to seek the help i needed. it didn’t work right away and i still fell into my old behaviours. he finally left me after an explosion one night. at first i thought we could work it through again, but now it’s been weeks. i’ve been hospitalized & i can’t do anything with myself. i can’t live without him. my fear of abandonment has finally come true. i can’t do this anymore. i can’t sleep in my own bed. when i sleep i have nightmares, and when i wake i cry because i’m living this pain. i can’t do this anymore."
Don’t you wish you didn’t cut out your loved ones?,1,mhl1oz,1,Hey everyone how are you doing today? Don’t you wish you didn’t cut out your loved ones? The reason why I asked this bc my love bc cut me out of her life
Does anyone else get a movie type thing play out in your head when you think/are told a bad situation/scenario MIGHT happen?,3,mhkyk2,2,"Like whenever I get told something bad might happen or I get bad news that 'movie' type thing plays in my head and I act like that's what is 100% going to happen.

For example my boyfriend said he might admit himself to a psych ward and I've been panicking ever since and i get a 'movie' play in my head of him going in, our relationship ending from nonexistent communication, he gets worse etc and then I end up acting like that is exactly what's going to happen
It causes a lot of issues and I'm not sure if it's a bpd thing, a trauma thing etc."
My boyfriend wants to put himself in a mental hospital and I don't know what to do.,1,mhkp3z,0,"My boyfriend (let's call him L) is really struggling with (undiagnosed) OCD. He wants to admit himself to a mental hospital in the town we both live in. The mental hospital in our town is really bad, I had a friend who just about escaped from there and my mums friend who used to work there had to quit because of the way the patients were being treated.

He hasn't even tried one on one therapy, group therapy or any kind of therapy yet even though I've told him he should try that before admitting himself. Hell, he isn't even diagnosed yet (it's clear that he has it and he has all of the symptoms). I've told him he needs to get diagnosed and get therapy but he is insistent on admitting himself even though when he goes in he will lose contact with me, his friends, what healthy coping mechanisms he has left and his pets. I told him locking himself away from everyone and everything he likes isnt going to solve anything, why isnt he going to try getting help outside the mental hospital where he can still do the things he loves and maintain a relationship with me? 

I want what's best for him but I'm feeling so conflicted, my bpd is really bad at the moment and I feel like I'm being abandoned. He's the first person to know about my bpd, I've only just been diagnosed and now I'm losing him too. It feels like I'm losing everyone I care about and that the others are just trying to find ways to get away from me. I have 'friends' but hes the only one I actually have if you get what I mean. While hes in there he isnt allowed a phone and I'm not going to be able to cope on only being able to see him once a week, if that. Everything is falling apart.

I wish I could help him but once again I have no control over anything and I dont know what to do. He won't listen to me.
Am I selfish for not wanting him to go in, even though I've only heard bad things about mental hospitals?

I don't want him to go in, get worse and not come out for years and I don't want our relationship to end but I also want him to get better."
experience with antidepressants and BPD,7,mhkf8q,9,"ive been struggling with depression on and off since i was a child, but within the past two years i’ve been struggling a lot with managing my symptoms. I barely got diagnosed with BPD last summer and although DBT helped a lot, i can’t remember what its like to be happy anymore. i feel like no matter what i try to change in my life im still filled with sadness and self hate and everything feels so exhausting. I brought this up to my psychiatrist and she told me that i could consider antidepressants if my symptoms got worse. I am starting to think that i will always feel this empty so maybe i should try it. I am just so scared of the effects. one of the main reasons i am avoiding it is because i already struggle with my weight, and my sex drive is really important to me and i heard that it affects these aspects the most. how has antidepressants impact you? should i give it a chance even with my concerns? or should i just push through for now"
"Diagnosed with bipolar and BPD traits, but not full BPD?",3,mhjxk8,4,"I’ve had bpd signs since I was 8 and today was diagnosed with BPD traits, I kinda anticipated this but I’m still upset over it lol. I’m just confused as to how BPD traits is different than BPD? My new psych recognized it pretty quickly but said she didn’t think I had “full” bpd

I also have ADHD and bipolar 2 so that complicates things more. Should I go ahead and buy a DBT workbook or something? Reading about bpd all day has made me realize how toxic I am sometimes and now I’m very self conscious 😭

I personally think I reach the diagnostic criteria but idk. I’m guessing I should learn BPD coping skills and stay on my meds but it’s kind of disheartening that someone noticed this about me so quickly....

And side note: does anyone have tips for managing bipolar 2 and bpd?? I’m on lamictal and ability, but I can’t see a therapist for a few months. I need to get my act together bc rn I’m failing school and need a job but this shit is hard to figure out!! I can barely stick to a job/school for more than a few months bc of my emotions and it’s getting embarrassing :( I’m trying to keep my daily life calm and routine but family and friends set me off. so sick of this"
Has anyone ever had their bpd caused by events in later life instead of childhood?,2,mhjmzs,2,"from what I’ve read, you develop bpd because of events in your childhood.

I had a relatively happy childhood with good parents. I had an instance of being “left behind”, by my sister when she moved away. I was about 5. that’s fed my abandonment but otherwise, I was pretty happy. 

I dated someone from 17 through 19 and they emotionally and verbally abused me daily for those 2 1/2 years. I’m an absolute wreck now. I barely function half the time, honestly. I have the most unstable mood imaginable and I have every symptom of bpd. 

I feel like I am the way I am because of him. 

This is getting long so I’ll cut it here. I know it’s something I should probably ask a doctor but I don’t have one right now, so I’m just interested in you guys’ experiences and opinions."
Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with someone who has NPD traits?,10,mhjjxu,5,"I recently came to the realization that my boyfriend has Narc traits, it's not severe but it is noticeable. He lovebombed me in the beginning of our relationship when he first met me BIG time and has a tendency to react very badly to any criticism. Often times when he messes up and I point it out, he will flip it around on me to make it seem like I am the source of every issue and then I end up crying and apologizing even though he's the one who wronged me. 

With that being said, we actually had a really good, open discussion about this last night. I told him I thought he had these traits and pointed out the similarities. I told him I was not trying to diagnose him but just saying that he for sure has some of these traits and it is an issue he needs to work on. He cried and told me that he always felt like something was wrong, his own need for admiration and validation, he thanked me for bringing it to hisnattention and promised that he would really try to be aware of this and work on it. 

So my question is this: 

Is it possible to have a successful relationship as someone who is BPD with somebody who has narc tendencies? Or is this combination too explosive and bound to fail? 

I really love him and I think the fact that we are both self aware gives us an advantage, but I could really use some outside perspective."
My FP Went No Contact and I'm Drowning. Any Words Of Advice On Mitigating This Unbearable Pain?,3,mhji9j,1,"My FP was also my SO.

If anyone has gone through this and found a way out, or otherwise have any words of advice, please impart it. Thanks in advance!"
I don’t wanna leave my house ever again,21,mhjhij,2,"I love living alone, with my cat. I’d be so happy if I never had to leave again. Only a few select people would come over. I could order groceries and get them delivered. I could sell my car. I’d never have to put on makeup. I could masterbate or meditate or tweeze my pubic hair all day.
Maybe I could work from home.
I could sell all my clothes.
I can’t find a purpose in life
But I really love my bed, and tweezer-man tweezers."
I don’t know,4,mhjbem,7,"I don’t really know what to do. I’m being invited to go to a campfire and drink with some friends and I want to go but there’s something holding me back and I can’t bring myself to go. I don’t know what to do, because I don’t know why I’m afraid to go, I just feel like I’ll regret it for some reason I don’t know why. It hurts.

Like I know that if I don’t go, all I’m gonna do is lay in bed regretting it. But I still can’t fucking do it. Sorry.

Someone please help me"
"DAE pick their lips to the point that they are raw and bleeding? CW: Blood, lip-picking",11,mhj8lx,13,"I know lip-picking is a really common problem, but I was wondering if there is a significant link between BPD and lip-picking or if it's just a habit or a symptom linked to something else.

I've struggled with horrible lip-picking for about 7 years. I just can't help myself. I pick and bite at my lips until they are raw, bleeding profusely, scabbed over and peeling constantly. My fingertips and nails are always covered in blood from just how much I pick my lips. I pick them so badly that blood drips down my chin, covers my whole lips, pools in the corners of my mouth, etc. 

It's getting worse and worse and I'm always embarrassed by how it makes me look and feel really ashamed whenever somebody points out the state of my lips. It's also to the point where my teeth ache all the time because I clench my jaw so hard in order to really rip at the skin on my lips, so now my teeth are sore from the pressure I'm putting on them when I pick my lips. 

It's something I do almost without thinking - I'll be completely checked out staring into nothing but when I come back to myself, I catch myself picking at my lips. It's even to the point where I'm wasting time just sitting and compulsively picking at my lips. I'll be trying to get an assignment done but will spend half an hour picking at my lips unable to force myself myself to start doing something else. 

Is it possible that lip-picking has an association with BPD, or is there a completely different link there? It's a horrible, destructive habit of mine and I wish I could stop but I just can't do it."
Is anybody else helped by venting but find that nobody wants to let them do it?,10,mhikwo,9,"I've had a whole bunch of therapists and was not helped by them or they even made me worse but I find peer support really helpful when somebody will just listen to me during a meltdown and make me feel heard and understood. When I can calm down I can go back to being rational and using strategies and healthy thinking and all that. But that's so damn hard to get. And I'm actively punished for seeking it. I've had a lot of bad experiences where people got mad at me for doing this or just stopped responding to my messages. I've been called self-centered and overly negative. It was traumatizing and it's happened so many times that at this point I'm afraid to engage with people unless I feel well enough to put up a fake, happy facade. When I'm too upset to act like that I just avoid people entirely because I'm so afraid that they'll get mad and reinforce that mental schema that I'm too flawed for anybody to ever like or want to talk to. And it also adds to the mental schema that nobody will ever like me unless I somehow start liking and benefitting from therapists. And that no matter what I do for myself, no matter how much I self educate, no matter how hard I try, no matter how well I get to know myself and what helps me, nobody sees that or cares. Just blanket condemnation because if I don't want to go to therapy then I must be an intellectually disabled toddler that just doesn't care. 

It's gotten so bad that I'll stop talking to a person the second it looks like they might be annoyed. But I've been trying to challenge the above by actually giving people a chance to reject me and believing them when they say it's okay to vent instead of doing it once, freaking out like ""oh god I made a mortal mistake"" and then being too scared to ever talk to that person again. But so far I've been unlucky in that people either find me exhausting or simply aren't responsive and I don't feel heard at all and just get more upset.

I hate the whole culture of ""a therapist or else"" and ""self-help and peer support are worthless and stupid"" and am tired of having ""get yet another therapist"" shoved down my throat. And how people act like I don't know anything about my mind even though I did most of a psychology degree, have had tons of therapy, have read tons of self help books, practice healthy habits every day... it's like they think I'm too stupid to have learned a dang thing. It's like they think I'm too dumb to know what works for me and that without a therapist I don't even know when I need to take a shit.

I hate being put in the same league as people who have absolutely no self-insight, have never done therapy, have never read a self help book, have never tried implementing a strategy, have never tried exercising or eating healthy... and treating me like I'm exactly the same. It's like everything I've done to get better and the improvements I've made are invisible and no one cares. Just because my approach is different. No other reason. I hate it."
being alone,2,mhhvjs,3,"so, yesterday I was having a pretty bad episode, still feeling pretty low, but trying to claw my way back up, anyway, my husband came home for his lunch break and I cried my eyes out for a hour straight, because everything feels so over whelming, I’m working on getting back in to therapy, I don’t have insurance because I don’t have a job, so that makes things extra hard. just was feeling all around lost and like everything is out of control. fast forward to when he gets home from work, (we’ve discussed opening up our relationship to be poly (sorry if not the correct term) before so it’s not out of field) he says “another reason why I want to bring another person into our relationship is so that you always have someone around for you because things seem to be worse when you’re alone and I’m not there to keep your mind off of things” I understand where he is coming from, but I can’t help but feel like he thinks I need a babysitter if that makes sense? I don’t know."

Bpd and soulmates?,2,mhha35,3,"Have you ever met someone and believed they were/are your soulmate? Did you ever get over them? What happened? 
I’ve always been one to fall hard when I get involved with someone BUT I’m always easily able to pull myself back and detach if needed. 
I’ve slept with someone a couple of times and I feel this overwhelming sense of love and caring for them, I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM, I literally can’t get him out of my head and it makes me feel so insane. I’m very intuitive and have a strong feeling that we’re supposed to be together but he’s in a relationship and we aren’t speaking. I feel so crazy.  Anyone have advice or something on this?"
Kicked out of ''friends'',4,mhgkz6,1,"(I never know which flair to post. Sorry for the long rant) Or well I thought they were my friends :) Guess not huh. I wasn't doing my chores on time because I was super depressed and that's why they kicked me out(I was starting to feel better after a bit and was going to start doing them again) I literally went to the emergency room when they announced it so that I wouldn't do anything stupid and in the span of 16 hours they had already found a new roommate, lol.... just fucking hilarious, as if this wasn't planned from the beginning. Needless to say there was a lot of splitting and I hate them but they are also the only people that regularly play video games with me so... yeah I need them right now but they certainly don't need me. The worst part is that the girl(who was the owner of the house) is still trying to be friendly with me and acts as if nothing happened and that this is fine. I just fucking hate how she reacts to my memes. We are not friends. I repeat. WE ARE NOT FRIENDS AND I HATE YOU. I hope I find a new group of people soon but I am also resigned to my own self-destruction. I feel lost and I don't really know what to do. I hope I meet new friends soon, would let me leave those people and finally let go of the past. (Again sorry for long incoherent post, I just have a lot on my mind and I guess typing it out made me feel just a tiny little bit better)"
Did I make the right choice?,5,mhgab1,5,"I woke up crying nonstop. Went to a doctor and I was still crying. I cried in his office for almost an hour, couldn't look at him in the eyes (a regular general medicine doctor, not a psychiatrist). He told me to calm down and gave me a sick leave for today and tomorrow but I plan on working tomorrow to avoid problems at work.

I called my boss explaining the situation, I asked if I could be honest, I said I was depressed because of my birthday and having no family and having my birthday alone and I just started crying hard over the phone and she told me to calm down, that the company cared about me.

I was dead honest on everything, and I hate skipping my job. But I'm up to date on my work and we're having a fuckton of holidays, I could catch up during these days.

Anyways, do you think I did the right thing? I'm no longer crying. I think crying that hard actually helped me let go off some pain. I didn't even say I had depression or anything else, I specifically said I was feeling depressed for X and that it won't happen again."
I've been ghosted and can't handle the pain,2,mhg2ls,6,"So I was speaking to a guy I really like and he said he really likes me. We recently rekindled after a year of not talking. Over a year ago when we were speaking, I really liked him and he liked me, but I kept splitting and blocking him as a result. He would always reach out, but in the end he gave up as I went back to my ex (I didn't know I had bpd at the time).
So I reached out to him recently and we were talking for 2 weeks and saw it each other twice. Both times he said he really likes me and hopefully we get together. He also said he's talking other people, but doesn't want to hurt me so thought he'd let me know. This was on Friday. We spoke for hours kissed and enjoyed each other's company. The next day I didn't hear from him much, but he invited me to meet him at a gathering in the evening. He ended up leaving the place so we didn't meet. I messaged him good morning the next morning and he didn't respond, but after a day it said he read it. I waited a few days and then decided to call him yesterday. He didn't answer or call or message me back, but he watched my Instagram story. 
I'm sooo hurt and confused. One of my triggers is rejection. So I've broken down completely. 
To make things worse, my favourite person (my friend) told me she wasn't feeling good so she'd get back to me about my message I sent her on Monday and I haven't heard from her since. Then I saw today on her status that she's gone to a spa hotel and is happy and fine. I just feel like no-one cares about me and I'm not important and not good enough. I can't stop crying and I feel like there must be something wrong with me."
First fight with my boyfriend and I feel broken,3,mhg18a,1,"Last night I got into somewhat of a fight with my boyfriend/fp of 5 months, and it's the first time it escalated like this. Long story short, after work he said he was having a bad day and that I could come over if I want, but he wouldn't be in the best of moods. I wanted to be supportive, so I went over even though I just started Wellbutrin and my anxiety is through the roof. He seemed to be slowly cheering up, and things were good until I had a panic attack from a combination of the new meds, going through a change at work, having not slept in 2 days, and being hungry. 

He noticed me crying, asked what was wrong, and I told him exactly that and expressed that I felt bad for putting attention on me when he was feeling bad. He got super quiet and starting deep breathing, I apologized again and he apologized for not knowing what to say. I told him it was fine and that all I really wanted was a hug, which he gave me. Then he went downstairs and had an emotional outburst of his own. I could hear him throwing things and punching walls, and I felt so bad. I feel like I messed up. When he came back upstairs, he got super crossfaded and pretended like nothing happened. Things still feel super tense, though.

I'm so scared that he's going to break up with me over this. I hope he doesn't throw things away over one rough night, but with bpd it's hard to see any other end to this."
self esteem,1,mhfqc2,1,Is there someone who managed to get through the low self-esteem problem? I don t know how to make myself better so I can stop seeking validation... The person who I'm in a relationship with supports me and loves me and validates my emotions every time... they try their best to make me feel better and I want to show them that I'm doing my best too. But my self-esteem is... like... uhmmm non-existent. And I don't know how to fix that...
I do digital art and I want to make a character with BPD and would like some tips!,0,mhfhil,1,"A few loved ones of mine have been diognosed with bpd so I was thinking of using bpd to make a more realistic character. 

I've read about some stuff but i doubt it's enough to really get someones feelings and way of thinking. If you don't mind could you tell me a bit about yourself and give me some tips on making a character that accurately shows bpd? Or any tips at all for making a realistic character.

Do you always experience symptoms of bpd, do you/how do you mask your symptoms and what do you think when doing so?

Sorry if this intrusive at all."
Bpd and loss,3,mhfeom,2,"So my mom has always been my ultimate FP. She was always a huge support for me in my life and through my struggles. I usually have a “regular” FP, the person who has held that place for me has been my guy friend of a year and a half. Through that time we were always extremely close, hung out ALL the time, and he was very helpful in being there for me. Well last October, my mom passed away from cancer. I really don’t have any words to say about it, it’s like there’s a hole in my heart and a black cloud looming over my life. I don’t really talk about it or show the world how it’s effecting me, she’s just gone. Now recently, my guy friend made a new friend and he wants to spend ALL of his time with him. Whenever I go over to his house, he’s hanging out with him for maybe 90% of the time and then for a few minutes, he’ll come hang out with me. I was okay with hanging out with both of them at first, but this new friend is constantly saying something prejudice or homophobic, and my friend gets mad at me when I try to call him out, he just wants me to let that stuff he says go. I feel like I’ve lost the people in my life that care about me, and there’s nothing much left anymore and I’m really struggling"
Mother's relationships triggering me.,2,mhfee3,1,"I'm going to try to summarize this as best I can, but throughout my life my mother has had numerous relationships. I've often felt as if my mother depends and relies on me for validation and attention when she's single, but then she'll enter a new relationship with a man and essentially ""forget"" about me. She stops reaching out as often. She's harder to get in touch with and she becomes less empathetic. I feel abandoned and rejected. I'm fucking 29, but it still gets to me. I don't know how to feel or if I'm being selfish, but I feel like my emotions are justified and I'm sick and tired of her using me when she needs me and then brushing me aside like I'm nothing when she doesn't need me anymore."
Living hell,10,mhf1gm,2,"I wanted to do something today. I have felt different yesterday. I will feel different tomorrow. Nothing is persistent, nothing. Everything changes so frequently. It is impossible to achieve anything great and meaningful, no matter how much I want... but I know I will stop wanting it eventually, maybe tomorrow, maybe in the next hour, maybe even before I finish this. It doesn't matter, my views are different each day. 

People are simple, people are persistent. They are who they are and they are who they have always been. Change is what I am. Nothing is permanent. Achieving anything socially related is impossible. I have given up trying.

Work. Work helps me forget. Reading helps me forget. Born to suffer. Life is empty. Life is terribly long. I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of my condition. There is no future, there is no past.

Religion doesn't work. Alcohol doesn't work. Nothing works. Nothing calms me down when it comes. Working myself to death works. I forget. I put my attention elsewhere.

Life expectancy is about 80 years for men in the developed countries. It means that from this moment I've only recently finished the first quarter. It scares me."
What does resentment mean?,1,mhf0xw,2,"Not sure how reddit works, so please excuse any mistakes.

I’m a 17 y/o male and have recently become friends with a classmate who has BPD. Today he told me he “resented” me and that it was most likely because of his BPD. 

I will admit it hasn’t been a smooth relationship but we’ve havent fought before. He just has a really hard time respecting my boundaries and i’ve been really serious about him sticking to the boundaries we set.

[he told me he was feeling manic so maybe me asking him to stick to our boundaries was a trigger?]

at the moment, i’m finding it hard to understand the word “resentment”.

Does resentment mean something different in terms of BPD? if so is there anything i can do to help him? I won’t force him to be my friend if he doesn’t want to be, i’m just curious. 

thank you for reading"

Any advice on making a first therapy appointment.,2,mhe5mo,0,"Years ago I started to see a therapist for major depressive disorder after a breakdown. After several months of therapy I was diagnosed with BPD traits and was referred over to a DBT therapist. I immediately took a dislike to the DBT therapist and decided that I was done with the therapy bs and branched out on my own. Since then I haven't been doing horrible but lately I've been slipping back into old ruts and want to give therapy another try.

I found a place in my town that looks like it would be ok but I have no idea how to actually make the appointment and that terrifies me. What do I tell them? What do they ask? I know that you should go into therapy with a goal in mind but the only thing I can think of is ""I want to stop feeling like crap"".

Any advice?"

I cant interact with anyone without them feeling obligated to help me and having no idea how and then they feel bad, which in turn makes me feel horrible. Every one of my friends I somehow tell them too much about my life and they just stare and go ""I'm so sorry but I don't know how to help."" Everytime I hear that my heart drops. Great, I've done it again. What the fuck do I do. I'm currently isolating myself until I find just some sort of plan to limit my oversharing but I'm having a difficult time.

Can Anyone Recommend A Good BPD Therapist in the SF Bay Area?,0,mhdy9h,0,Hi Everyone. I am looking for a good BPD therapist recommendation from those of you who live in the area and have already been through this research phase. I am finding the process rather daunting. Thanks in advance!
DAE want to reject your progress and recovery?,8,mhdwb0,4,For the past few months or so I would say I’ve gotten pretty okay and stabilised in a sense and not as self destructive as I used to be. Things are going okay for me but for some reason I wanna to reject everything and go back to that dark period of my life. I want to go back to those days where I was immensely self destructive and romanticised it and I want to stop taking my medication and stop seeking help. Does feel like doing this ? I don’t understand where this is coming from and why I think like this.
“Meatball Surgery” challenging perfectionism,6,mhdw2w,2,"I learned a useful metaphor from my therapist to challenge perfectionism and I wanted to share. It comes from the book/movie M.A.S.H. (Mobil Army Surgical Hospital). The concept is called meatball surgery. Apparently when wounded soldiers came to MASH, they were badly wounded and in need of immediate quick surgery in order to hold them over until they could be transported to a real hospital. This example uses a soldier with a serious intestinal wound. There are 3 walls to the intestine, and in a regular hospital, it is best practice to sew each layer individually. However, in the MASH unit, the patients with these injuries were so badly injured and there were so many to get to, that there was not time to see each layer on its own. Rather, “meatball surgery” was used, and all three layers were sutured at once. If the doctors in the MASH unit had tried to follow “best practices” and sew each layer one at a time, more people would die than if they used meatball surgery and got a lot of patients sewed up good enough” to be transported. I am working to apply this concept to my own life. This metaphor helps me to remember that sometimes doing something “perfect” actually prevents me from seeing the bigger picture and making the most of my time. It reminds me that sometimes doing “good enough” is actually better in the long run than striving for perfection. Idk if this will help anyone else but it was kind of a breakthrough for me so thought I’d share just in case. ❤️💪"
why do i only crave intimacy instead of a real relationship,1,mhdrzl,3,"i honestly have no clue if what i’m about to talk about has anything to do with BPD, but i don’t know where else to talk about this, & i’d like to know if anyone else ever feels this way. anyway, over some time, i’ve realized that it is very rare for me to catch feelings for anyone. & its even more rare for me to actually want a relationship with someone. regardless of that though, i still find myself obsessing over guys who are attractive/have good personalities BUT not because i want a relationship, but because i want some sort of intimacy with them. i like the attention, i like giving attention, i like the excitement of it, but i do not like commitment or treating them like a boyfriend. its kind of annoying that all my brain ever wants is intimacy instead of a true relationship, but i really don’t know why & would like to know if any of yall ever feel this way."
I need help,1,mhdrsx,0,"My fiancée has bi polar disorder and I’ve been the worst support for her over the last two years. We have been together for a little over six years and for the most part things have been wonderful. It’s when she gets set off that I’ve let her down. I let her triggers affect me and I haven’t listened or better yet paid attention or have done enough research until recently to realize how bad that is for her. I ended up making her think so much is her fault when it’s not. On the brink of losing her along with our two sons because she can’t take the bickering anymore. It’s every week at this point. Nothing is worth losing them over. I know I can be better to her with her needs now but I don’t know if it’s too late. I also have ptsd and depression and I’ve been so stupid and naive to her mental health needs. I love her and our family. Now after trying one day she still doesn’t know if things will be better and I don’t feel like I’ll ever get the chance to show her.

How to not obsess over symptoms?,1,mhcw9h,4,"I’m a classic quite BPD case, and i’ve managed to get all of my symptoms under control without a therapist ( no insurance). This took all of quarantine and a lot of self reflection to get to this point, but even seeing a list of all the symptoms ( or others) makes me spiral and think how am i gonna control this everyday. ( i.e stopping myself from wanting to lash outward, make purchases without making myself wait a day and see if i still want it, thinking in a bigger picture and consequences to impulses, etc) 

It’s a conscious effort, sometimes I get really tired and let it slip but i’m glad i can be aware of what i’m doing and stop it before it spirals and won’t take it for granted. I am wondering if anyone has some methods that help them remember you have it under control and you’re doing your best. Thank you in advance :-)"
I was just diagnosed,3,mhcvhw,4,So I was just diagnosed with bpd after being told I had depression a an anxiety only since I was 16.

Psychologist is booked and I’m really going through it I had an outburst,1,mhcc0o,0,I’m going to be honest I’m drained still don’t even want to type it out I just want someone to talk to I called Kaiser because I wanted to see if it was possible for me to have a one time appointment with a different psychologist that has an available opening because I’m having a hard time she didn’t listen to me when I said my psychologist told me there isn’t anything available till May but I need someone to talk to NOW not in 2 months this week has been hell so far.
I feel like a horrible person.,1,mhc9es,0,"
First of all I want to state that I am 18 years old with a plethora of mental health issues. I currently have BED (Binge Eating Disorder), Clinical Depression, and BPD. Recently, I have started to realize of how horrible and toxic of a person I am. I have lost several friends because of my actions and because I don’t necessarily think before I speak. One instance that immediately comes to mind is that I lost a group of my friends because of a very bad mental breakdown I had with them over text and the words I said during that time. I told them all goodbye and just felt really defeated in that moment and then ten minutes later I have the campus police busting into my room and an officer with a hand on his gun while I was getting ready to try and sleep it off in just a long t shirt and underwear. I was immediately terrified because I am a black woman and all of my friends knew this and were black as well. The officer scared the hell out of me and I had to deal with this issue by myself. After the officer left, I immediately confronted my friends and asked them why they called the police without talking to me and checking on me first and how they even found the information of my school as we were internet friends only. They told me that I had no right to be angry at them and that I was triggering to them and they all just left me that same night and never talked to me again. I even reached out to them later and apologized for how I acted and they didn’t even care. I feel like a horrible person because of my BPD and I often speak or say things without thinking if it could offend someone and it causes me to lose friends often. What do I do? I feel horrible for how I acted in that situation and no one will hear me out on my apology."
I’ve officially made it a week without self harm.,61,mhbxpa,15,"The last time I self harmed resulted in a pretty severe burn, which has barely healed. After than I knew I had to stop. It’s now been a full week of no self harm. I feel really uneasy, but I believe that it will hopefully be worth it. Little steps."
Don’t think I can ever give 100% of myself to anyone,6,mhbu5w,7,"Anyone else feel like no matter how much you care or how strongly you feel about someone, you just can’t fully give yourself 100%? I just feel like a part of me will always have an escape plan in the back of my mind, just in case one day I wake up and convince myself that the happiness I have is just a fantasy. I recently have found someone who makes me happier than ever, but I just can’t fully allow myself to just let my guard down and to just relax and allow myself to fully invest and give my all without any doubts or worries. Obviously BPD and self sabotage go hand in hand together since having a distorted sense of self worth is almost a daily struggle. I guess I’m just wondering if I ever will be able to just relax fully in my relationship and have peace of mind that everything is perfectly okay and enjoy it fully and whole heartedly?"
I can't decide if I should break up with my FP or not,1,mhbnvn,1,"She wants distance and isn't texting me much, which I did hurt her in the past so the logical side of me understands that maybe that's all she really wants, space to breathe. But the emotional side of me is assuming that she is just getting ready to break up with me (even though we still hang out once or twice a week) 
Our relationship was very codependent and we both agreed that in order for us to stay together we must gain some independence, but its hurting me a lot. I don't know if it would be better to stay in the relationship and try to build myself up at the same time or just bail and learn to be alone without her. I keep going back and forth based on her responses or mood that day, and its getting exhausting. I'm not sure what to do at all."
How do you cope with the lockdown loneliness?,6,mhbhkv,1,"Today felt like one of the loneliest days I have ever had. Actually the last couple of days have all felt like that. 

Across my laptop and my phone my screen time averages to nearly 13 hours a day which I find quite embarrassing. I keep deleting social media apps to get some momentum into my life outside of the digital world but it always comes back before I fall asleep. 

My screen time was a bit lesser today as I spent a good while just crying. But it was still enough thats I read every single post that was posted on this sub in the last week. It kind of gave me a sense of feeling less lonely as I had people I could relate to. I have no way of stepping outside my house to talk to physical human beings. I feel like if covid drags on for a few more months I'll just completely get detached from the real world. 

Has anyone struggled with a digital screen ""addiction"" and if yes how do I fix this and have a normal relationship with my phone and social media?"
Giving Up,0,mhb0p7,0,"Guess who's homeless lol. For two months I've done everything but scream in people's faces to get help and now TODAY people are finally coming to help me? I told them to all fuck off it's too late man. I've been trying for two months. I didn't even want to leave but my roommate is so selfish that she made the decision for me even though she's been here about once a week for the past two months and her boyfriend has lived here rent free for three years. I wish I could be one of her friends who gives her rides or buys her things so she would actually be nice to me; but I don't. That's reserved for work friends or people who drive. Social services won't help, Realtors won't help, no one seems to really see that I'm about to fucking explode? I can't wait to be dead holy shit. You work SO HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY and life spits in your fucking face and pushes you in the dirt. I can only justify the acts that have been commited against me since I was a tiny baby as ultrasonic karma; my previous life was something so unspeakable I must be paying for eons. Why am I so eager to love and support everyone when they could give a flying fuck whether I'm alive or dead? I'm done waiting for other people I want to vomit."
"Not panicked, not me.",1,mhau8h,2,"My best friend just casually mentioned on the phone that she's looking for new friends that share her interests and hobbies. Someone more active and can push her to be more active too. I'm disabled and can't be that active, and not coordinated enough to engage in her hobbies. She said outright ""I'm not replacing you,"" because she knows how I am and how this will make me feel. In spite of that, and even KNOWING that she's telling the truth, I still felt this awful sensation of falling. Whooshing in my ears. Eyes filling with tears. I couldn't hear her voice anymore over my own thoughts that I'm not good enough, I'm lazy, I drag others down with me, and she's going to find someone amazing that she'll love so much more and forget all about me. Obviously I can't share with her how bad that simple statement made me feel, because I don't want her to feel guilty for wanting to better herself or expressing that to me, but I had to tell somebody. Hi. Advice or kind words or anything you want to say is welcome."
Need to be prettiest,17,mhaokm,4,"I struggle with BDD too but this feeling I am on about is kind of different, I have this need to be the most beautiful woman in the entire world and for everyone to think this! Every woman, every man even though I have a BF, modelling agents and brands who hire for jobs and of course especially my BF. I want everyone to think I’m the most stunning girl ever. I am a model and went into modelling for validation. I’ve always been complimented with people saying I am the most beautiful woman they’ve ever seen many times I think this is what makes me feel the need for EVERYONE to think it I’m addicted to validation. I won’t ever be seen without makeup or hair done as it’s less than perfect. I need to be stunning I need everyone to dream of being me of being with me but I HATE this need - I am a kind person who cares not at all about the appearance of others I will never entertain any kind of bitching especially negativity about people’s appearance. I don’t even care about looks in a relationship at all although my partner is v attractive. I get constant extreme validation that I’m stunning and the best looking woman they know but it’s still not enough and if I don’t get a compliment or everyone looks at me except one or if I feel are people looking at me way less as I drive by bc I have no makeup on when really people are looking at me I just more so notice ones doing their own thing who wouldn’t have noticed me makeup or not bc they just weren’t even looking. I wish I could explain the episodes this creates for me my bf has always said I’m most beautiful woman ever why are you with me his friends family colleagues joke this to him too and that I’m stunning he says I’m perfect and tells me constantly of all the compliments people tell him about me and they make me feel great but not that great yet one look or one comment I could take a diff meaning like say someone says someone is attractive whilst I’m there my illogical brain says why didn’t they say but they’re not better than you etc even if it’s a friend saying oh Margot Robbie looks nice there I think is she way better than me anything can cause a major spiral and I hate it it feels narcissistic but I’m not and I hate feeling this way bc I don’t care about looks I’m so kind and loving but I can spiral at my bf even if someone pretty on tv I say you must fancy them he’s like what?

Finding a therapist,1,mham8i,2,"I'm not sure if its just me, or if others have this issue, but I am really struggling to find a therapist. I have seen a few in the past and they just weren't challenging me or pushing me to where I needed to get to. I live in the US and there are plenty of therapists in my city, just not many who work with BPD. I haven't had a ""formal"" diagnosis but I have had 2 psychiatrists tell me I have all the traits and signs of BPD.

Any advice on how to find someone would be totally awesome!"
"I’m depressed, physically unwell with anxiety and occasionally fantasising about just disappearing magically, if only.",2,mhaj5y,2,"Went for a walk in the nearby countryside yesterday, I hadn’t been to that trail before and I’m glad I chose it because it was just lovely, peaceful scenery, by a river with nice falls. I love walking these kinds of places, just out past where the crowds of families go to walk it’s peaceful. Often when I’m out walking I find myself laughing out loud with pure joy at how breathtakingly lovely the place is. I had that experience yesterday. The walk and the fresh air calmed some of the physical anxiety symptoms that have been escalating in me for a couple of weeks. I could breathe easier, my heart wasn’t in overdrive after a little while walking. Yet I’ve still spent today mostly in bed, getting up for snacks and having to run to the toilet a few times because my IBS is 95% triggered by stress. Pretty similar to how I’ve been most days for the past while. 

Things to take the edge off are just that, they aren’t a magic cure. Weighted teddy also helps me feel less tension but I still am so physically unwell right now, I still can’t face cooking anything that takes more effort than turning on the oven, I still have a piles of dirty laundry in every room of my house. 

I’m facing 4 university assignments due in the next 2.5-3 weeks. It’s doable as long as I get a start on them this week and I don’t technically need to get a “good” grade, just to pass, but I’m scared and I can’t quite fully understand why because rationally, I’ve always managed at least good work, usually very good. I think this is what’s mostly triggering how unwell I am. 

I also feel desperately lonely. I’m living alone because it’s what makes the most sense for me and my situation. Living with family wasn’t appropriate and I didn’t want to live in a shared place with strangers, not feeling 100% secure of relying on others in order to maintain a sense of home. I have more space living alone a tiny bit further out but still very accessible from a major town for less rent than I could be paying on a shared place, so it makes sense that way but right now it kills social possibilities. I have the odd friend here and there but haven’t really ever been close to anyone outside of romantic interests. COVID has obviously shut down the possibility of just being around a group of people which was the majority of my social interaction, I don’t really have anyone to text or call with regularly right now. 

I don’t think most people really appreciate what it’s like to be coming from behind socially without this experience? I know I’m making the most appropriate choices for me personally but it might not look that way to someone who doesn’t know my whole picture. I come across as odd and a bit withdrawn, I often hear assumptions that I’m not interested in being friends with someone when it’s really the exact opposite, and I just want to be wanted for me. I really just have so many negative experiences that I don’t want to force myself onto people anymore. 

 I’m fed up of feeling so physically unwell with depression and anxiety. I seem have less energy than the typical person seems to have. I worked out that to work a typical job as well as taking care of themselves, their home, at a bare minimum they’d be awake and fully functioning for at least 13 hours a day, and many people manage even more than that. I’ve never had a chance to try to sustain that lifestyle but I typically don’t manage that kind of energy more than 50% of the time. I think it’d help having a more structured day and week though, so I’m hopeful for when I do professional placements as part of my course this time next year to get an understanding of how I can manage that. 

This probably wasn’t great to read, it’s definitely just a vent because I’m not feeling good at all but I’d be appreciative of any comments or anything, just to hear from another person."
DAE feel like they never really lived freely? + age anxiety,12,mhahm9,10,"I am an extremely co-dependent person. When I say this I really mean it. I am in relationships since I am 17. I was single maximum 2 months.

I don't feel safe alone. Yet I never experienced living life when I only care about myself. Like I can go to a festival and hookup with somebody if I like. Or just talk and have fun with guys without wondering when will I have to reject them (since I have a bf). Or have sexual experiences which I cannot live with my boyfriend. Anything. Or just go abroad without worrying about him cheating. Really anything!

I have no clue how it is to be single. I don't complain because I might simply would be dysfunctional. But still I wonder.

On top of it I have age anxiety (especially since this pandemic) and wonder whether I will ever really live a colourful life or I will be too old and just regret that I have never lived.

(Age anxiety is extra strong because I never had problems with guys finding me attractive but I know that age doesn't have mercy on anybody and one day I won't be as desirable as I am now.)"
"advice from borderline to borderline: people in your life are not obsessing, remembering, or holding grudges against your small mistakes as much as you are. You are doing that to yourself.",901,mha8kz,51,"The biggest moment of growth in my life as a borderline was accepting the fact that neurodivergence/atypicality means I can't fairly apply my own sensitive, obsessive thinking to how others perceive me. I worry about extraordinary circumstances because I am not normal, but most people think completely differently.

Example, when I flub up a word in a conversation, or forget to say sorry 3 times, nobody is going to be thinking about that in an hour. They will be thinking about writing, baseball, food, their car. This is the way most people live their life without splitting or obsession. I had to be taught that. I do not have to punish myself by thinking everybody hates me when my actions are insignificant to them in comparison to how I evaluate myself.

I hope this gives some peace as much as it does for me."
"[24M] lost Psychiatric, DBT, and Therapy services yesterday - FUCK the system",10,mha3w6,6,"Ready for stupid and long story that shows how fucked up the system really is?

So, for 14 months I have been doing psychiatric and therapy services at, lets say, ""K"". My first 2 psychiatrists, by the way, were terrible. My current/former one, DrF, is fantastic and she really listened to me.

A few months ago, my therapist FC recommended I do an IOP. So DrF made the referral when I brought it up so it goes by faster than having FC make it. DrF also makes the DBT group referral the same day, with the wait list being approximately TWO MONTHS long for me to start.

IOP starts 1 month later.

So I do IOP with AW. She is really good, and she recommended this program for BPD that K contracts out with LL. AW makes the initial referal and I try to go into it - and everything starts going to hell (not that I knew it yet).

I finish IOP after 1 month, I do a transitional, less-intensive IOP which is just stage 2. I start DBT at the same day as transitional IOP (magic, I know).

Then I talk to DrF again at a new appointment and suddenly she says she received a message that day she isn't supposed to see me anymore because I have been transferred to the county (NOT AT MY REQUEST, but at a ""contractual obligiation that K has""). She said she kept the appointment for me anyway because she knew just having no notification or advice is wrong.

I file a complaint with K's member services. My case manager says my therapy and DBt won't be affected and that only psychiatry is. Two weeks later, yesterday - I get 2 calls, fiirst saying my individual therapy is cancelled, and then another 10 minutes later saying DBT is cancelled (AFTER I WAS IN THE PROGRAM FOR A MONTH AFTER BEING ON THE WAITLIST FOR 2 MONTHS)

Why was I sent to county? Because of the severity of my symptoms - but they have been the SAME FOR 14 MONTHS. Why now? Because of trying to get into that program AW recommended that THE COUNTY DOESNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT OR CONTRACT WITH.

There is no continuing care right now after suddenly losing all my behavioral health services.

My case will be reviewed by a panel of chief psychiatrists tomorrow to see if the mandated transference to county is ""valid"" or not. I also filed a complaint this morning with the county department of behavioral health for making me lose ALL of my services, having no continuing care, AND having LESS services than K provides to begin with.

The system is completely fucked up. All because AW said to do this program that she worked in that K contracts with, and it made me lose EVERYTHING.

Even if I can go back to services at K and get my psychiatrist and therapist back, my place in DBT is absolutely fucked. 3 months down the drain. It might take up to SEVEN MORE MONTHS to get back to where I was in DBT.

I really, really, really, am tempted to just go take that bus ride and jump off the Golden Gate Bridge and die. Because this completely ruined me yesterday. I cried for the first time in a very long and I almost broke my no self-harming over a year and I unfortunately yelled at my cat and scared her (I did not do anything physical, just yelling)

Fuck the system. Fuck being alive."
Why am I so incompetent?,2,mh9abu,2,"I live with a friend in a 2 bed flat. When she is home everything works. I am able to get myself up, showered, dressed etc. I can eat 3 meals a day, hold down a job, do household chores.

All of this changes if I'm by myself. I can just about get myself to work but that is it. No eating. No cleaning. No showering. Rubbish everywhere. Dirty dishes everywhere. Even on my days off work I just sit there, doing nothing.

It's like I'm watching myself on the outside and screaming at myself to at least do something but I can't. It's been 7 days and I've got another 5 left. I spoke with my therapist and we agreed I should sort out the flat and start again but I just can't do it. Why am I like this? Why can I not function like I should? It is taking every bit of energy to not go and throw myself in front of a train right now. But I'm pretty sure everyone would be better off if I did."
Book recommendations?,1,mh947g,0,"I heard great things about The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, so I had purchased it, read it, and loved it. He discusses some really great strategies that could definitely benefit someone dealing with BPD. Does anyone else have any other book recommendations that would be similar to this?"
No wonder I am who I am,40,mh8ied,12,"My mom is a manipulative bitch. I always kinda knew that. We fought a lot when I was younger because she would let all her frustration out on me. I live with my boyfriend most of the time to avoid her, but every now and then I visit my parents. Well today she yelled at me because I literally couldn’t read her mind. She wanted me to get something from the pharmacy without telling me. She said I could have known. I even offered to get it anyway, even tho she just yelled at me and then walked away. But of course she didn’t take that offer because then she couldn’t have called me a selfish bitch without any empathy for other people (yeah right, me, who is about to work in the mental health field because I do care). Anyway she continued to tell me how awful I am for a few minutes. I usually would have snapped in no time but I just stayed calm and said that I won’t argue with her about a misunderstanding. As expected this made her even more furious but I didn’t care. I really felt the urge to selfharm, but I didn’t. I think it was the first time I thought to myself ”I’m better than this. I don’t deserve this“. So I guess this is a small triumph for me. I have never seen the reason for my mental illness so clearly it was almost like a wake up call.
Anyway, thanks for reading. I love you guys. Keep fighting!❤️✨"
Giving Up,10,mh83zd,2,"Monday night I wrecked my car.  I was driving through the country, didn't realize a turn was coming, and went to veer out of the way.  Ended up hitting a bump that through my car through the air, Dukes of Hazzard style.  I'm okay.  Just hit my head a little and I'm sore.

But this was our only working car.  Our other 2 cars are also in the shop.  We never got our stimulus, so we were already struggling.  I'm just tired of never getting ahead, of being an idiot and making things worse.

My marriage is falling apart (he has downloaded dating apps, but claims he was just looking at it for porno purposes, but this makes me feel unwanted/unloved).  We have different love languages and can't ever seem to connect.  Everything he does annoys me.  Add onto the above mentioned issues, I'm experiencing limerence for another, too.  I want to just scrap my marriage that sucks and pursue the limerence, but I'm not 100% sure it is reciprocated.

Everything is just confusing and awful.  I have been microdosing, and it was working at first, but now it's just like regular medication--the suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety always comes back.  Therapy is slow-going. 

I'm just tired.  Tired of always trying to fight against this disorder, against the current. Tired of DBT and always being hyper aware of my moods and triggers. I just want to LIVE. I want to just wake up and go through my day without dissecting everything. I want to just be okay, just be happy once in a while. Tired of drama and money issues.

I wish I would have died in that car accident.  Going to the ER for suicidal ideation doesn't help either.  They just band-aid you with meds and pat you on the head and send you back out into the world."
"Back in the outskirts of my life, hurts worse than ever.",2,mh7v8t,1,"Hopefully this type of rant is allowed

Background:
About half a year ago I had this really good friend, you know how it goes. FP, I just wanna spend time with them, no matter what that time includes. She and I had slept together a couple times (she came onto me cuz I'm terrified of rejection so I never make the first move) but she made it clear she wanted nothing more than regular friendship afterwards. That was cool with me. I just wanted to be around her whenever our schedules and her mental health allowed.

Some things happened to me (TW: r*pe/assault) and I reached out to my FP for support while I processed it. She said she would be there for me. After a few days/week tops of her ""being there"" which only included me messaging her a few times (literally at most 3 messages a day, stuff like ""its in my head again"" ""i freaked out when someone hugged me."") She blocked me on everything.

I found out from a mutual friend that she did it to teach me not to blow her up. After two weeks of being blocked, she unblocked me, refused to talk about it, but wanted us to continue our friendship as normal. We hung out a couple times and it was cool. Just us chilling and watching tv, showing eachother memes. No problems.

I sent her a meme a day after out last hangout and she blocked me again. Found out from different mutuals that she posted in a vague status about how I was a manipulator by using my trauma to get close to her and force her into a relationship. She also blocked my best friend/her close friend because she knew my best friend would take my side.

Recent:
She unblocked me like 2 weeks ago. No friend requests or messages. But she isn't the type to unblock someone unless she has a reason (i.e. was teaching a lesson) and my paranoia has gotten so great over the past few months that i have distances myself from EVERYONE that i knew is or ever was friends with her. And with it being so close to April Fools I'm actually stressing she is going to try to talk to me as a joke. 

Now i'm not just diagnosed with bpd but also bipolar and her unblocking me triggered a bpd high which lead into a 2+ week (still going) bipolar manic episode which is heightening all of my bpd issues. Now i'm just trying to get some of these feelings out since i pushed all my close friends away.

Ty for listening."
FP cut me off again and my dad has cancer,2,mh7jdv,1,"My FP and I have had many ups and downs over the last year, you know how it is—the highs are high and the lows are low. 

Recently we got into another fight as a result of my mood swings and constant need for validation. He says the way I act is selfish. 

Through all the pain, however, I’ve still considered this person one of my best friends. I’ve opened up to them in ways I haven’t with anyone else. I cling to them and definitely see them as a support system. But now we’re in a phase of no contact and it’s tearing me apart. 

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and it’s really taking a toll on me. My parents are divorced and my mom lives in a different state and I’m an only child. I don’t have a close family support system. And now with my best friend cutting me off (they know about my dad’s sickness too) I feel so lost and alone. 

I’m just so sad. I feel hopeless. Any advice or support or words of encouragement are appreciated."
Feeling grey - 24F,4,mh7fsh,2,"I honestly don't know where to start. I've never been officially diagnosed, but I've thought of possible reasons for feeling this way - depression, bipolar disorder II and finally this. Everything makes more sense now. As a kid I've always thought that my family is the unluckiest family in the world because I'm in it. Because they have me. Because I am me and not anyone else. That most of my friendships start great early on and then slowly become worse. That I've never had stable relationships. I have a hard time trusting anyone fully, even if they have the best of interests. And as much as I don't want to fully blame it on my upbringing, I think I have to give my parents some of that. They weren't totally abusive, but I felt emotionally neglected as a kid. My dad is basically hot and cold. One moment he would be aggressively angry at me (over something I did that angered him), and then suddenly he becomes this nice saint like creature treating me ever so kindly. So kindly I almost forgot what ever happened before. But I never forget. And then he would apologize. It was like two different personalities. And the cycle continues. It felt like walking on seashells whenever he is around. My mom on the other hand, would disregard my feelings, even though I am right and have a point. She would half heartedly apologize if it was her wrong. And she doesn't want to acknowledge negative feelings even though they are real. Always masking them with some fake positivity. I guess that made me who I am today. But even though they are responsible for my trauma, I am responsible for my own healing. Its just that right now and for several years now - my emotions are a wreck. I can be crying, be so so sad and then to happy and cheerful in just a few hours sometimes. Last year, I've thought about actually ending it three times. And its usually on an impulse. But I've never done it because there were things holding me back in the last minute. I am afraid when this happens.  And I really want to get help. But I can't bring myself to it. 
Right now I'm feeling grey. It is a colourful world indeed, but I can't seem to see it right now.."
I need coping mechanisms to help me with losing my FP,6,mh7au2,4,"My favorite person has been my boyfriend for the past year, we recently broke up but we’re still friends. He told me he thinks he might be moving, and i don’t know how to cope with that. Ive tried to do things to distract my brain but everything i do reminds me of him and then i get sad again. I don’t know what to do because it feels like i lost such an important part of myself."
Anger issues,3,mh6rx8,4,Could anyone explain why some people with bpd have severe anger issues? my friend is a quiet borderline and he doesn't act out but there's a lot of anger inside. he can identify himself with very violent people and I'm struggling to understand because parts of him are very kind.
Impulsivity strikes again,1,mh6j43,1,"I was upset with my boyfriend over something that was said (I honestly don't remember). A friend of mine was looking for an apartment and I told her I'd move in with her. We signed a lease, paid first months rent, all that jazz. 
The apartment is 3 hours away. I don't have a job. I filled out like 80 applications and have gotten 2 calls for interviews but no call back. 
I also don't want to move anymore. I was mad when I did what I did. 
My boyfriend and I have 3 kids together-- I was going to take them with, I don't want to go though. I don't know what to do.

I'm scared to talk to my friend about it, she's going through a break up and a lot of other things. 

Someone please help me. :("
I'm desperately scared of *not* having borderline,2,mh6cwm,7,"I keep coming across posts about people who aren't ""really"" BPD, and it worries me. For context, I'm self-diagnosed, with one therapist saying I have it (or maybe just entertaining me?) and one saying I don't. I picked up *I Hate You, Don't Leave Me* in a mental hospital a while back and it resonated with me, so I did my own research and thought I had it. It was immensely relieving to realize that other people feel the same things I do, and it became a part of my identity.

I got into a relationship four months ago with an amazing guy and it makes me feel so much better, so my borderline characteristics have waned. For some reason, instead of being relieved, I'm scared. Who am I without BPD? It scares me and makes me want to hurt myself any time I come across something that reminds me that I may not really be borderline and I don't know why it hurts me so badly. Advice is absolutely welcomed, I'm not sure what to do."
New to meds / prozac,1,mh6bnj,2,"25/F, Hi everyone, hope you are doing okay. I was recently diagnosed with bpd/eupd and prescribed Quetiapine at first but because depression + anxiety is more of a problem I asked to try antidepressants so was prescribed Prozac Fluoxetine 20mg. Anyone here have BPD and taking prozac??,


 I'm very nervous to start taking them right now, like having a mini anxiety attack over it! I need a little push 


any positive stories/ helpful experiences please, thank you.. I just feel sad all the time, a deep sadness that never goes away, I get very bad days/episodes of depression and anxiety. I just want to feel happiness every day man. I want to start living my life."
Does anyone else constantly assume everything is their own fault?,278,mh65zy,34,"Literally any inconvenience or insecure feeling I have, I blame it on myself. Even if I did nothing wrong objectively, I frantically search in my head for something that I may have done. Boyfriend hasn’t answered me in 3 hours? I did something wrong to upset him. Boyfriend didn’t send a heart back? I did something to cause him to lose feelings. I just constantly feel like a terrible person and that I’m constantly causing people harm.

Why is being perfect not enough to avoid abandonment?,23,mh638t,13,"TW: severe domestic violence

I’m seriously having a spiral here. I just wantvto be loved so bad but it’s like I can’t be. There is something repulsive inside me that means people won’t stay. I have largely recovered, I’m a good partner and I have a lot of other good qualities, but it’s never enough. I have to be ABSOLUTELY perfect and that’s only so people will kiiinda like me. No one will ever love me. And it hurts even worse because others who are abusive or toxic have loyal partners. Whywon’t anyone love me like that?? E.g., the last man I dated had stayed with someone for 6+ years who tried to kill and mutilate him. But he refused to commit and just strung me along and then threw me away when he got bored. And I’m lucky - before that, my other ex would threaten to leave me any time I showed emotion or disagreeed, and then left me after he seriously assaulted me. Why am I not enough??? What am Insupposed to do? What are ithers doing that they can find love and a loyal partner while they abuse them but I can’t? I feel so hopeless"
DAE have worse symptoms in the morning upon waking up?,16,mh5ubw,11,"Idk if this is a bpd thing or if i’m just awful, but i wake up feeling everything all at once and i am the angriest, meanest, most emotional and overwhelmed person in the morning. i cry, i yell, i say awful things, and i have majorrrr executive dysfunction and it’s so difficult and frustrating to start the day like that. i just wanna be normal. anyone else experience this? does anyone have any coping skills that might help?"
"there's no winning, the outcomes are the same",1,mh5ly9,1,"sorry about this and feel free to completely ignore but i had to let it out somewhere. (TW: suicide is mentioned briefly) 

im so terribly scared to lose him to the point i want to push him away. if i stop talking to him then he cant get annoyed or bored of me and its impossible to say something wrong if im not saying anything. if i leave now then im hurting myself rather than letting him hurt me. im scared to say something wrong or to fuck something up and its stressing me out to the point i cant enjoy anything. i love him and i know he loves me too but my brain won't stop. one of the main reasons for wanting to end my life was so this wouldnt happen again but the whole reason i stuck around was because i found him. im so mad at myself for letting this happen. all my emotions are so uncontrollable when it comes to him, they make me feel physically ill and my insides hurt and i can feel my heart beat in every part of my body. all i do is ache. im scared im going to become so embedded in my own brain and thoughts that i will make him feel bad too and i don't want to hurt him. i cant figure out whether i should leave and risk hurting myself and him or whether i should stay and also risk hurting myself and him. theres no winning."
Am I a bad friend,3,mh4p81,2,"I suffer from depression, anxiety and bpd recently I’ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts lately and the only person that makes me feel better in any way no matter what is my best friend, i had been staying with her for a few days and then she told me I couldn’t stay there as it was too much for her to handle which I completely understand but it shook me a bit as she knows that being with her is the only way I’m going to get better because she’s all I want

We had a big fight about it and she told me she was relieved and happy when I couldn’t come over to stay which was extremely hurtful to me knowing that the one person that makes me feel happy and safe from harm was happy I couldn’t be with her 

I have reached out for support from emergency services, and specialist services nothing that will be able to help me for the next few weeks, but am I a bad friend for only wanting to be with my friend who is my FP and the fact that she isn’t willing to give me what I need to get out of this intense emotional stressful time, for me to be out of it in a week or so I had only been staying with her for 3 days and I had already felt a good impact on how I was feeling and she makes me feel like im this big bad bitch for wanting her 

And I’m not asking her to put how she’s feeling (and I know it’s not fair you don’t need to tell me that it is) put me above her for the rest of her life I’m asking for this one week that is extremely frustrating and extremely hurtful for me to feel like I have absolutely no one when I’ve put her above and beyond how I’m feeling no matter what because I know I can deal with it when she’s feeling better"
Does it feel worse before it’s gets better?,7,mh46ry,7,"I’m 25, been diagnosed since I was 19 but have definitely struggled immensely as long as I can remember. I’m starting to lose hope in my progress.   
I’ve been working really hard on getting better even though I recently lost my job and gone through a lot of trauma. I still want to get better to prove that can’t stop me. I’m also very tired of being “too much” for other people, and my emotions are absolutely debilitating over the smallest thing that other people don’t flinch at.   
So far, I’ve gotten better at controlling my behaviour and not reacting on my emotions. But I’m worried I’m just bottling it up. I don’t know where the line is. I feel like I am making myself smaller for other peoples’ comfort while still dying on the inside.   
I’m just wondering if this is normal, will the internal hell of an emotional rollercoaster get better with changed behaviour? I’m also trying so hard to challenge my thoughts but it’s extremely hard. I mostly just have to wait for it to subside but the pain is always somewhat there.   
It’s hard when your overthinking and bad thoughts have been proven to be right so many times.   

Thank you for listening."
Phone coaching,1,mh459q,3,"So I have started DBT. I’m a few weeks in, and phone coaching with your individual therapist is supposed to be included in the cost. It was very expensive to do but my individual therapist hasn’t given me a phone number. Should I ask? Is it beneficial to have this? Or is it not necessary. 
Thanks"
Why are we cursed?,3,mh3wga,1,"I feel so alone. My husband recorded me during an argument (honestly been waiting for this to happen to me) and he said I changed my answer 3 times. I have horrible communication with him and usually shut down or give simple answers. My head is just empty when I feel like I’m on the “spot” and it doesn’t mean I don’t care or want to fix the situation. 

He feels since I’ve become aware of my BPD that I use it as a crutch and have only gotten worse. Therapy has been scarce because of covid but I am in it. He called me many names and told me that he has been abused emotionally and mentally and can’t go on. He resents and hates me. His words. 

I feel so...hurt. Lost. Confused. Betrayed. I was supposed to get back to work today (had surgery) and he told me to figure it out on my own. I can’t walk or drive. I had to tell my work I won’t be coming in and to go ahead and file short term disability. He plans on leaving me - at least temporarily.

This is my partner of 13 years. Guys I don’t know what to do anymore. His friend was right. I am a broken human and I just thought he was the one who would understand me the most. Turns out he needs the love more than I do.... and I’m just falling apart at the seams. I know it’s not for him to fix. I have to fix me. But I feel like I have ruined him and will never get US back 😭"
Obsessions over random people,76,mh3n4m,7,"DAE who has social media find people who they idolize and base their own style, mannerisms and physical on for like a week and then drop them and move on...? I’ve done this with a ton of people and it never lasts over like 2 weeks. I think it contributes to my lack of identity. I also impulsive buy a lot of different clothes in these phases :/"
Was I also abusive?,1,mh35tf,3,"I’ve had a lot of terrible experience with narcissists in my life since childhood. 

I had a few instances of people I considered close, either romantically or as a close friend, abuse me. Whether it be mentally, physically or emotionally. The main factor that was common from each of these relationships were the fact that they wanted control over me. In any fashion, they’d try to have it over me and push me down to nothing. And gaslight me constantly so I would always be left questioning my sanity.

Throughout this time, I had undiagnosed BPD that was not assessed until 2018. I felt bad because I felt like I acted out in ways I didn’t expect. Getting EXTREMELY angry for being neglected on purpose, having anxiety attacks over being gaslighted constantly, having obsessive behaviors to prevent my partners from cheating on me (since they expressed interest in doing so), etc. I did EVERYTHING I could to salvage the relationships and still I was never good enough for my partners. I did what I thought was the right thing to do with good intentions and avoided being abandoned at the time.

I looked to others for romantic emotional comfort and I know that wasn’t the right thing to do at all. I never physically cheated on my partners but I always wished I could’ve left all those years and been with someone who loved me. I attached myself to strangers to try to find an escape from those abusive relationships to find any sense of validation. 

Of course now being older and under good therapy, I know those weren’t the best approaches to handle the relationships. I do my best to do the right thing day by day and be a good person.

Do these previous actions of mine make me abusive? Does this make me a narcissist? Or an abuser? 


And if so, how can I come to terms with this and move on?"
DAE have bpd and also a parent with bpd?,3,mh314f,5,"My mom isn’t diagnosed and probably never will be. I was diagnosed in September and as I’ve learned and researched bpd I notice that my mom also has a lot of borderline traits. 

If you do also have a parent with bpd, if you’re comfortable answering, what is your relationship like? My relationship with my mom is very rocky. We are just starting to speak to each other again for the first time since October."
Splitting for the other party,3,mh2nlk,7,"Is splitting something that can reversed? My partner who has BPD has gone from a loving boyfriend to a stranger in the space of 2 hours. We live together most of the week, and he stores a lot of things and clothes at my place. I came home from work today to find them all gone, and everything I’ve ever given him in a neat little pile. He won’t return my messages or answer my calls. I’ve asked his family to call and check in with him, as I know he has a history of self harm, and they say he’s ok. He has a child who he loves so I think he’ll avoid hurting himself for that reason.
We were planning a future together. Things have been hard lately, for a few reasons, but we had an initial appointment tomorrow with a relationship counsellor. I don’t know what to do.  If I had some hope that he might just wake up one morning and not see me as an enemy, I think I could bear it. Does anyone have any advice? I love him."
DAE get physical sensations or feelings they just can't put into words?,8,mh2ilm,4,"Hey. 

I'm hoping there's someone else out there that feels like this because I find it really troubling. I first felt really anxious/bad when I was like 9/10. I distinctly remember the feeling 9f everything just all of a sudden feeling sad whilst I was out with my friends. I still can't put my finger on it, but it was like a physical and emotional shift and once it started I didn't know how to stop it. 

The feeling kept happening every year around a similar time (summer) or triggered by similar smells, sights etc. I noticed that I always felt this weird feeling and then I felt it again after I was sexually assaulted at 13, and again after an abusive relationship at 16. It's so difficult to describe but one day I just wake up in the summer and feel physically different, it's definitely a bad sensation. I'm now 24 and I just don't really know how to describe it to my therapist or anything. 

Sorry if reading this was absolute nonsense but I woke up feeling like this again today (it's sunny and the air smells like when I was a teenager), all I want to do is cry because I feel like it's coming back again. But I can't because I just feel so numb and strange. I'm sure I sound crazy, but I just feel like I'm shutting down."
i dont know what to do anymore (tw suicide),10,mh2his,6,"all i do in life is run away and burn bridges. Nothing ever felt truly mine, or worth having. I got so close to happiness for the first time in my life, as in, about to have everything I’ve ever wanted, but it all went south again. People closest to me dont believe in me anymore. The only person ive ever loved chose someone else after letting me believe otherwise. I remember wanting to die when i was not yet on medication - it was peaceful. Now i can actually feel the pain i will cause others by dying while also feeling my own shitty pain all the time. I dont believe i can handle being alive in the long term. How do you go on when life has proven time and time again that no matter what i do i will always end up at the same empty place again?"
Self destruction,5,mh28tx,3,"I have managed to wreck my life... And all because of undiagnosed, unmanaged BPD. I've been diagnosed with CPTSD in the past, and possibly bipolar. But I know bpd - my mother was a definite diagnosed NPD /BPD - and I tick all the boxes for the Quiet version. Only came to this realisation two months ago.

I had a massive nervous breakdown last year, and over the next few months saw it all so clearly. A lifetime of projections, blaming others, mirroring and unfair anger. My poor ex husband, who tried so hard with me, but in the end I caused so much damage, and ended it... And hurt him. The weight of my regret is insane. I miss him, his real warm kindness, the security I had with him, the safety and laughter... And even in this, I realise that I miss him - to a large extent - for what he gave me. And him too, as a person.

The weight of THAT selfishness is killing me. But it's real. I can't avoid it. I see it so clearly.

I'm deeply depressed. Having fucked up my career too, overestimating my capabilities and intelligence. 

The clarity and depression of this vision is horrendous. It burned out the emotions out of me, I can't cry anymore. 

I see my selfishness. Self obsession. Unmanaged emotions. Anxiety, dear, depression. Mirroring and emptiness inside. What is seen cannot be unseen... I am a hollow shell, and I feel like a liar. Always. Because I'm not genuine deep down. Not sharing myself. Because I'm disgusted and ashamed of what I am inside. I can't show that to people.

But that part of me is the real me. The inner child that was burned by trauma. I can't find the love for it, I can't love, laugh or cry anymore. That child feels dead.

I'm deeply suicidal. Selfish again. I know. But I just can't face my future with this knowledge... Just a body walking around, people thinking I'm nice but actually they are just seeing a reflection of their own goodness in me. I'm a fantastic mirror. But it hurts so bad. I'll NEVER have a free, full, genuine life they they do... It takes a massive effort of will to stop the envy, the despair. The despondency. 

Makes me sound like a victim. And yes, I am - massive victim mentality. To take the responsibility would be to stand up, and keep going through life helping &amp; giving others - even though I'm a hollow shell on the inside. However much it hurts. Other people see their reflection in me, and think I'm lovely... But they go home to families and I - to another night of pain, KNOWING that I reflected their goodness, it wasn't mine to give.

I don't know if I can do that. The pain is driving me crazy. The stress I'm under has wrecked my sleep, my personality and everything else.

I can't live like an empty mirror. It hurts. SO much. Is it my punishment for not taking responsibility earlier, when my life could still be fixed and healed?

I won't have the money for DBT now. I am a single woman, and my employment prospects are very poor (another story...) I've done a great job self destructing. 

Not long now until I have the courage to end it. After all that, I'm selfish and afraid of dying. The body wants to live."
I dont know whats wrong with me,8,mh1brw,4,I don’t really know what flair to put this under cause honestly its a mixture of everything. I’ve been having crazy intrusive thoughts lately of really disturbing things and it’s been affecting me whenever im out in public especially. Another thing is that I’ve been feeling so...detached from myself? I can’t explain the feeling anymore. Its like im aware of whats going on but at the same time im not. It happens at the most random times of the day and its the most strangest feeling ever. I honestly might just be crazy. i also just want to isolate myself from everybody so bad because of these things. i just want to sleep and never wake up
can i believe my instincts?,2,mh185v,0,"friend and i were having few beers yesterday and after a while an aquaintance of ours showed up and he invited her over. soon her friend we dont know joined. it was cool. i was already tipsy. my friend had to go soon, but i stayed to finish my beer, and girl said shell make me company. it was cllosing time, so i soon drank it and we all got up to go. on the way out i said bye, but the girl i know was talking to someone else and didnt  pay attention, but other girl i just met hugged me.  
on my way home i was so disturbed and embarrased bc i felt like they didnt want to keep me company and i was burden and went offt he rails with destructive thoughts.   


i always trusted my instincts. when i felt a bit unwanted i would just go away forever, but lately i think my instincts are not correct hahah  
(im not in any kind of therapy atm, tho i put myself on waiting lists)"
Things are just weird,2,mh17ad,0,Idk man I’m in college and I’ve just been just totally fucking out of it recently. I feel so sad that I just abandon relationships. Fell hard for a girl but she’s taken and I still want to be friends with her but I don’t know how fuck me man. Things are so complex and complicated. I wish things were simpler.
DAE get sudden burst of energy or the need to be productive and do any work after a depressive episode?,44,mh15jk,6,"I recently had a depressive episode for weeks where i would sleep till noon, wake up, feel like shit, avoid everyone, and ignore calls and texts and would delay assignments till the end. but since 2 days i’m feeling better and now i have all this energy where i feel like i have to do some work. i submitted all my assignments but i want more just so i can do something or i will go crazy. i’m socializing and finding things to do like clean my room and stuff. i would like to know your opinions on this."
Sociopathic traits alongside BPD,9,mh102h,3,"Can one have full blown BPD and traits of sociopathy? 
I feel no guilt or remorse- yet i can feel anxious about made up scenarios. 
I feel no empathy- unless its self pity. I can definitely get emotional about being suicidal but thats as far as it goes. 
I dont think im narcissistic because i have a very low/no self esteem. 
I know how to be and when to be charming. 
I do lie to get my way. 
I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, although never been diagnosed with ocd. I am interested however how it would feel to act on those thoughts. Id often get them while talking to anyone and there would be this accompanying feeling of: you only survived this encounter with me because i let you to. 
The only thing keeping me in my rails is simply fear of legal consequences."
Introducing Me,5,mh0xmw,3,"I feel empty, out of control, powerless and angry a lot of the time I have mood swings. I have no real sense of self. I am emotionally driven. Other people are often frustrated and angry towards me but i don't understand why.

I fear abandonment, rejection, betrayal and domination by others. I am needy.

I have a history of unstable or abusive relationships. Sometimes i sell harm or or have suicidal thoughts, l make threats and behave badly. I am impulsive (binge eating reckless driving sex spending, substance misuse) lfeel guilty.

I have brief paranoid ideas or severe dissociative symptoms related to stress, l experience repeated crisis in my life.

Things I might believe about myself as all over the place. Iam bad, I am unlovable, I do not fit in, l am different, I cannot cope alone, I need someone to rely on, I deserve to be punished, nobody understands me.

It may be hard for you to believe, but living with this sickness is far more difficult then the pain it brings to you from my hurtful words. For you- you can escape. You can walk away from me at any moment. I am left there in my mind, left in this confusion I call my life. Introducing Me."
Begging my therapist to not terminate me,2,mh0xfi,1,"I had an incident with my therapist which I posted on this subreddit regarding her breaking confidentiality to my mother. I got angry and wrote an email saying I’ll see her one last time and go and see someone else (this new person has then expressed that I’m “too complex” for her to take on and now I’m left with no one) as she has broken my trust. I also made a complaint to the clinic about her. The clinic called me on Monday and said they were cancelling all my appointments with her and that I could not even see her one last time. After many times calling the clinic in tears they agreed for me to have a final session with my therapist but said she cannot offer ongoing sessions.

I’m really regretting what I have done. I have been seeing my therapist once a week for four years and to see all that go down the drain is heartbreaking. I really want to rekindle things and keep working with her. I have been feeling extremely depressed, barely eating, self harming and crying and calling helplines every day.

I have written her a letter I will give you to her in the final session (ai am no longer allowed to email her).

“Dear X,
I just wanted to write you a letter explaining the situation. I felt like we were reaching an impasse in our therapy so I reached out to another psychologist for advice. She said to work things out with you before switching over. My initial plan was to give us a few more sessions to work things out then see. However, I felt you forcing me to call my mother broke all my trust in you and I got angry and emailed you saying that I was going to see someone else. It turns out anyway this psychologist will not see me after all as my presentation in “too complex.” 

I really do regret sending you this email and I feel like I’ve jumped the gun too soon, which I tend to do with my bpd. It was a stupid and rude thing to do and I wholeheartedly apologise. The prospect of losing you has really put things into perspective for me. Even though we’re not friends and we’re not related, you’re one on the most important people in my life and I can’t picture not having you in it. These past few days have been filled with sadness and a lot of tears. I’m absolutely heartbroken.

We have made so much progress together and I think it would be extremely detrimental to my mental health if we were to cease therapy so abruptly. I really do want to continue working with you. I’ve been seeing you once a week for four years. Something like that shouldn’t be ruined based on a misunderstanding.

I am pleading you to give me a second chance. I really value our therapy more than anything. There are changes we can make to make this work such as: an updated safety plan and agreement, no email contact, permission to contact my mother if I am in danger and more.

Please work in with me to help make this work. I want to keep working with you more than anything. You have helped me grow so much and I don’t know where i wouldn’t be without you”

How does that sound. Is there anything I can add or change or do you just think it’s a hopeless cause?"
Maybe I can help?,4,mh0wvh,0,"Hi. I'm a long time BPD specimen. I just found this sub and I'm excited to read all the stories and try to support everyone.

Advise on helping my mom,1,mh0qzv,1,"My mom is undiagnosed BP. She has all the symptoms and hits almost all the DSM markers. She and my uncle suffered extreme physical abuse at the hands of my grandfather while her sister was the golden child.
I am not here to berate, belittle or argue. We each have our own space in reddit and I respect this. I am here to ask a question and seek help.
I think my mom would benefit greatly from therapy. She has massive and sometine crippling anxiety. She sabotages relationships and even some of my grandchildren don't want to see her. She's my mom and this pains me so much. Is there a way I can convince her to at least try to see someone? I've tried to raise the subject with her but she says that there is nothing wrong with her so why would she go? She also regards psychology as a bogus profession. I'd like a strategy but don't want to be manipulative about it. I also want to stress that I'm not looking to ""cure"" or ""fix"" her. I just think she would be happier if she saw a therapist.
Thank you for your time reading this."
BPD has sabotaged all my relationships,6,mh0itd,1,"My gf and I broke up cause I’m so unstable, she admitted that she’s scared to be honest with her feelings cause she’s scared to overwhelm me and I’m always scared of her not being honest with her feelings. I also ruin things she was the last person in my life I can’t do this anymore I’m trapped in this cycle man. I begged for her not to leave like a baby I was so weak man."
Thinking every person you fall in love with is “the one”?,37,mgzxuj,10,"It’s kind of embarrassing, but I’m like this. If there’s any connection, I think it’s the best one. When the relationship inevitably ends, I think my life is worthless now that they’re gone, and that they were my only shot at true love/my soulmate. Until the next relationship. I’m so stupid."
Unstable relationships are still better than none,26,mgzq67,10,"As of right now I'm crushed by the fact I have no one around me. No friend to casually talk to, about my life or theirs. I barely see my parents because they equal negative feelings and just breakdowns over the same things. My only casual human interaction at this point is putting up a couple posts about my interests and live of the few interactions I get like a starved man planning how to split this one can of food over a month. 

I've seen plenty people on here talk about how being alone has significantly helped them but, as much as I myself prefer to keep my circle small, no circle at all is just downright depressing. At leats along with the sad, you have the happy sometimes. I'm almost always suicidal and it's only a matter of time before one of breakdowns gets bad to the point I end up doing it. Then I'll die with no one having cared for me. My funeral would be just the people who made me this way and traumatized me to the point of no function. 

When I post this, no one will reply. Call this wallowing in my own pity, but I'm not exactly wrong. No one in real life will acknowledge my existence anymore, but the countless times of being ignored online where I've just sought for aid with the same chances as any other stranger on here is another kind of soul crushing. I basically don't exist anymore. If this were a game, I'm a plain NPC with no voice lines or interactions, that's all."
episodes with FP out of control,3,mgzpge,1,"everything they say cuts deep and it’s all true but hearing it at my low points starts my suicidal spiral, which in turn makes them more upset, which makes me more upset, which makes them more upset, which makes me literally lose my goddamn mind on the floor screaming under my breath, which makes them more upset, so on and so forth. 

i fucking hate my fucking self so much i don’t know what to do how do i stop this cycle i try so hard but i always fucking fail, they don’t deserve to have to deal with my garbage, please please help"
Does anyone else self isolate in the most extreme ways when one small thing upsets you?,58,mgzk91,17,"The other day I was watching a show with my fp and in between episodes I started just spilling to him EVERYTHING I going on in my mind currently. It was a lot. It was so so much. I would apologize after every message and most of them were 100+ words. He's nt and had no real idea what to do with me, but that's an issue I've always had with people, they have no clue how to help. I start to spiral and think about how no one can help me and started looking at articles to find out how to deal with myself but every article turned out to be a ""How to deal with a loved one with BPD""

This sent me over the edge. I have to be dealt with? My entire life? I will be a constant burden to people and always be a nuisance? What the hell? I then became overcome with despair thinking about how people who love me will have to go out of their way to have a good relationship with me, and their mental health will still get weakened from having to constantly reassure me and take my random accusations of paranoia. I couldn't take the thought of being people's burden and how I must hurt people's mental health. 

I am now completely isolated. I logged out and deleted all social media, told my fp I'm leaving and will be back once I'm better, muted all my friends, and leave my phone in my room. I'm constantly watching shows now and finding things to distract me from the moments I would have rather been talking to people. Please tell me people do this as well. Random isolation. Complete isolation. Why do I do this so often. Why do I get riddled with guilt randomly and make such drastic actions?"
What does BPD + BD look like?,0,mgze6g,2,"What does BPD look like in a person who also is diagnosed with Bipolar disorder (1 or 2)?

How does BPD interact with BD? How is DBT adjusted to address the BD, or are there a combination of therapies?

I haven’t yet understood how these two disorders coexist. I would love to understand, to see what life is like through this lens and how therapy helps manage and improve the outlook for individuals with both disorders.

Curious to hear your input and experiences so please share!!"
Favorite Person Question?,1,mgz54k,0,"Hello all! I (21F) am not diagnosed bpd, however I do share a lot of symptoms and am working towards finding a diagnosis that fits me. I’m very new to this and I’m still working on researching the things I’m experiencing, so forgive me if I get some things wrong. 

One thing I have always related to with bpd is the idea of a favorite person. I often tend to tie myself to a person and my entire self worth and feelings depend on them. That connection happens hard and fast and feels obsessive and out of control at times. It happens most often with internet friends and has happened recently in a way that is a lot more intense than I’ve ever experienced, and I’m looking for advice on the situation but I feel judged by my therapist when the topic comes up and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her about it.

In the past year I met someone playing dnd who I quickly connected with, we became very close friends and it very, very quickly got into the territory of unhealthy dependence on them. I was constantly looking for their validation and attention, I hurt other relationships to keep that one working, and everything I felt was completely out of proportion when it came to them. A month or two ago I hit a very hard depressive episode and suddenly felt completely unconnected from them. I no longer need their validation or attention, it is a complete change that seemingly happened over night with no trigger, I have absolutely no clue what happened. I went from one emotional high to a low with no warning, and it seems to have really hurt our relationship.

He’s a great guy, but I think both of us are a little confused and unsure of how to proceed in a less codependent way. I want to be his friend but I don’t want to go back to him being the center of my world because it felt so obsessive. How can I get back to having this guy be my friend in a healthy and natural way? Anyone have experiences like this and can offer any guidance?

Again, sorry if I’m posting this in the wrong place or badly characterizing bpd, I’m working off of research and some therapy and I’m just not sure what I’m experiencing quite yet, but I know this is a fp issue and I’m hoping to get some advice about how to work on that relationship in a healthy way. Thoughts?"
"""Why do I fall in love with everyone that shows even the slightest interest in me?""",73,mgz0ft,22,"""Why do I fall in love with everyone that shows even the slightest interest in me?""

This is somewhat common with BPD. The reason it happens is that humans have a certain minimum level of personal relationship that they desperately crave. BPD people are usually well below that minimum, due to their tendency to wreck most relationships ( romantic or otherwise)

Thus, a BPD individual is literally starving for a relationship, even if they know it is likely going to fall apart eventually. So when they get even the *start* of a relationship, its like oats for a starving person -- might not be tasty, but they are desperate for the food, and might even eat it raw.

So as soon as the relationship shows the tiniest bit of promise, well thats like cake, and a BPD will desperately pounce on that, and devour it in seconds.  

The best advice I can give is get into low-stakes, non-sexual relationships (aka friendships).  It will get you used to humans and talking, and not being quite as relationship starved.  Then work your way up to the more serious sort of relationship.  Hopefully you will have gained some experience and skills (but nothing compares to DBT, please give it a try, even if it's just reading the books).  
Don't expect this to be magic; the point of it is just going to dull the euphoria of ""OMG human interest"" a little so that you stay slightly more calm and sane.

I’m so tired of BPD.,14,mgyp5r,6,"TW: SH/suicide

My boyfriend broke up with me because he could not deal with my episodes anymore and I don’t blame him. He was my last bit of support and he said he didn’t want to be responsible for someone else’s life because I am so suicidal. 

I went undiagnosed for years so I’m barely receiving treatment. I don’t know how to deal with BPD. I don’t know how to fix myself. I’ve sabotaged every good thing in my life. My boyfriend was my best friend and I lost him because I couldn’t fix myself in time. 

I’m tired of worrying if my feelings are real or not. I don’t know when I’m being dramatic anymore and even when I catch myself blowing things out of proportion it’s like once I’m in that episode I just can’t stop and nothing can calm me down. I’m so tired of not being able to control my SH or my suicidal thoughts. I’m tired of everything I say coming off as manipulative when I’m just trying to express what I’m feeling. I feel so out of control and alone. I’ve been trying for years to better myself and this breakup just pushed me down so hard. I wish I knew how to explain what I’m feeling because I feel like no one understands. 

I don’t feel deserving of love anymore, I don’t feel like I actually deserve anything good in my life. My feelings are so excruciating and they are usually always over something so minor. I feel like such a burden to anybody in my life. I wish I didn’t have BPD and I wish I could fix myself. I feel so hopeless now. I resent myself so much for not being able to fix myself. I’ve caused so much trouble in other people’s lives because I can’t get it together. I’m trying my best and it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. I just wish I didn’t exist at this point."
BPD and Bipolar,1,mgy8ze,1,"I read a lot about them, and even attended a conference today, but I’m still uncertain about their differences... especially with type 2 bipolar disorder.

How do you get over an ex fp?,1,mgwz5p,0,"TW: mentioned alcohol and sex 

Its been nearly a year since my last relationship ended. I was completely head over heels in love with someone for probably the first time in my life. Life was completely perfect and sadness seemed like a thing of the past. I knew things were too good to be true and could almost sense something wrong was about to happen. 

And then everything changed while I was sleeping one night. I couldn't believe how at one moment I looked my fp in the eye and we had such a sincere ""I love you"" moment, and the next morning I woke up to find out I had been cheated on. 

My mind kept telling me that somehow it was my fault. I still decided to stay in that relationship, begging my fp to not leave me. I caught them cheating on me 5 more times after that. Still I believed that somehow they are too good for me and I deserve this. I never had the courage to breakup. One afternoon I saw I was blocked on all socials and my fp had left me for the person they were cheating on me with. 

Its been a year and my mind tells me that ""you split on them. Its this freaking black and white thinking. You deserve to die alone"". I have drank beyond imagination in this last year. I have cried every single night before bed in this last year. I have gained 20 lbs and hate myself more than ever. I haven't done anything since I graduated. I have sexted with more random strangers than I can count. I have never been more desperate for a relationship in my life but I just am scared to get hurt again. 

I feel like this was one breakup I'll never get over and I will just die alone. I can't keep going on like this"
Negativity doesn't change the situation,2,mgwdzq,1,"Okay, so I know that others come on here to vent during their struggles especially in those moments that it feels helpless. It always just really saddens me seeing people say they think bpd is a curse and they wont ever get better. Now, I have felt those ways before so I am not passing any judgement but I am also a firm believer that if you want things to get better you have to work for it. I am stuck in this limbo right now of waiting on getting into a DBT program and stuck with an uniformed therapist on bpd. Now me a few years ago would have thought this was pointless and this is ""proof"" that nothing will get better. I still am really struggling with those constant suicidal thoughts and outburts but I am finding those patterns where before I didn't. To get to this point of acceptance with little help has been hard but I have done my best with what I have. Bought several workbooks, watched Dr Fox videos on youtube, and communicated to my loved ones what things trigger me. Obviously I can not fully heal on my own but I do think there are things that we can do to help ourselves and staying stuck in that negative mindset only feeds in to this disorder. I am not sure if what I am saying makes sense but basically my point is that you have to work hard to get better and it sucks I understand, trust me  I understand, but it is not impossible. There is a reason that a therapy was created just for people with bpd. We can live happy and normal lives and yes it is different than those with out but that does not mean that is a bad thing. I just really get hurt seeing others share on here that they feel like it never ends. Challenge your own thoughts, educate yourself on what to do, and you will get  better."
how did you tell your s/o about your BPD?,5,mgw63s,10,"I’ve been posting here about my *chaotic* love life over the past few weeks.

I told my last partner abt my diagnosis over text, and I feel like I regret that. But maybe it’s the best way to do it. Maybe I send him some literature and we chat about it tomorrow IRL.

I’m a piece of shit and just genuinely want to hurt myself all the time because of it, I deserve it, I miss her so much and knowing I’ll never get to speak to her again hurts so much.

How do I...idk, not ""channel"" my crisis feelings into therapy, but even report them accurately? I sometimes can't even remember the depth of what I'm feeling after an episode, or what triggered it. How do I bring more of the things I REALLY need help with into a session? I've been trying to write out more in advance or while I'm having an episode, but sometimes I'm too emotional/out of control to even do that.

Also, today had a bit of a therapy breakthrough that I haven't had the time or space to properly process yet (had a family member in town staying with me and then had to go straight to work). Had a proper breakdown immediately after I was left alone and am struggling to keep it together at work now. This is the first time this has happened to me and idk what to do. How can I prepare for something like this in advance next time?"
How go get diagnosed w/o good insurance,1,mgv9z7,0,"I post here a lot because I am pretty certain I have BPD, this isn't just based off self diagnosis, I've been told I have BPD traits by a psychiatrist. 

I really want to get officially diagnosed because I think it would just really validate my issues and I wouldn't feel like I'm just making it all up in my head. 

The problem is I do not have insurance, or rather, I have crappy public health insurance and can only see a select few mental health professionals and none of them are psychiatrists or specialize in personality disorders. They only offer psych evals ADHD and anxiety and depression. I've been treated for all three for almost 7 years and my life is still in a constant fucking downward spiral because none of these treatments have helped with my emotional instability and self destructive behavior. I'm so sick of the lack of resources for people with anyone but anxiety and depression. It's like everyone is willing to help and listen when it comes to those issues but anything else and you're on your own."
DAE constantly repeat this cycle,75,mgv38r,10,"
It goes like this 

1. Symptoms aren't too bad, I am quite functional despite feeling a low level of mental pain all of the time. During this time I am sometimes convinced that I never actually had BPD or that I am cured. 


2. Symptoms get triggered, usually by a relationship issue. I am now barely functional, constantly in a great amount of emotional and mental pain. I get very self destructive, start using a lot of drugs, starting fights with my FP. Crying pretty much every day. Increasingly suicidal


3. Decide to go to therapy because I can no longer live like this anymore. Symptoms start to improve again and I feel stable. 



4. Drop out of therapy because I feel better, am too distracted by my busy life and would rather invest my time in other endeavors. 

Rinse and repeat. I hate myself."
I can't stop ruminating over things said by my FP/SO during a fight,7,mgugkz,2,"We were fighting a lot last week, a lot of mean things were said on his part. We've made up since but honestly I feel like the things he said just destroyed me. Now I'm constantly worried that I'm making him mad when I'm around him and I feel fucking pathetic for caring so much in the first place. 

When I'm alone all I can think about is all of the flaws he pointed out. That I'm the saddest most depressing person to be around. That my issues are too much. He has more fun with the girls at work than with me. I have no friends and no interests and that makes me boring. 

I hate myself for loving him so much and I hate the way he sees me because of it. I feel like the only way he could love me is if I just ignored him and did whatever the fuck I wanted, maybe then he could see my value but probably not because nothing will change the fact that I'm fucking worthless and pathetic. I'm an empty, sad person, no depth just anger, sadness, and eagerness to please. I'm not a real person just a mirror for the people I love. 

I feel so broken, I just want to hide away and never speak to anyone again. If I had my own apartment I would just leave and cut everyone off so I didn't have to feel the weight of everyone's disappointment in me. 

I can't stand myself, I am in constant pain and suffering and all I have is love, drugs, and other dopamine rushes to anchor myself from one moment to next so I don't go insane or kill myself."
Need help with BPD essay.,5,mguc9d,1,"Hey guys! Bit of a weird question here, but I have a 10 page paper due for one of my classes as a final. It has to be a research essay about anything we’d like. I’d really like to write about BPD as I already know a lot about it and it’s very interesting to me (cuz I have it lol). I’m having a hard time developing a good thesis statement/argument to center my essay around though. Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
Do you ever feel like part of BPD is loving being mentally ill/“crazy”?,6,mguafj,3,"I always loved to feel like I was “crazy” as a kid. I made EFFORTS to be “crazy” and weird. Even now, 12 years into BPD treatment, I still get these feelings of like...I could be so crazy if I wanted to. I could go off the rails. And it feels so good to know that I have that inside me- which makes no sense because I love my life and my healing has given me what my illness never could. I am so happy and healthy. But every once in a while I feel like...I could be so dark. I could be like Harley Quinn. 

And to that end, I think a LOT of people with BPD (in this sub included) love to wallow. They love to feel like they’ll never get better. They love to self harm. They love to tell other people it’s normal and ok to use self harm as a coping mechanism. They keep repeating the lie that BPD is incurable. It just seems to me like some pwBPD find joy and pleasure in feeling like they’re “fucked up”. It makes me so sad. And yet...it’s such a familiar feeling."
I am wasting all my energy on someone who's not giving me any of theirs,1,mgu1xu,1,"End of December I met this guy when I was at a really low point, we started 'seeing each other' and we would hang out a lot, the thing is he would always say he felt like I was just wanting to hang with him cause I was bored even though he was never making any plans with me I can actually recall only one time he arranged for us to hang. Anyways a few weeks ago we were only ever meeting up to fuck, I had a melt down, he met someone else and now we're just kinda a friends with benefits situation, but the thing is we never hang out anymore. He tells me that he enjoys our friendship and hanging out with me but I keep trying to arrange for us to meet up and he straight up just leaves me on seen. I asked him if he's busy today and he said yes, which fair enough he might be, I've asked what about tonight and if he just ignores me again I'm gonna stop talking to him until he can hit me up. I just need friends at the moment I get stuck in my house cause I have no money and transport, I'm starting a job next week which will give me something to do but I really don't understand what this guy wants. The last time we actually properly hung out was nearly 6 weeks ago and I really enjoy his company we get up to some fun shit."
I fear judgement and it all stems from the abuse I have experienced from my parents,5,mgtqjg,1,"I'm sitting here wondering if posting this is a good idea, nobody in my family knows about me having a reddit account so but I still fear them finding it. I'm sitting in my room tonight by myself and today is my step sisters birthday. My dad and step mom (who is so shitty to me) took my step sister out for her birthday, didn't even invite me, after letting her travel around some states and having a beach trip. I never was offered that and I'm his blood. he is taking shots with her, hes never done that with me. He wouldn't drink with me. most of the times when we would in public he would ask did I need to eat that, why wont I look at the salads. Yeah I put on a lot of weight I wont lie, the thing is I did not get to choose what major I did because he was paying for my college degree so I was miserable and starting smoking pot then eating to feel good. I haven't smoked weed in a long time and im trying to fight my weight due to my liver started having issues. I just cried and feel like shit. I was just raised so differently than she was because she is the favorite because shes hot basically.  I remember that I wanted a nose ring and when I asked he told me if I did that he would rip the nose ring out of my nose, she just randomly went and got one and everything was fine. This has happen many of times. I love her but shes such a shitty person overall and its her mothers fault because she allowed her to do whatever she wanted because my dad wouldn't let me. It's such a long painful ass story but trust me it was done on purpose. I'm not perfect, not even close but I have never done what she has done to people and yet everything is okay when she does it. makes no fucking sense at all. The only enjoyment I have is knowing my dad is fucking the secretary at work and my step mom does not know. It's so funny because she's the dirty whore my dad was fucking when he was with my mom. Thanks for reading I guess."
How do you be “one of the boys?”,1,mgtnnz,1,"( i’m a sophomore in community college. I’m transferring to a university soon and don’t want to limit my friend options. ) My other gay friends can code switch super fast, but I’ve never been good at it. I used to have some straight friends (they moved away) but whenever they would introduce me to their other friends it would always fizzle out or they’d ignore me. They didn’t really have an interest in anything I said or getting to know me, but always claimed after that they thought I was cold or standoffish. This always makes an episode of obsession on how straight dudes act around each other which never helps. 

Girls and gays tell me i’m personable and (lol) charming so i’m not sure where the disconnect is with straight men. whenever i attempt to fit in its very obvious i’m just mimicking them and they also call me out as being a wanna be or “burnt”. I still have singular straight friends but put me in a group with them and I just freeze up since I never seem to win them over and maybe that’s my issue. 

Seeing dudes interact so easily and being funny, interesting, quirky etc without any effort makes me upset since it’s so hard for me. Can anyone relate? Any coping skills to not freeze and try too hard?"
Waking up in *an episode*?,39,mgtn3v,11,"Do you ever wake up and you all your bpd symptoms are so overwhelmingly there? Like if anyone was around me right now I know little things would just drive me insane. The fact that I am alone though is causing an overwhelming emptiness. My SO has already left for work and I am trying everything in my power not to believe that they hate me but my brain is choosing chaos this morning. I feel like I’m nothing, like what’s the point in even getting out of bed? I feel like I won’t be a real person until my SO gets home."
How to create understanding of my illness without seeming like I blame bad behavior on it,7,mgtjtb,2,"I’d like to figure out how to have a conversation with my SO about BPD and what it does/is, to help him understand a little better. I don’t want to come across like I blame any bad behavior on my illness though. I know I’m responsible for my own actions in the end. 

Any advice is appreciated."
Is anyone else very protective of their possessions or area they have?,59,mgtce8,19,"I feel like the things I own are very important to me and I very much dislike someone moving these things. I have a specific place I put each of my things and routine sometimes for example, I keep my wallet, keys, phone in one area that I place them when I get home, if anyone is to move them or use them without my permission my mind gets frantic and usually leads to angry outbursts shamefully. I feel like I have had this issue as far back as I can remember, but now I have children and I cannot have ""my own area"" or always place my things systematically, it's not fun, it leads to a great deal of stress. I really need my own ""safe space"" if you will, just an area that I know will not be disturbed and I can change to my will, I feel so petty asking my wife to not touch certain things of mine, it just causes a lot of distress and I wish it wasn't the case, she does not understand where I'm coming from though on the issue. Thanks for listening everyone.

Edit: someone in the comments mentioned it as a control thing, I really feel that's a good explanation. Maybe others will agree."
A psychiatrist validated me,11,mgstj5,1,"Earlier this year, a therapist told me she doesn’t believe that I have BPD ( I was diagnosed with it at another clinic ). Her invalidation made me feel awful and I questioned whether I really had BPD. But today I had an appointment with a psychiatrist who made me feel validated and that I wasn’t faking it like the other lady made me feel. So yay!"
Splitting from friends,3,mgsi6b,0,"Ive been splitting from my friends (BPD term that essentially means my brain wants to cut them off cuz why tf not) IDK wat to do aside from just avoid them and wait it out, the thing is I live with them so I am mostly just isolating and withering away cuz im too scared im gonna shout at them to shut the fuck up. Mostly ive just been getting increaingly agitated/ annoyed with them and like little stupid things that I feel like shouldn't matter but do, IDK how to effectively communicate that I need them to not interact with me right now cuz i hate their fucking guts, but like cute and wholesomely. I was also never taught how to set boundaries or communicate effectively and that is abundantly clear rn. Any advice or tips I apprreciate especially surrounding setting boundaries/ communicating how im feeling effectively. I also dont want to just say im not doing well and its not their fault and to ignore me because part of me feels like it is their fault/ I need to set a boundary that isnt dismissive of my own feelings."
For People Who Pick At Their Skin (Potential Solution),18,mgsfbz,7,"Hey there, so I have struggled with compulsive skin picking my entire life. I have tried a number of ways to stop myself, including gloves and clipping my nails extremely short. However, I think I have finally found a solution!

I decided to get a set of acrylic nails done just for cosmetic reasons. I love the way they look, and it's been part of my new self-care. As a very positive side-effect of this, the rounded edges of the nails prevent me from actually damaging my skin. Plus, I am super cautious about accidentally damaging something I spent a decent amount on.

I know this won't necessarily work for everyone. But, in case it helps even one person, I wanted to share this!"
"I'm utterly numb, dissociated and empty.",14,mgsc4d,3,"Everything feels fake, unreal, distant. I'm watching myself going through the motions but I don't feel any connection to anything at all. It's just TV static in my head."
Do you find it difficult fitting in with society?,18,mgrxbv,6,I feel like I don't belong anywhere with anyone. I'm just a lone wolf. I can't take this much longer. I do feel different but not in a superiority complex way. I'm just hurting deep down. Plus I'm part of the LGBT so I feel even more ostracized. Do you as well?
I want to make the few people left in my life hate me TW: suicide/SH,24,mgrw05,8,"So that I can kill myself guilt free. I find myself becoming more and more resentful of these few people because I live only for their benefit, to spare them from the pain of hearing I'd died; of ""mourning"" someone who was never real, never really here, never a person, just a nonentity in tremendous mental pain every moment of every day. I'm almost 30 with nothing but regrets and scars to show for it, looking at my future is already like staring down the barrel of a shotgun, except the slug is in slow motion and will take decades more to reach my face. I keep having flashes of myself as an old man, dying slowly on cold bathroom tiles after a fall, with no one there to help me. That's the best I can hope for."
anyone have negative reactions to weed?,24,mgrmq8,13,i smoke it every night but sometimes it just amplifies my bpd symptoms and i feel worse. does anyone else ever get this way? i overthink to the extreme and its always about my fp. every emotion is like its on steroids.
Frustration with having an attachment disorder as an adult.,8,mgrdtz,3,"My therapist has not like, officially diagnosed a particular disorder (I’m not sure there is one), but recently our sessions have been my frustrations with having an inability to attach to people. 

I mean, I’ve always been relatively friendless, even as a kid. Like I had one or two friends at a time, but I guess like, I could have fun with people sometimes, but I don’t care too much if they leave. Like I value the fact people provide distraction more than actual people. 

I don’t say that to be like “oh i hate people” or “i have no empathy”, because thats not true. I have and am capable of empathy, I have a very large capacity to care about people as a whole. But the moment we are equals I cannot attach. I can see someone as a mentor, or I can see them as someone I need to protect. But when it comes to being an equal, I cannot even maintain interest. 

My therapist and I have talked about it, and she says the only way to really combat it is to try EMDR to at least process trauma, but even then theres no guarantee I can ever form those attachment, it just depends on why the “block” is there. 

I say all this because the whole thing just makes me so fucking frustrated. Its so frustrating, because cognitively I see people doing this thing, having fun doing this thing, talking about this thing, but I cant ever fucking understand it. Like people talk about stuff about having partners and shit and its just so frustrating. Like I don’t understand why I can’t feel or understand this fucking basic human experience. 

I always knew something was missing, I guess. Like I knew I wasn’t experiencing the same thing everyone else was. I just had no idea how to explain it. So I guess like, its nice to know *why* I’ve never “gotten people”, but its frustrating that no matter how cognitively I can recognize and understand the problem, I cant fix it. Its just fucking there and it may never be here. It makes me mad that no one picked up on symptoms of RAD and emotional neglect when I was a kid. Like maybe if the therapists could have been like, “oh yeah this 10 yr old is fucking bullshitting me because she cant trust me”, maybe I could have fucking learned. 

Like how did all these therapists and doctors and teachers not realize how distrustful and sensitive and closed off I was. Why wasn’t I taken away from my home? I was a fucking kid, I didn’t know it wasn’t normal. Why was it my responsibility to know and explain there was an issue? I was a fucking kid, why did anyone trust what I was fucking saying? 

Idk, if you read this, thank you, its a mess. Just kind of word vomit till I see my therapist tomorrow. Its like, I know I can be happy despite this. Theres workarounds. Ik objectively its not the worst thing to have. Im just kinda pissed about it rn, y’know? Lol. I’ll be over it in like, 10 minutes."
Facing one's self,3,mgrcvz,5,"Over the years since being married, I have discovered things about myself that I would have ever known had I not fallen in love and taken a vow to do whatever I could to make my marriage work.  

I have done my very best.  It wasn't good enough to save what I wanted to save between my husband and I, partly my doing but also a lot of his doing as well.  It has taken me a long time to realize and TRY to accept that no matter what I could have done, there was still him with his own demons.  

I have tried to fight my own.  I have tried to heal my soul.  For him...  For me...  For us.   I wanted it bad.  Even if that meant looking at myself.  

Perhaps the change came too late, in fact I know it has.  I wish I knew then what I know now.  

This is the acceptance part I struggle with.  I have to accept it was too late.  I have to accept it wasn't all in my hands.  Sometimes, no matter what you do to change you, the circumstances remain.  You cannot change another human being.  You think that free will enables you to CHANGE your circumstances.  It's not that black and white.  You can only change you.

And during this marriage, as painful as it has been, I for once was stopped in my tracks.  This relationship has given me a gift, regardless of it's outcome.  It shown me, for the first time in 30 something years, who I was.  I have to look in the mirror and see myself.  

Do you know how hard that is? (I'm sure many of you do)  I gave up over 20 years of binge drinking.  My **ultimate** coping mechanism.  What does one do without alcohol as an escape?  I'm forced to FEEL.  I'm forced to sit with this pain, this reality every day.  I'm forced to for the VERY first time, learn another way to cope.  I'm forced to be social without getting hammered.  I'm forced to sit in my skin and not run away.  When all your vices are stripped from you, it leaves you raw and exposed.  That's where I am at now, hoping that this place I've found myself, is some sort of rebirth, being stripped bare with a chance to start anew.

Riding out emotions,5,mgr1nz,5,"I’ve been sent some modules from my local mental health team about distress tolerance and they say to ride out the strong emotions rather than fight them which is what I usually do because I don’t want to feel my strong emotions because they make me feel like I’m going to die. Here’s the problem - I’m anxious today, very anxious. I’m trying to ride it out but it just keeps going. Does anyone know how I can do this? It feels impossible and it feels like it’s never going to end. I feel sick from the anxiety and I want it to stop but I’m trying to ride it out and it’s a mess. I keep telling myself “I’m anxious and that’s okay” trying to help myself except the feeling but idk I just feel stuck and anxious and this is horrible."
How to seem more normal?,5,mgqn4x,0,Confrontation and thinking for myself and how I feel is hard. Idk how to put it into words. When I’m confronted with something I go blank or think black and white thinking and have trouble having my own thoughts. How can I give a normal response?
BPD is not cute,617,mgqeyt,50,"Having BPD means having a good day and doubting your diagnosis. It means feeling like you are a manipulative bitch no matter what you do or say. It means deciding on a drastic hair or style change to finally find yourself. It means your ""happiness"" being entirely dependent on how much attention you get from that one chosen person. It's turning something ""minor"" into something world-ending. It's turning nothing into everything and everything into nothing. It's like sitting in the passenger seat of a car and watching the driver crash into a tree without being able to do anything to stop it. It's losing the will to live over a late reply to a text. It's losing your shit over a casual response. It's constantly analysing everything you said, every gesture you made, every look, everything you didn't say, everything someone else said or didn't say, that eye contact they didn't make.

It's when asking for help feels like you're a burden. It's feeling alone and misunderstood when you're the centre of attention. It's a constant battle of questioning whether your reaction was appropriate considering the situation. It's excusing mistreatment from others, because you think you probably deserved it. It means forgiving the unforgiveable because being alone is worse. It's the constant battle between lightness and darkness, and the fear of what's to come.

It's constantly being scared of losing those you love one way or another. It's constantly asking yourself if this will be the last time they forgive you. It's the fear of those closest to you waking up one day and realising they can do much better than you. It's feeling like you are constantly duping people into liking you, because you're never quite yourself. It's hating every part of yourself, even though you don't know which of them are real. It's wanting to relieve others of your burden. It's the constant struggle of wanting to end your pain, but not hurting anyone in the process. It's the urge to cut yourself, because it feels good to feel a different kind of pain.

It's filling yourself up with goods, food or drugs to feel like you're not an empty shell and never succeeding. It's realising that every compliment or every bit of positivity gets lost immediately in that black hole inside of you. It's having an all-consuming need for re-affirmation every second of every day, because people change their minds. It's blaming every single thing that goes wrong in your life or in some else's life on yourself. It means never being relaxed because there are about 100 thoughts racing through your head at any given time. It's getting used to pain and still being overwhelmed by it every single time. It's the all-consuming wave of feeling everything and nothing."
Fp indirectly said they hated me,2,mgpiva,2,"My fp (they don't know that's what they are) was ranting today over a minor situation that occured in our friend group. They said something like ""thinking about it makes me hate everyone involved"", I was involved in this situation. For context, me and another friend accidentally messed up in a dnd session a few months ago. Even though I've apologized for it multiple times and they assured me I didn't do anything ""that bad"", I feel so awful. Hearing that just crushed me and I've been a wreck ever since. They said other things that hurt but that's what messed me up most. I'm just so exhausted over this.

I don’t want to learn to live with this illness I don’t want to live with it all together!!,33,mgp9y3,2,Having bpd is literally the worst thing that can happen to a human.

Fear of relationships,2,mgndao,0,"I seem to have always messed up any and all relationships. Be it family, friends or girlfriend. The way I am just drives everyone away. And now I am even afraid of having any relationships. Their is this girl and we use to always talk every time I would see her at her job. Now when I go to the store I will avoid her at all cost. Part of me wants to talk to her but then I start to think “does she even like me”, “I’m to fucked up for her”, “im to ugly and not good enough for her”.

I recently got out of inpatient and residential treatment a few months ago. I was there for 2 and a half months. An now I might be going back again. I kind of want to send her a message on social media, but I feel like a creep. I just do not feel worthy of talking to her. I hate myself. I also wonder if I think she likes me more than what she actually does."

"What do your breakdowns look like, and how have they changed or improved with treatment?",3,mgmemy,4,"I was recently diagnosed and am wondering what other people's breakdowns look like. For me, it starts out with crying. I then start screaming things like ""fuck you"" or ""I hate you"" or ""I hate myself"", punching walls, and eventually collapsing into a sobbing, hysterical heap on the floor and begging my partner not to go and not to break up with me. I used to cut during these breakdowns but don't anymore. I just feel such intense self-loathing and desperation, and I don't feel right/am exhausted and emotionally depleted for a few days afterwards.

I'm in therapy and am very gradually improving, but I still absolutely lose control when these breakdowns occur (usually about once or twice a month). What do yours look like and have they gotten easier to manage over time?"

I am currently feeling very overwhelmed and not sure what to do or where to turn. This is my first post here in this reddit thread, so please forgive me if I did not tag this post appropriately. 

Everything here is going to be so jumbled because I can't really keep my thought running in a straight line.

I have been seeking therapy/medication for bpd, but I cannot afford the therapy costs or prescription costs and life is getting out of control. I feel like every single day that I am just going to completely lose my fucking mind. Every day, I feel farther and farther away from reality. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been so low for the last couple of weeks that I don't know if I'm going to make it back up. Sometimes, I just feel like I might be better off to just check out. I don't know what to even do anymore. My anxiety has been so bad that I feel like I can't even step outside of my house. Every time I think about it, it feels like my chest is going to collapse. I can't hold a job anymore. I've isolated myself from everyone that I care about besides my husband. I don't have any friends or any family that I can turn to. 

I feel so bad because my husband is so loving and cares so much, but I feel so toxic. He is such a blessing to me, and I feel so bad because sometimes its like a switch flips in my head and I can't control myself. I find my self being so snappy and angry with him for absolutely no reason. This all just feels so overwhelming. I don't know anymore.

  
Sorry, anyway, I guess I'll step out now. Thanks for listening Reddit."
Finally diagnosed,7,mgm3qo,0,"All these days I was sure I either had borderline personality disorder or Bi polar disorder after 8 years of living like this,I decided to go to counseling in Jan,was helpful but yesterday I went to a psychiatrist, I am now diagnosed with borderline personality disorder with bipolar type and dysthimia. So many suicide attempts,so many friends lost,so many relationships destroyed.I am on meds but I honestly still want to die because for 8 years I’ve lived like this and my aim was to kill myself and end this pain and if I lived I don’t know what id do in life"
"Favorite person won’t text me, what do I do?",5,mgld13,2,"I’ve been talking to him for a month and a half and we’re not dating but I can say I’ve definitely fallen for him. He didn’t say anything but that he was mentally exhausted and ignoring everyone, what should I do??? I already sent him something saying that I’m looking forward to seeing him when he feels better, but aside from that I’m afraid to say anything. He won’t respond to me and it’s been two days. I’m so anxious about it and I think he’ll leave me for somebody who isn’t so insane. What should I do to calm myself???"
Online friend,2,mgky4v,1,"So I have this online friend in another state (I'm in TX, she's in HI). We've been talking for 8 months now since we met on this app called Lyf which is like a social media for mental health. We seemed to have a lot in common so we hit it off quickly. She's diagnosed and treated for bipolar. When things are good, they're really good for both of us but the problem is we always fall off the same page pretty quickly. Everything will be good and then all of a sudden things change. She made a habit early on of withdrawing from difficult conversations which hurt me and I tried to work hard to improve our communication habits but she still does it even though she says she's working on it. Like if there's something she wants to talk about she'll be active in the convo, but if I want to talk about some issues in my life she just leaves me on read and responds days later sometimes. The first couple months were really bad for my mental health because our convos and nature of them constantly triggered me  so I started to talk to her every few weeks, then a handful of messages per day, then one message per day, and I still keep getting triggered by her. She refuses to phone/video chat so I'm not sure what to do anymore to get through to her and get us on the same page and STAY there. Because when things are good, they're great, but they just turn the other way often and it's frustrating. She's not abusive at all, she's a very positive and kind person and understanding of my BPD but she's not helping with her behavior and tendencies to withdraw or not put enough effort into our interactions. What should I do?"
It's my Birthday! Turning 30 feels like a bucket of cold water. You guys get the NEED for validation right now. Can you cheer up a BPD 30 y/o woman?,16,mgkhih,16,"As the title says. Today I'm turning 30 years old and I am freaking out. I feel like I lost my twenties and a chunk of my teens to depression and anxiety, before and after I got diagnosed. BPD has taken a huge part of my life, so I am feeling old and failed today.
Any words of wisdom from fellow sufferers?"
I'm lost,1,mgkgup,0,"Like honestly, I'm really lost. I have this close friend that I've been friends with for more or less 6 years. I know she probably has feelings for me that are going on for years but I'm not sure about myself? Of course I love her but I can't decide if it's more than platonically. I'm really fond of her, she makes me feel better, I want everything the best for her and she's the most beautiful person on the world to me but... There are also moments when I feel like it has to be just platonical. So I feel like I love her romantically and don't at the same time. It kind of seems like I'm scared of it and it might be my fear of abandonment acting out in the weirdest ways but idk, it's very confusing, I don't know how to work through problems like it and they come up way too often."
DAE go back and forth about “needing” therapy? Rambles about therapy,1,mgkfgd,1,"3/30/21 

I’m not in therapy at the moment. I haven’t been for about a year. The last time I was in therapy, I went consistently for eight months, and it helped a lot, but also left quite a bit to be desired. 

I’ve been feeling more depressed lately, and I don’t really know why. Ive been doing a lot of things right (exercising, journaling, etc.) but I still feel numb and sad a lot of the time. Also, my BPD symptoms have been harder to control lately. I know that on paper those are amazingly valid reasons to seek therapy. 

But then in some moments I feel better. I don’t technically struggle with day to day aspects of living. I can make it through a day and keep myself in check enough. DAE struggle with the idea of whether or not you really need therapy? 

If I was to go back to therapy, I would have to start over with a new therapist, which is scary to me. Having to explain everything else to a new person. Make sure everything is squared away with insurance. And I don’t want to do virtual sessions, I want to actually go to a therapist’s office, which is (understandably) hard to find right now. 

Also, I don’t really know what I want to get out of therapy this time around. When I went to therapy last time, there was a long list of pressing reasons why I was seeking out therapy, but now, my brain feels like a jumble whenever I think of my therapeutic goals. Can anyone else relate? If yes, what are you doing? Are you in therapy? 

My last therapist wasn’t very good in a lot of ways (literally late to every appointment, would spend sessions derailing on things that I didn’t think were particularly important, judgmental of BPD and didn’t have much experience counseling people with it) and so I’m honestly kind of nervous to try again. 

I found a therapist on psychology today that looks like everything I need in a therapist. She’s trained in DBT and actually teaches DBT skills groups. So I know she would be a better fit for me in that way. But I just don’t know if I really need therapy and should be seeking it.  

So yea. Does anyone else struggle with black and white thinking in regards to therapy? As in, one day you know you need it and the next you don’t know? What do you do about that? Are you in therapy?"
I don't hurt myself physically when I self harm.,1,mgkb41,4,I don't like pain so I don't think I could do it. But I feel like I hurt myself by listening to songs that make my mood worse and make me sad and cry or angry. Idk if it's considered self harm but it's definitly emotional torture.
Does anyone here have an experience with DBT residential facilities?,2,mgjw09,3,"I am 21F from the UK and have had many types of therapy. Before my diagnosis I had counselling from the age of 11/12 and CBT. I then received my diagnosis of EUPD aged 18. I have tried DBT online with a therapist and have the workbooks however I feel that I just forget all the techniques etc once the session ends as it’s sort of “out of sight out of mind” . I’m at the point where I need to force myself to do the sessions and read the workbooks but because I have episodes so strong that cause me to continue to do the worst things when I’m in that mood it’s as if all my progress is erased.
I’m thinking that maybe being in some sort of residential facility will be my only option, as there I wouldn’t have the chance to give up and I’d have to complete the intense therapy in order for it to sink in. I haven’t been able to find that much information online on how to get a referral etc so if anyone has any advice or stories regarding these DBT residential facilities please could you share with me and I’d greatly appreciate it :)"
I’m at a loss in my life.,0,mgjjop,4,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADD/ADHD. The past 6 months or so I’ve been suspicious that what’s going on in my head isn’t just that. I thought I might’ve been maniac depressive or just psychotic until I stumbled across this sub. Every test I take online suggests that I have severe BPD, I know these are online tests and not and actual medical professionals, but I feel like doctors and therapists always brush off what I’m trying to say and simply blame the symptoms on what I’ve already been diagnosed with. Reading through posts on here, I relate with many of y’all, but I feel like I have trained myself to try and see things more rationally, ignored the paranoid thoughts and so on. I can’t help the feeling of distrust and I often find myself hating my own best friends because I make up these things in my head, just to learn that they don’t have any harsh feelings towards me and they think everything is fine. I really don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t fit in with society, and I like it that way. But the thoughts of suicide are with me daily. I know I won’t ever act on them, but they’re there and I hate that fact. I’ve gone through spending sprees and then felt intense guilt afterwards only to do it again the next day. It’s a viscous cycle. I’m not sure what I’m looking for in this post, but all I know is I feel a little more crazy everyday, like I’m living life all in my head."
Does anyone else sometimes feel like having borderline is like this insane mash up of all the major psychiatric disorders?,69,mgj1dr,13,"We’re going to have (or appear to have) anything from substance abuse, eating disorders of all kinds, psychosis, narcissism, lack of focus, trauma, anxiety, depression, unstable moods, anger issues, self harm, social withdrawal, strange behavior... idk did I miss anything?

It’s like we have so many issues to confront. It’s so daunting sometimes, no matter how long you’ve known you’ve had this diagnosis. It’s fine, sometimes I find it kind of interesting, like insight into all these different ways of thinking and coping but it really can be like whack a mole sometimes. It’s so hard to predict how I will want to react to a new (genuinely) traumatic experience when they do unfortunately happen. 

And clinicians even sometimes really try to be like oh maybe it’s this instead... like no b**** as it turns out psychosis, even strong sensory hallucinations, are a part of borderline... I’ve been dealing with this since I was a child unfortunately and it comes during stress both good and bad. Or I can have a full blown eating disorder and then recover almost entirely because now it’s booze and SH or I just simply don’t need that particular defense mechanism anymore. It’s really disorienting but yes it it can still all be associated with this one, very complicated, disorder.

Borderline is a crazy beast sometimes.

Just diagnosed - jealousy over best friend’s new relationship - fear of abandonment,3,mgiqc1,1,"Hi all. I’ve just been diagnosed yesterday with BPD. There’s a long waiting list for therapy and in the meantime I’ve bought a DLT book. I’m just wondering if anyone has any good advice about what to do about my situation. My best friend (M) has recently entered into a relationship with an acquaintance (M). I cannot shake the feeling of jealousy that I’m getting. I’m terrified he won’t want to hang out with just me (M) anymore, he never messages me when he’s with him, I can’t shake the fear that I’m just going to end up losing him and being the butt of their jokes. This is probably completely illogical, but it feels so real to me. I want him to support me and be close to me, especially with this new diagnosis I am obviously not well, but I am terrified of pushing him further away and him getting annoyed or feeling that I’m too clingy.
I want to stay friends with him, I don’t want to have to cut him out, but this is making me have real bad urges to self harm and I’m scared of what I’m capable of doing.
Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.
Thanks x"
"I'm the common denominator, but I still feel like I was in the right. Was I the asshole?",2,mgilww,0,"Every single one of my ""best friendships"" that was cultivated throughout middle and high school has imploded in a dramatic fashion during our college years, and I am the common denominator. My sister cruelly pointed that out to me once when she was commenting on how she still had all her best friends from grade school whereas I had no friends left. I can't deny that is true, so what is wrong with me? What did I do wrong? It seems completely obvious (to me) that I was not the one at fault in either of these events - I absolutely could have handled them *better*, by having a proper discussion with my friends instead of splitting and cutting them off, but am I wrong for thinking what they did *really was* unforgivable? Even after years of therapy and self-reflection, I still feel like I was well within reason for not believing I could ever trust these people again.

\---

Freshman year of college, I flew back to my hometown to spend my birthday weekend with my three best friends from grade school. At a party, I had a threesome with one of my friends and her friend-with-benefits. We all seemed to enjoy ourselves, and the next morning we all laughed and teased each other about it at brunch. No indication that anything was wrong.

Later that same day, we were supposed to leave for a theme park but 2/3 of the friends (including the one I had slept with the night before) didn't show up. I texted them to ask where they were and they said they were at the FWB's house. I couldn't believe that they had ditched me on my birthday when *I* had been the one to fly up to see *them,* so I said they were no longer welcome to come and our friendship was over. I never got an explanation for why they decided to ditch me.

*Unrelated to the original event but worth noting: a few months later, I begin attending the same university as the friend I slept with. We have no contact between us, but have several mutual friends. When I am out of town one weekend, she attends a party hosted by one of my roommates then breaks into my room, steals clothes, smashes a mirror, and cuts my face out of a large canvas print I had of my sister and myself. I get the university's judicial affairs office involved (after the police refused to get involved) and am granted a no-contact order against her after I provide Snapchat screenshots where she admits to being the one who had done it. She is also required to give me a money order to cover the damages. Thankfully, we make it through the rest of college without ever encountering each other again.*

\---

Senior year, the remaining friend of the original friend group has had a baby. I have had an abortion. I fly up to visit her and the baby often, which involves a 5 hour flight and then a 2 hour drive. About half of the time, she will offer to make the 2 hour drive and meet me in \[major city\] so we can spend time there, but she never follows through on this. Something always comes up that prevents her from coming to the city, which means I always have to drive out to see her (after already *flying* out to see her) For one holiday weekend, I also have plans to visit other friends so I can't drive out to \[hometown\] -- I make it clear to her that I really need her to come to the city if we're going to be able to see each other this time.

30 minutes before she's supposed to arrive, she texts and says she's not coming after all because \[baby\] is sick. Probably a lie, but I don't know for sure, so instead of calling her out I say ""I am getting really tired of you flaking on me all the time"" to which she says ""My son is sick and I need to take care of him. I'm not like you, okay? I can't just kill my child"" (in reference to my abortion)

I tell her that was an incredibly low blow and she should be ashamed of herself. She says I didn't hesitate when it came to getting my abortion so I must be fine with it and she doesn't even understand why I'm so offended. We never speak again.

\---

Over the years (I'm 28 now) my assessment of these events has shifted. I used to believe wholly that I was the innocent victim and I felt completely justified in cutting them off. But the years passed - with no new significant friendships made, mental health declining, as I have become more uncertain of myself, more emotional, and more prone to overreaction - I have started to doubt that initial assessment.

You brighten up a room when you enter it and those that matter will do what it takes to be understanding of your struggles.

I want to start working on this now before I fall into this rabbit hole a 3rd time,4,mgi2sh,0,"Hello Humans

I am a Male with quiet BPD

I just got out of a 3 year relationship the first 2 years went off rather well besides need constant validation of her love but the last year became rather rocky I hit a depression spout and me and my so/fp started getting distant 2 months before our break up she initiated a ""break"" for us to start working on ourselves I actually handled this rather well and we both agreed to to not see anyone or talk to anybody during this time. We lived together so I took the basement she took the downstairs and we acted like friends. It worked for a bit but then the insecurity started acting up. 

I started noticing her behavior changing drastically and she started being much more cold she had always been extremely honest and kind somthing I held very dear to our relationship as my ex before her was not which to put bluntly fucked me up and I opened up to her about that and she knew. I started snooping and things were not adding up like how she said she'd be at a particular friend's but on her snap map was somewhere completely else among other things. I confronted her and she acused me of being crazy and being insecure.

This led me to getting some therapy and really opening up to a psychologist about my past and feelings and getting diagnosed with BPD the behaviors with my girlfriend continued and it started to put me on the deep end I started getting obsessed with a thought pattern of she is seeing someone else to I am being crazy she is not the type of girl to do this she knows what happned to me she would never. After a month of this she decided to move out so we could have space so we could have more alone time and we would be putting more effort into seeing each other I thought that made sense.  After that she got more distant with the texting and I started texting more and more I was going fucking crazy to put it simply. 


I visited her one night at her new place and brought her a coffee and some house warming gifts and she asked me a really random question of ""was I akward when we first started daiting?"" I said what no? She said okay I then asked why have you been on dates she said of course not I then said you can tell me if this break has been to test the water with new men I just want to know because my ex did pretty much the same thing and she went off on me for comparing her to my ex and told me to leave


So I figure for my own sanity we should break up so I break up with her but then my brain is like bruh wtf did you just do so then I start trying to win her back dumb move so for a week I feel like shit I start feeling really bad because she told me I ruined her mental health for the last 2 months and just so much stuff.

I get suicidal and make an attempt really dumb it wasent just about her I had no job my grades in college we all fails my house was disgusting everything was just shit 


I survive my attempt end up in the psych ward we talk she says we can still make this relationship work but I really need to get some help I agree  

2 days later she's in a new relationship I feel like fucking trash but here is the kicker all my crazy snooping all my insecure shit I did after talking with a friend who knows this dude correlates with 100% that she was seeing this dude for the whole 2 months that this shit was going on

The psych ward really helped me understand my diagnosis and got me on some meds that help me tremendously I just got a really good job and have a good social network of friends

But relationships I lose my self everytime

My ex before this same thing happned she started seeing another dude and the warning signs fired off and I ignored them and it fucked me up and it happned again


I am absolutely terrified of another relationship and obviously I'm not going to get into one for a long time I'm still imaging my ex happy with this dude getting fucked by him and it sucks

But I wana know BPD people of reddit

How do grow attached to people over the course of years but are able to walk away when they start degrading you as a person.  A part of me knew what was happening but I couldint imagine walking away for a second 

Thank you for reading

Do people with bpd hide it?,1,mghxba,4,"I have bpd (according to my therapist and psychiatrist but I can't technically be officially diagnosed until I'm 18) and I'm very open about it. In fact, I talk about it quite a lot. The problem? I know that most people with disorders such as depression, anxiety etc don't talk about it and hide it. Now, I'm not saying that all those things are similar to bpd, I'm just saying that the thing about depression, for example, is that a lot of people say that real depressed people don't show it. So I'm asking this simple question, is the situation with bpd similar? I really don't want people to think I'm faking it because I talk about it."
My 'friends' don't want me as part of their group anymore but can't admit it so they string me along,2,mghrnh,3,"As lockdown is coming to an end and people are starting to make plans again I figured I'd try and be more sociable. I have a group of friends who I have majorly detached from because they would always make plans and not invite me or stand me up on the day. I've chilled out massively over the last couple of years but I used to be very emotional and let people know when they had upset me which scared them off.  Over lockdown they have been very keen to make plans with me. Wanting to book lots of festivals and events but I've held back from committing a lot because they always let me down. It's important to note that they're very good at pretending these big plans are happening and I'm invited but they never go ahead but the small plans they make happen and I'm never invited.

One of the people let it slip today that the group were all meeting up this weekend to hang out and it just made me feel like shit. Why pretend you want me to hang out with you? That you wanna do stuff with just me and them and not the whole group but when it comes down to it I'm the only one not invited. It's like I've been exiled but they're all too cowardly to admit it so they dangle the bait.


I said I hope they have a nice time and let me know of it happens again as it would be cool to come but no reply lol. They're just so self absorbed and toxic but I literally have no other friends to hang with, which is why I guess I'm hanging onto the friendship.

Just wish I had friends who wanted to hang out with me and thought I was great and appreciated me because I'm a good time gal!! Haha"
Agitated at work,1,mghn18,1,"I work for a help desk and Im having a hard time today.  EVERYTHING is getting on my nerves. Im afraid Im going to say something that will get me in trouble. Other than frequent breaks, I don't know what else to do."
mom..,9,mghdjm,2,"If the title scared you too then you should understand this post. 
So me and my mom have an awful toxic off an on relationship. one day we are good one day we aren’t. one day she hates me and i’m so disrespectful, the next she loves me and wouldn’t be able to get anything done without me. The reason for this is we both have extremely terrible mental health. (BPD for both, anxiety, clinical depresssion it’s all there.) Sk communication doesn’t come easy for us. Over the years I’ve tried to better myself for the both of us and all it does is hurt me, so i’ve had to start bettering myself for just me. My biggest fear is turning out like her but lately i can’t stop seeing the resemblances. it’s like everything i’ve tried to run away from and every way i’ve tried to be better than her, i’ve become her. and that’s scary to me. does anyone have any advice? how do i maintain myself without letting her ruin me? how do i get past the gaslighting without feeling as if i’m insane, how do i get past the manipulation and not let it be me who’s getting all twisted. i need others stories of shitty mother’s who ruined them too bc i’m really at a loss rn and it doesn’t seem like i’m ever gonna win. just wanna hear some success and that for some, it gets better. maybe i even need to hear for some it doesn’t. idk what i need but this place felt like the right place to put it all out there. sorry this is kinda chaotic"
“Coping” isn’t an option for me,4,mgh63j,3,"In order to “cope”, I would have to deem the things I find unacceptable to be acceptable. That’s just simply not possible for me. 

Really, I don’t think I belong here in this world. I’ll always feel out of place, and that’s just how it is. I like to think that perhaps I was put here as a punishment for something I did in a past life, or something like that- and maybe in the next life I’ll ascend to where I belong after the suffering I’ve endured here.  

My soul just simply does not belong here, I don’t like people and don’t find most relatable at all. Most are selfish beings that are looking only to boost their ego, and thrive off of what they can leech off of others. 

It’s just a very difficult world to live in these days and I’m ready to leave. 

How do you cope?"
"He's hurt and jealous, and I can't give him what he needs. Should I just end it to save him from me.",3,mgh58c,2,"I'm diagnosed BPD he has no diagnosis so who knows. This is what I do know:

I can't be there for him like he needs. When he gets upset/angry I get scared. When I'm scared I stick to myself more. He wants me to cuddle him and hold him close through it. 

Dude really? You just punched the table. I'm not gonna hug you, I'm scared of you. 

I've tried explaining this to him and he still says I don't care. Why? I'm not physically their for him. It's a vicious circle all right.

On top of this I made a new friend and I think he feels threatened by him. Every time we talk he's leg shake goes through the rough. He asks what were talking about and just because it's something funny he has a cow.

And the cherry on top is when I ask him whats wrong he just tells me he's anxious or bothered by something but never what it is. I try to lead him to telling me but it's like pulling teeth. Eventually he tells me... when I'm at the end of my rope. And of course it just ends in a shouting match with him feeling like I don't care and me feeling defeated because I did my best. 

Idk what to do anymore. I'm getting tired of it. I'm never their for him apparently. I'm about to show him what me not being their is really like. Just cold shoulder the shit out of him. 

I've tried ending things with him but he always gets all ""I'll do better I love you, you're amazing"" 

I'm thinking of leaving the apartment one morning and crashing on someone's couch until he can find a place of his own. Let him take/do whatever he wants. Idk how much longer I can be the problem when I try my God damn hardest every day. Something has to give."

I'm not where I want to be in my life and my mental health has only gotten worse, last year intensified it. 2020 was a shitshow with covid, personal family/life struggles and that's when my therapist said I show some characteristics of BPD. That all really put me in a dark place where I was suicidal for awhile..I am in a somewhat better place then last year, but that's due to therapy, and a group dbt course I started taking a few months ago. I'm on a new medication and it's still kicking in, it's only been 2 weeks but I haven't noticed a change yet besides sleepiness. It's after 2 ineffective attempts with other medications. It's been years since I've been TRULY happy and I am feeling so hopeless. I feel flawed and unloved, and I fear age 30 is just going to be another year of unhappiness and struggle."

When I was 13, on the 26th of August I was walking to school when I saw a man collapse. I was alone, I ran to him and uses the raised road blocks as leverage to get him on his back. I put my arms around his shoulders. He'd cut his head. He tried to speak to me, he looked me In the eye and died.

I fainted, then called an ambulance. I found a man jogging who helped me and put his arm around me and walked me to school. I was in shock.

What does spiraling mean?,0,mgft8a,3,"Hey, so I made a thread like this earlier today but it got deleted due rule 10; post lenght. I would like to ask you guys what does spiraling mean? I have seen people using it many times but not sure what it means.

I also don't understand why my post got deleted, I just wanted simply answer to my simple question.

TL:DR; What does spiraling mean?"
"Psychiatrist cancelled today's appointment by automated email, with no further explanation or offer to reschedule",4,mgfnqg,1,"I'm so glad I'm not currently in the same mindset I was in when I made the appointment, because I was desperate, at my wit's end, had to gather all my courage to reach out for help.

This cancellation may have tipped me over the edge when I made the appt two days ago, but today it's just a minor annoyance.

And a mental note to make the next appt with a different doctor, because that shit is unprofessional."
"My sister (31y/o) has BPD, I was 12 y/o the first time she tried to ""get away from this world""",3,mgfiz1,4,"It has caused a lot of trauma. From the time I was 14 until I was 20, I took the bus for 7 hours to be with her every other weekend, so I could protect her from herself. Every time she called, I thought the worst. When I was 20, I cut the contact  with her, I could not live like this. She did not get better by me being there for her.

Now I am 24 years old, me and my sister talk for half a year, then she blocks me for the next half year and this has been the case for a long time. Every time I am at home, or with her in person, I find it difficult. I have to be careful about everything I say, even when I have thought out all the possible scenarios and then say something well planned, she finds a way to make what i said offencive. I'm completely devastated after two days of being around her.

It is not possible to bring things up, talk about problems, etc. I have tried that for many years and nothing works. 

I need help, how do I handle this / how do I do things right? I love her so much, but its so hard. Also if u have any tips on how to get her to make good economical choises, please also comment that.."
Is there anyone who made it back from this far down?,14,mgferq,5,"I’m further down than I ever have been. I don’t think I’ve ever hit rock bottom like I have recently. I have no one. My partner is even becoming a source of stress for me because of my inability to sleep. Everyone has been stripped out of my life and turned against me. I’ve lost friends, partners, parents, and all motivation to continue.

I told my partner today that I knew I was going to kill myself in a month or so if things didn’t improve. I know things won’t improve. They can’t possibly improve enough for this to be bearable. I haven’t slept a full night in I don’t know how long. I can’t find the motivation to do any of my coursework. My private life has been ripped out from under me and displayed for everyone to know. I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to shower, I don’t want to try. I can’t regulate my emotions at all anymore. I have no security, no privacy, and no stability. 

These days I’m either dissociated or extremely depressed (or both). Nothing is working. I’m going to therapy, I’m being vulnerable and trying to get better; I’m doing everything I should be. I have a partner who desperately wants to see me get better.

How do I tell him that I don’t think anyone has ever fallen as far down as I am and survived it..? I can’t give him false hope anymore. I’m going to die like this."

Is there someone...,106,mgejm9,34,"...who really wanted to die bcs of the intensity of their (bad)feelings/emotions but on the other hand they're afraid to die so...

Is there someone who lives with bpd and can control their emotions or live with them without feeling like the only way to escape this bullshit is to kill themselves?

I feel like shit and I don't know how it will last. I'm too afraid of what s after that (not that I believe in God or smth but I have a strange belief that every variable is valid and it might happen and I m not sure which one is true). So I'm not killing myself just for the moment. But sometimes I think about dying like a normal thing... and today, during a meltdown I was sure that is the only way to escape this feelings is to simply die."
Skeptical of everyone,6,mgdevm,1,"I have trouble trusting the people who are closest to me. I immediately think they have bad intentions and want to hurt me emotionally.

 I have experienced too many times where people take advantage of how much that i genuinely care and love people. I eventually developed this terrible consensus with myself that I always need to have my guard up. 

When I tell people about my illness it is the one thing that really scares me. Especially when people start blaming things saying “oh it’s because of your BPD”. When I actually do have a legitimate reason to be upset. This is where it gets really tricky and frustrating because people will take advantage no matter what. No one I have told has been able to resist the urge to use it against me. 

I have learned to forgive people, since no one is perfect but I still deep down don’t trust anyone. Not even myself. Feels lonely."
I am getting better slowly,2,mgcdwv,0,"About a year ago: Met My current SO. I put him through all the Borderline ""tests"" If u will...I had many a freak out, I looked like a child out of control sometimes. I recall hardly letting him sleep sometimes, always threatening suicide, doing everything I could to sabotage myself and our relationship.

I used to try to hang myself frequently in the closet, and I choked myself a few times with different wires and things. I remember wanting to die very very badly. But my SO was the only beacon of sanity and normalcy in my life, so although I did everything you're never supposed to do in a relationship besides cheating or trying to hurt my SO, I did what I could to warn him about my condition and  myself, gave him all the advice I could including telling  him to leave me. He didn't. He's a bit codependent, and I admit he deserves so much better.

 This was the first time in a while that I had no stable home, I was fighting many ppl and had ruined a couple of my friendships leaving me in some very shitty situations including being right back in the home I grew up in with my father who has always been abusive. My father creeped on both of my older sisters when they were young, but he never did anything to me, so I still call him dad, but obviously that is always in the back of my mind now.

My dad started dating a lady shortly after my mom left him, and she HAS to be borderline, because she physically tries to fight just about anyone and everyone, drinks alcohol daily, and has been abusive to my dad. Most people don't realize this but, my Dad was abusive to my mother and almost killed her a few times, he even ran her over with a truck by accident once. Now: get ready for the ultimate example of karma. My dad meets this lady, and she turns the tides onto him. She dominates the relationship, once she kicked him in the throat. And get this: She ran him over in the exact same spot that my dad ran over my mom. Same road, same area, same drunken accident. The result of this was his bladder had burst, and my dad was in the hospital for awhile. Anyways: My dad still lives in the house we grew up in with Him and my mom, except now he has this new lady that is equally as crazy, and they have two kids together. Both are growing rapidly.

SO, while I was staying there it was like a flashback to my childhood, in almost every way, except my mother was a nice person. I got to live with them for awhile, and one night Stepmom gets hammered and starts screaming at me down the stairs, basically calling me a slut and accusing me of wanting to sit on my dad's lap etc. It was fucking scary and my mental health had never been so terrible. I was smoking a lot of cigs.

Needless to say, during this time in my life and, don't be fooled: this was not the half of the chaos...I was very very suicidal and at the end of my rope. 

My SO saved my life, and showed me what love really means. He and I didn't have our own place so we were literally living in his truck some nights, and his family hated me so I lived with them for a little while but that quickly turned into a nightmare because I'm 100 percent sure his brother, 30 yrs of age is a narcissist. I'm not just throwing that word around either, he has the full blown disorder, so we clashed to say the least and he kicked me out. So, it was ridiculous. I still haven't fully processed the whole thing, It makes me extremely uncomfortable to think about all the things that happened. Sometimes I swear I have the worst luck, but I know I brought it all on myself in some way.

FFWD a year later and here we are today, the amount of episodes I have are very slim. I haven't tried to kill myself nearly as actively or aggressively. I have gone off of anti-depressants and feel better. Still have sleep issues, still have episodes, just not as bad. 

Were living in a different town, and this side of my SO""s family basically just minds their business and is NORMAL. So I haven't dealt with any family fueds, and I am living with my SO in a stable home. Things are good, and though I still have my episodes, I truly think things are much better inside of me. I don't feel like I want to die anymore, and my relationship is a lot less toxic.

I know I'm a piece of human garbo sometimes, but I also don't believe everything is all my fault. I can take responsibility for the things I've done, But i also just don't believe in good and bad, black and white. I think everything has a bit of good and a good of bad. So I have come to appreciate my illness to some extent, and I have learned from the things I've done to some degree. I think I am getting better, I feel like I can do it  and I feel like anyone reading this can do it too, we can all get better and do better and be better, whatever that means. I would have made this post a lot longer but I don't know if people give a shit to read it all so I just wanted to make it as short as possible. THnx for reading folks.

TL;DR - A year ago shit was chaos, now shit not so so bad."
How can I do self therapy? Are there any specific methods to help with my symptoms?,1,mgbmw7,4,"How does self-therapy work for an undiagnosed person? Background story included.

Hi! I'm a 21 male in SoCal currently going to community college. I want to be a journalist or PR agent :-)

**Backstory** 

 I was bullied in high school because I was ""attention-seeking"" and a "" drama queen"". Symptoms started to escalate after my sophomore year, where I felt everyone was gaslighting me and talking about me behind my back then saying I was there but I couldn't post them on social media or tell people we were hanging out. I felt insane and the symptoms just got worse (August 2015- June 2018).
 At the same time, my parents got divorced (2016) and my dad is an obsessive hover parent up until recently

 My mom is an "" if I do something nice for you then you owe me"" type of parent. I was never allowed to be excited about something because I should be ""humble"" and if I won second place she would say I should have gotten first.  I would be upset after school, and get in trouble for ""bringing the mood down"" whenever I came home To this day I'm scared of going into my hometown because I might see someone I knew, or someone seeing me,. I avoid it at all costs and even run to my car since someone passed by my house to laugh at me the last time I was caught outside. 

 After I graduated I stayed in the local community college to be close to my brother who had a terminal illness and passed away that September. My mom spent the entire savings they had knowing this day would come on the man she had an affair with. I've been stuck at home ever since not allowed to move unless it's for a university.  Knowing I can't afford college without their help, I have to play the game and I'm near the end set to transfer in spring 2022!  (2018-present) 

As of recent ( December 2020), I talked to people who admitted they knew what they were doing. I realized I wasn't insane and my reactions were justified, but I can't really shake the symptoms that got me in that position, and find it harder to control my thoughts without maximum effort. My parents acknowledged they weren't trying to be understanding but what’s done is done and i’m just trying to get over it. In 2019 they both decided I was ""eating my check"" so they forced me into buying a used Nissan Sentra for $14k with a 12% Apr. My mom paid it off in its entirety this last month after admitting it was a ploy for me to use my money I had saved to not move away off impulse, and to increase her credit after her boyfriend left her bankrupt.

 My dad went along since he's obsessive and wanted me to at home. His ex-fiance lived with us for a year  (2019- August 2020) Every night mandatory dinner as a family, regardless if I had homework or had just come home from work. If I didn't eat they'd complain that I'm so bashful and shouldn't eat at all. They split and as of two months ago are back together, while she remains in her moms house. My dad doesn't like the idea of an empty house, so he has two strangers sharing the house with my 14-year-old sister and I.

 A therapist said  I show signs of BPD and trauma, and because of insurance changes, his focus on the payment mid-session, and his mood seemingly out the door as soon as he came to the conclusion that it may be BPD I didn't go back. Mental Health isn't part of my insurance plan, so any type of outside help in that regard isn't in the cards at the moment. I know a therapist isn't a psychologist, so I'm not sure where to start with self-therapy or even what books to read since I'm not sure what I would be trying to treat. I can list symptoms I normally have and maybe someone here can help me narrow it down to books or techniques that deal with them? Thank you in advance! 

\- Impulsivity to post for attention or to check in on friends all the time

- i treat people like they’re my best friend if i like them initially. some people i have to warm up to but others i instantly think we’re partners in crime after one smoke sesh 

\- Impulsivity to cut off all friends 

\- Mood swings that I internalize, but sometimes slip if I'm triggered enough

\- (not anymore) wanting to steal minor things from friends. Never from stores, as I get too nervous. But a $1 bill on the floor? I truly didn't see an issue with it at the time. 

\- Obsessions over actors in shows, things I do, mannerisms others do, fake situations, something someone said to me, etc. It seems like I mirror and store the things I like, and forget about the ones I don't.

\- Intrusive thoughts of hurting myself or family members. I also get thoughts of texting them randomly that I'm running away or that I hate them. I never mean it and get sad that I would even want to do that

\- I don't date because I get obsessed very easily when I notice someone is interested in me. The last guy I talked to I checked his location over 20 times a day I never mean to do this, and usually, catch myself and stop until I lose control again. 

\- Seeing others with something I want ( a tv role, a nice car, a friend group), and get very upset 

\- Sensitive to criticism. Very much. I’ll obsess over what they said and think how they’re ridiculous. i’ll catch myself and acknowledge it’s not that serious 

\- Impulses to push people's buttons. I love my friends, but I'll randomly blurt out that they're useless,. or if they tell me something I do bugs them I instantly want to do it all the time

\- The biggest issue that hinders me is the lack of continuity and lack of a sense of identity. I feel like i’m a mesh of every best trait i’ve encountered until i have an episode then the “real” me comes out  

I hope this wasn't too long, and any methods to help me as well as books, videos, etc would make the world of difference.

 I know I'm partly to blame for what's happened to me in the school sense and avoid parent conflict by holding my tongue 100% of the time which is getting very difficult, but I'll be transferring this spring and don't want to repeat that cycle and start a life where I can have friends without them fizzling out or constantly having to remind myself it's all in my head, even sometimes when it isn't. Sorry for the long read, I feel better having even told my story to avoid in its entirety. Thank you in advance:-)

edit: I now have a lot of friends over online ( schools online ) and irl mediums and I do very well with catching myself being annoying or self absorbed. Is being aware and critical of what you’re doing a good step?"
How do you deal with dreams?,6,mgb9hw,1,"It feels absurd at this point. I make rational progress and then fall apart with suicidal dreams about ex every single night.

I don't really like believe dreams are mystical or even meaningful beyond memory, but I have no idea how to slow or change this. Is there even any method just to calm it?"
Feeling of being a lost case,20,mgamu5,4,"Do anyone else feels like you a lost case and it will never be okay again?

I feel like I’m a lost case. Going now through my third depression in the last 5 years. I have 0 self confidence in myself atm not for a job not for dating or meeting a girl. It’s like I lost my whole personality. I used to be someone fun, people loved to be around me. Now i lost everything, i feel ashame of myself, would rather stay at home not going out, so i dont have to deal with the outside world. I’m asking myself how will I ever meet a girl, if I’m like that. Who will want a man like me. All these thoughts together brings me to be suicidal. Does anybody recognise these thoughts and behaviour? Is it curable? I don’t want to stay like this."
Why can’t I change?,5,mgai7g,1,"(18 M) I recall being a happy child, I was outspoken, loud, smart, I used to do very well in school, was in the gifted program at my elementary school. So at first, it was very hard to piece together how I ended up being my present self. Today I see myself as the polar opposite of who I once was. I’m not happy, I don’t speak out, I'm very shy, and I haven’t attended school since October of last year. This is supposed to be my senior year, I’m supposed to be graduating in 2 months. Instead, I’m rotting away at home, playing video games and distancing myself as far away from reality, smoking weed till my neurons burn out. I used to work at a restaurant, used to be a food runner and dishwasher on the weekends, I would be a server night shifts during the week on occasion too. But I quit because it was all too much for me, most days I was scheduled to go in I would get pre-shift anxiety. Working the shifts wasn’t any better, I would constantly forget things told to me seconds before, unconsciously take food out to the wrong tables. The job itself wasn’t that terrible, probably the most organized restaurant I have ever worked at, I just wasn’t good at it anymore. Growing up my parents owned a Mexican restaurant, they sold it 2 weeks before quarantine back in March of last year. At a young age, I was expected to start helping out. If I wanted to buy something I’d have to pay for it with my own money. By 7th grade, I was fully responsible for buying my clothes and paid with my own money every time I went out with friends. Truthfully though I hated having to work and I always despised my parents for it.

  I would compare myself to other kids and I would envy them because their parents wouldn’t force them into child labor. They also had present parents, mine were always preoccupied with the restaurant. I grew up feeling like I wasn’t a priority, always put to the side. Things worsened for me when I had to move schools transitioning into middle school. In elementary, I was always really well-liked by my classmates and was buddy with everyone. In Middle school things were different. I didn’t know any of the kids I went to school with, I was always friendly to everyone but for some reason, these kids didn’t take a liking to me. For the first time, I was truly alone. My parents were never around, my brothers were teens doing their own thing, and my childhood friends were gone. I started becoming depressed but didn’t know it at the time. School which had always been fun for me wasn’t of interest anymore, I started throwing random fits with my parents out of lack of words. In 7th grade, once I had finally settled with the emo clique and knew what depression was I decided to confess to my mom how I felt. She was lecturing me because I wasn’t doing well in school. I tried giving my side but when I said I was depressed she cut me off, told me I had it easy, and had nothing to be depressed about. After that I learned to not come to my parents with any personal problems, they’d be too busy or simply wouldn’t understand. 

  Transitioning into high school I had a very positive mindset. It was gonna be a fresh start, and there would be way more classmates than in middle school, nearly impossible to not meet like-minded people. My close middle school friends I made were not going to attend the same school as me but that was okay, as I felt us drifting apart anyway. I was over my rebellious too cool for school phase, I was ready to do excellent in HS with college in mind. To great disappointment high school wasn’t much different than middle school, the kids didn’t dislike me but I still didn’t feel like a fit. I was attending a brand new high school, I was part of its first freshman year class. The environment was very new to me too, I’m Mexican grew up around other Mexicans and people of color. This school that I was attending was mostly white populated, and lots of the kids were somewhat wealthy. Competing for a high-class rank seemed pretty impossible. I’ve always humbly considered myself smart but in high school, there were kids to who I felt inferior. Even though we were in the same grade they were more knowledgeable, had gotten better schooling, and had involved parents. The idea of graduating with good grades and a high rank completely left my mind early on freshman year.  I was lucky enough to go to a concert that year which gifted me with some temporary older friends. I went out and partied with them a few times and I felt free, I felt like I belonged. Unfortunately, My party friends and I didn’t last cause I was uncomfortably attached and pushed them away, but hanging with these people made my wanderlust. I realized how unhappy I was and suddenly my school seemed insignificant to me. The school itself was built on a field in the middle of nowhere, most of the people were conservative, and the whole school was only made up of freshmen and sophomores. I remember feeling defeated and frustrated because I could not imagine living the life I was living for the next 4 years. There was no way to leave, my parents would have to approve of that and I was conditioned to not ask for help. It was also at this time that I started turning to hookups and mindless sex as a coping mechanism. I figure I used to do it cause it made me feel like I had some control over the choices made in my life and it provided validation from men. Even though I still struggle with this behavior now as an adult I see how unhinged and erratic this was, especially for my age at the time.

  Sophomore year by far was the most memorable of all my high school years. The new school year wasn’t terrible at all. I had gotten into Newspaper class and had my group of friends, I no longer felt like an outsider. That year I turned 16 and I was finally old enough to start applying for jobs other than my parents’ restaurant.  I got a job at Waffle House along with my best friend at the time. There I met a coworker with who I fell into limerence. Working at Waffle House on its own was not a pleasant experience but I had my best friend there and the boy I was in “love” with made it worth it. I decided to quit when my “lover” kept playing with my emotions, or what I perceived as that.

    Also by some strange coincidence, the school 
district decided to make a new boundary map for the upcoming Junior year. My neighborhood was no longer zoned to my current high school. Current attending students had the option to stay, and while the timing was a bit off, I still wanted to leave my current whereabouts. I saw the move as an opportunity to reinvent myself, meet new people, and start fresh. That transitioning Summer into Junior year I started smoking pot with another of my close friends. At first, I would only smoke socially but I loved the high, soon enough I started regularly smoking on my own. The cycle of never fitting in had repeated itself. My ex-friend group from my previous school cut me off after I left. I remember having a chat with my ex-best friend telling her I wish we would stay close but I knew after I left, our friendship wouldn’t last. Of course, that was just me being a pessimist, my friends thought I was permanently saying goodbye. I tried reaching out and fixing our friendship but the efforts weren’t reciprocated. I felt especially stupid when I tried again almost a year later, only to find out they had moved on. I was no longer a part of their lives, I was simply a ghost from the past.

  Things were finally starting to look up around the time my parents sold their restaurant. For years I had been pointing out how most of our family issues were rooted in the restaurant. And when they sold it, things were significantly better. I even saw myself building relationships with my parents. Rationally I was old enough to know they didn’t purposely neglect me growing up, I was still not completely healed but I was at peace. That peace continued for maybe 2-3 months after quarantine started, then things deteriorated quickly. 

  Back in June, I had a clinic check-up, because of covid the check-up was changed to an online virtual visit. To join the visit I was asked to download a specific app. This app, in particular, doesn’t mirror your face camera on the screen as the meeting is in progress, instead, it is flipped. As the meeting was going on and I was forced to look at my face, I started to become uncomfortable, something was off. As I watched my face in the camera I couldn’t help but to notice how droopy the right side of my face was, I tried tilting my head straight hoping maybe that would help but it did not. Afterward, it was clear something wasn’t normal. I remember being told as a kid my forehead sinks on one side, and now and then someone will make a comment asking why my face is the way it is. Strangely enough, when I look in the mirror or take a mirrored selfie I can’t see the asymmetry, it’s only there when I purposefully look for it or when I see an image of myself flipped, because of this I was never bothered by my appearance before. Once the asymmetry became noticeable to me then I started asking questions. Why do I look like this? What’s the cause behind this? Can this even be fixed? With the very limited info I had, I made various google searches. “Facial asymmetry” led me to “plagiocephaly”, which is a flat spot that forms on a baby’s head when they prefer sleeping on one side of their head too much. Treatment for this is simple, repositioning your baby’s head and have them wear a special helmet that helps their head gain proper shape. This search led me to a more severe version of plagiocephaly “craniosynostosis” this version of the flathead deformity is believed to be genetic. It happens when a baby’s skull sutures prematurely close before the brain fully develops. As the brain grows its grows in every direction except where the sutures already closed, forming a non-symmetrical head shape. Treatment for this requires surgery to relieve pressure in the baby’s head and correct its shape. It’s vital to know treatment for synostosis has to be done at an early age before the skull is fully developed, if not then the damage is permanent. I didn’t want to take an educated guess on which one I had so I decided to ask my mom for some clarity. She confirmed my suspicion, I indeed was born with craniosynostosis. When I asked why I wasn’t given the surgery I was told it was too risky too much potential for something to go wrong. Thing is... I researched the surgery and it's completely safe, complications during the surgery are very rare. When I was explaining the helmet method to my mom she said it was done on me. Yet, I’ve never seen any baby pictures, or have I heard anyone recall the time I wore a plastic helmet for 6 months. 

After finding out that big chunk of information, my relationship with my parents went back to being dead.  This whole situation just engraved the memories of being neglected even more. Not only was I lied to straight to my face but I had to make myself aware of my head deformity, my incompetent parents couldn’t even do that. It makes me question what else they’ve been keeping from me, synostosis is also linked to genetic syndromes, for all I know I could have one of those too. And what makes it worse is they’re completely oblivious to all the agony they’ve caused me. I’ve always wondered why I’ve never been able to seemingly fit in. I’ve always felt different from others, and in many ways I am, sometimes I feel completely alien. Thing is, I was never conditioned to think of myself as any different from anyone else. I wasn’t even fully aware I wasn’t symmetrical till I was 17, now I feel like some freak of nature. Before I was aware of my asymmetry I didn’t realize how many funny glances I get, Now when I’m out in public it’s very irritating. Also doesn’t help when you’re gay and your community is super shallow and materialistic. 

   One of my biggest fears is I’ll never know true love because of my appearance. Because of this, I gave this guy who was interested in me a shot, for some reason though I’m never attracted back to someone who has an initial interest in me. Right off the bat, I was the one who started rushing things, I asked him out after just a week of talking to each other, I said I love you first when I didn’t. I led him on, I was selfish, I did what others had done to me before because I wanted to feel desired and loved. I thought “maybe I don’t love him now but I can grow to love him.” Soon I realized that wasn’t going to be doable, I couldn’t force a feeling and my sexual cravings were too strong. I will admit to having a hypersexuality problem, I don’t know if these particular urges were because I wasn’t in love with my partner or because I’m a sex addict that can’t settle with just boning the same person all the time. 

  I have all these behaviors and coping mechanisms that I now realize are wrong. I’m completely aware of my self-sabotage and that I need therapy, I’m finally old enough to get the help on my own. I know everything I’m doing wrong and I understand my emotional self very well. So why is it so hard for me to change? Why can’t I break and unlearn all these bad habits? Why can’t I get in motion towards my betterment?"

just today they told me that when im mad i'm scary and that i direct my anger upon them, which i didn't know. they always ask for me to vent to them when i experience my moodswings, i wasn't aware that me venting about the situation was scaring them. 

they have real bad anxiety and told me that they are highly sensitive when people are angry around them, so they try to be nice to keep me from attacking them. i wasn't aware i was ""attacking"" them by being angry in our dms and ranting angrily about how everything is my fault?

anyway, just a few minutes ago i got into a really bad low and they just kept asking me what the cause was. i felt really bad and i didn't want to scare them so i told them to stop asking me about it. i did it simply, just a ""stop asking about it"" and they haven't texted me since and i have no clue why it's scaring me so much.

so now it's just making me feel so shit for not only being unable to express my emotions normally, but now i might accidentally scare the people i love? i feel so terrible. i just need to know if i'm toxic at all i guess. i'm scared to ask them for reassurance right now.

EDIT: i thought they went to bed! turns out theyre just ignoring me! i got a notification that they uplaoded a video on their YT channel. i tried to send a funny video but they never responded. whenever i try to apologize for my moodswings they tell me there's no need. i feel useless"
On new meds and feel like I'm losing it,1,mg8mq4,0,"The last few months I've been feeling so anxious and fearful and I feel like everything is fake, like maybe this isn't all real or that I died a long time ago and this is some weird afterlife or simulation. 

I broke down last night because I was sure that I was actually dead and that I had done something terrible many years ago and had killed myself. 

I went and saw my doctor today and was sure she was going to put me in a psych ward again but she just gave me a new prescription for Quetiapine, which is a brand of Seroquel (anti-psychotic) 

Is all this something that can happen to people with BPD? Or is this something different? I feel over time my bpd symptoms have for the most part improved, but other aspects of my mental health seem to be declining."
My FP is my abuser,4,mg8bxr,4,"Cw // mentions of emotional abuse 
.
.
I’m so frustrated with my brain for choosing out of everyone to rely on and depend all my emotions to, to be someone who is abusive and emotionally manipulates me into not leaving. I wanted him to my “my person” so badly. So so badly and it’s so overwhelmingly heartbreaking that he ended up like this. This has to be my fault. I must have did something to deserve this. I’m trying to convince myself I’m the problem and he’s not abusive and everything would be okay if i didn’t start arguments and have so many emotional outbursts"
"My boyfriend and I just had the worst fight of our relationship, and I am really struggling to know whether or not I am actually the toxic one here. I am so sad and really need help and insight.",5,mg7ylf,10,"Hi all. I'm extremely upset right now and my thoughts are all over the place and I can't stop crying, so I'm sorry if this is long/incoherent. He is 35 and I am 30.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (possibly ex now?) and I have been dating for 3 years and living together for 2.5 of those years. Our relationship has been very turbulent. I was diagnosed and have started going to therapy in the past few months, and I think I've gotten a lot better (though I'm far from perfect). The last month of our relationship has actually been pretty peaceful, with only a few minor conflicts, which is rare for us. He even said a few times that he could tell I was making progress.

.One of the things I'm hyper-triggered by is when he doesn't touch me like he normally does in certain situations. Every night, we watch TV together for a bit and he holds my hand/puts his arm on my leg or whatever else. On Thursday night, he wasn't responding to my touch at all (and was actually turning away from it) and I got a bit upset, but we got over it. Last night, the same thing happened, and I started feeling really anxious. We had friends over, and I had to go to the bathroom because I was starting to cry and sent him a text. It said ""Hey, this is probably irrational, but I'm worried you're upset with me or something is wrong because you're not touching me."" He responded that nothing was wrong, and that sometimes he just didn't feel like touching. I came back and he still wouldn't interact with me physically, which only heightened it more.

We had an argument about it before going to sleep and a long conversation about it this morning, where I said I would try not to be anxious if he didn't want to touch, but I also expressed that that kind of physical affection is important to me. We had a normal day, and then we sat down to watch TV. He held my hand for a bit (limply) and then took his hand away. I immediately felt anxious and sad. I kind of pushed my legs into him and said ""do you not want to touch?"", and he put his face in his hands and groaned. I asked if he was upset and he said he was, and that he felt like I was tracking every one of his minor movements. We started having an argument. He said that I got angry at him when he moved away and that that wasn't right. I said ""no, you got angry and frustrated at ME for feeling anxious"", and this somehow set him off. He cursed and stormed off upstairs and slammed the door and locked it. I followed him up and asked him through the door why he had gotten so upset and stormed off and if we could keep talking. He started loudly playing his guitar over me and ignoring me. I kept talking (I was saying things like, ""why am I not allowed to tell you that you also get angry in arguments without you storming off?""), and he eventually started yelling go away, leave me alone, I'm so sick of this shit, etc etc. I began to cry and begged him to come talk to me.

He yelled through the door that if I continued talking he would break up with me. Through my tears, I said this was extremely unfair and that I felt like he was trying to silence and control me by threatening that. He kept yelling it through the door, and I finally, sobbing, left and went back downstairs.

An hour later, he comes down and ignores me. I said ""cool, so we're just going to not speak to each other now?"" He said ""Quit this passive aggressive bullshit, you're just making things worse and there's no reason for it."" I said ""you're the one ignoring me when you walk right by me."" He ignored this and went back upstairs.

I felt incredibly angry at this point and followed him upstairs again. I told him I wasn't going to just be in a situation where my partner is giving me the silent treatment, and I said I wanted to resolve it rather than just letting things continue to suck (my voice was raised when I said this). He said that I was bothering him and he wanted to be left alone. I got even more worked up and said that I deserved to know whether we were breaking up or if we were going to resolve this. We started yelling at each other, with him yelling at me to leave him alone and saying I was being emotionally manipulative. I yelled that he had been being incredibly cruel to me and I didn't deserve it. I said he was a massive prick. He said that he was so sick of me, that he didn't like being around me, and that his life could be ""great and fun"" without me making it ""shitty and difficult."" I yelled at him to just break up with me then, if I make his life so horrible. I then started sobbing and asking if he really didn't like being around me. He said yes. I continued to cry and asked why he'd then told me just a few days ago that he loved hanging out with me and I was his best friend? He refused to answer. I kept crying and questioning him and he finally said that he hated being around me when I acted like a petulant child (which, he said, was a lot of the time). 

It was around this point that I said through my sobs that he was being so cruel to me, and he basically said he wasn't, and then ignored me as I kept trying to talk to him. I then just... snapped. I slammed the door of the room we were in and screamed FUCK YOU as loud as I could, and he yelled back at me. I then said some really horrible things-- that his dreams were childish and he was never going to achieve them, that he was basically a teenager stuck in a grown man's body, etc. He said I was a ""bitter and nasty person"". 

About 5 minutes after, I felt horrible for what I said, and I told him I was so sorry and that I was just trying to hurt him because I felt hurt. He said he didn't care what I had to say. He went to go sleep in the other bedroom and said that I showed my true colors. I said that I needed to know whether or not this was over so I could book a plane ticket, and he refused to answer and kept telling me to go away. He finally yelled, ""I'm not answering because I don't know yet."" and that was that.

I don't know what to think. I know that it's completely unfair of me to get anxious about him not touching me as much as I wanted him to, and I am very sorry for that. But I feel like he was absolutely horrible to me-- so much so that I felt compelled to say the most horrible things I could think of to him.

I don't think there's any coming back from this, and I'm not sure there should be. We are great when we're happy, but we absolutely bring out the worst in each other, and I feel like he treats me really badly sometimes. Or am I seeing this the complete wrong way and I am actually the toxic one? I am so confused and BPD makes it really hard to see what's really going on. Any advice would be so appreciated. thank you."
"I’m not trying but I no longer care if I do, at all",1,mg7nsj,0,"Tw self harm, assault, suicide 

-I have gone in to a career that I’m passionate about but it’s riddled with bullying, abuse, PTSD, and inherent burnout. Cool. Can’t leave though because I’m too far in (and I actually do like it tbh)

-I am back with my ex who continues to abuse me and I eat it up for whatever reason. Honestly one of the only things I look forward to.

-my only excitement in life is my cat and my podcast. And people hate the podcast so I can’t even talk about it lmao

-I’m losing weight because I feel sick but do not have time to go to the doctor because of school obligations. And death would honestly be a relief. 

-I have no social life at all

-I have literally not properly cleaned parts of my house in YEARS now. Guess I’m just lazy haha no such thing as mental illness nope just gross. 🙄 

-I have fallen back in to self harm, skin picking, and smoking. 

-in my free time I just sleep and cry but I do not sleep at all at night

-I keep having nightmares about my assaults which happened years ago so I’m not sure why that’s coming up now.

How am I supposed to spend my life like this? I literally cannot exist in any space online or irl without people shitting on me at all times for everything I do. At this point I just want to be like “oh yeah I’m a HORRIBLE worker I just purposefully suck” like I have no clue what people even want from me. 

I feel like I can’t even go to therapy because I have no money left (I spent my entire life savings on my cat which I don’t regret but it is a little rough) and all the therapists by me are CBT. CBT sucks for me because my brain is so fundamentally obliterated that none of the tactics work. 

I sometimes feel so sick that I think I’m just going to succumb to whatever is wrong with me (which doctors always say is nothing). And I’ll drift off thinking that I was a little bitch for complaining about my problems. Then I think about how my cat will eat me and how my best friend will be so mad and how my parents will disintegrate. Tad dramatic. But I truly think it will go down. 

Finishing my stupid degree is more important than me being sick. But ideally I’ll get checked out after graduation in may. Can’t treat the sick properly if I’m super sick... lol

I think that all of my various childhood traumas and assaults and struggles have all compiled in to a death sentence. The ACES study. 

I have so much dark that it’s bound to manifest in to cancer or something. In high school I stopped eating but then that metamorphisized into a whole other thing. 

I don’t care if people think I’m cringey or dramatic or anything because I’m convinced that when I die I will leave a paper trail of failures of all the collapsed support systems in my life. And I want people to see that and realize that there are things to fix for other people.

I could go on and live a relatively normal life on the surface while I just suffer quietly in my own domain. I could get so sick I’m forced to stop and I get mad. I could just die and get eaten by my sweet geriatric cat. I’d let him.

Sometimes I think about writing down all my stupid stuff but no one cares and if people do care it’s to make fun of me. I like the people that make fun of me a lot more when they at least sleep with me. 

I love my best friend, my family, and my cat. I want to live a noble life of saving people but in actuality I can only care for them but not myself. I feel like a lost soul stuck in a vessel of flesh. Always clinging to the things that keep me going and breaking when they leave. Glueing myself back together but never whole. 

anyway also looking for recommendations for best coffee and mac and cheese.......and canned cat food that’s good for old cats. 

sorry this is long lmfao"
Useful advice,7,mg7l2v,5,"What is one of the most useful pieces of advice that you have received on your recovery journey so far? It could be something you learned in therapy, a support group, from a mentor, during a meditation practice, or anywhere really."
How to Get Help,2,mg6pvl,2,"I have called so many different places to get therapy or medication, or both and nobody has gotten back to me. I was watching a show today called ""My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" (It's on Netflix) where it starts out as a comedy and she progressively does crazier and crazier things to end up with the guy that she loves, and ends up with a diagnosis of BPD. And it really hit home because I recognized a lot of parts of myself in her but it also hurt because she's able to get help when she wants it, and although I've tried, I can't.   


I don't want to end up committed again but I really really need help. This show also makes me feel sad because she has people who care about her, and I essentially have nobody. So now I'm feeling really depressed and hopeless because I can't get help and that's all i want now.   


TL,DR: I can't get any places to call me back to help me."
"I’m slipping, and I’m out of resources",3,mg6net,2,"Hi all

I’m a 25F quiet borderliner with a history of depression, anxiety and some undiagnosed reproductive issues. 

I’ve completed the Emotional Regulation unit of DBT about 2 years ago, recently trying EMDR. My current meds are 50mg sertraline and 10mg amitriptyline daily. 

These days, I’m struggling to get through a day without a fit of tears, a panic attack or thinking of suicide. My emotional regulation has gotten really poor and it’s impacting my relationship and my ability to work. 
I’ve had really poor memory of my childhood, along with some repressed memories from my more manic days that are starting to creep back in. The worst of these has been coming to grips with a sexual assault and all the things that memory beings with it. 

Normally at this point I’d be self-harming, but I’m in a stable and healthy relationship (!!!) and I know my partner would be so upset if I started again. 

I feel like I’m just drifting through life waiting to die, and I’m out of resources to try pull me out. 
I can’t lean on my partner or family anymore as they’re exhausted. It’s hard to find DBT in my city (and the only affordable/group option I found really triggering) and I’m also struggling with some physical health issues that heavily impact my mental health. 

I feel like I’m out of options - I’m doing all the things the doctors have been drilling into me for years but it’s not working.

Seeking any advice on how to pull myself up, please"
ADHD meds and BPD?,3,mg670r,3,"I know ADHD and BPD are often diagnosed together and share many of the same symptoms (especially emotion dysregulation and impulsivity), and I have both ADHD and BPD as well. 

I was wondering if anyone else has found ADHD meds to be effective for BPD? I’ve been taking Dexedrine/Adderall for a couple years and I noticed a huge improvement in a lot of my symptoms. The biggest change I noticed when I first started Dexedrine was a drastic reduction in my feelings of constant extreme guilt/shame for just existing. I would excessively ruminate over past social interactions, and it felt like all the bad things people have ever said to me were just constantly looping in my head in the background. I felt like an evil, unlovable monster because I couldn’t escape the hurricane of thoughts in my mind. But Dexedrine essentially eradicated this rumination, which in turn helped the guilt immensely. 

That being said, I still have many of the same BPD symptoms as before (especially emotion dysregulation), but I have a better self-image and don’t have that constant stream of negative thoughts looping in my head 24/7. And I also got addicted to Dexedrine/Adderall buttttt we don’t talk about that part. 

I’m curious if anyone else with BPD (whether or not you also have ADHD) has found ADHD meds to be helpful?"
In too deep/,5,mg631k,3,"I (23F) feel like it's too late for me to get help, or heal.   
I spend my days off either in bed or trying to seek validation from people who I'm not even slightly connected to. 

I have waited so long to get help or even try taking a step back from the nonsense to truly get a grip on who I am or what I want/need in life. I know I'm only 23 and have my literal whole life ahead of me but in times of sadness and well, BPD, it's almost impossible to hold onto that.    
I don't have health insurance or anything but I did apply, it's just hard because I fucked a lot of things up for myself and it's hard to start over in your 20's, especially since COVID-19 happened."
I always feel like I’m unlovable.,2,mg5z3a,5,"I don’t usually get the feeling that i’m unworthy of loves. I feel i’m unlovable. See, people like me at the begging, and i believe that they may develop romantic feelings for me.. but there’s something wrong with me (that i still don’t know what it is) that just make them leave. Maybe it’s my unrealistic fear of being abandoned or even cheated on. 
I don’t know, honestly. That feeling causes me so much pain.. I feel like everyone that leaves me become so better and much happier without me. Maybe I’m the kind of person that never stays in anyone’s lives.. I wish i had a long term relationship or friendship. It hurts to be alone all the time."
I just feel like I don’t want to be here 75% of the time.,50,mg5w6c,8,"I’ve never had a female friendship that has lasted. I always end up being hated in the friendship (legitimately, not in my mind) and it always ends with a blowout where I am told that J am selfish. This is so hard because I am constantly trying to be aware of what I’m doing but it’s like I’m aware of the wrong things? Like I don’t realize the things that I end up doing, even if they are small, and it always leads to the other person resenting me. I’ve recently had two girls (one a former roommate one a current) basically form a vendetta against me and now I am alone in my own house. I don’t know how much longer I can take this type of emotional pain. I thought it would end with my abusive boyfriend but it seems to follow me, no matter if i truly do try to be a good friend. It’s all I want to be."
Attention Seeking Behaviours,4,mg5opr,3,"When I’m overly emotional or have trouble regulating my emotions i tend to post a lot venting on my private snapchat stories. I’m worried this comes off as very attention seeking or maybe is unhealthy because it’s very much posted in the moment. I tend to use it as a coping mechanism because I want people to know I’m struggling but don’t know how to communicate it directly, posting on a story gives people the chance to reply if they wish rather than dumping all my emotions on one specific person.

I’m unsure what more experienced borderlines would have to say about this as its quite a new experience for me (6 months post diagnosis) and i’m struggling to know if this is something I need to self-regulate or not."
Personal Experiences with BPD,1,mg5e89,0,"I wanted to make a general statement about my own personal experiences in doing my best to get my mind on track while struggling with all the overwhelming emotion and impulsivity that come with it which tends to make us all seem so difficult. At some point I became aware of how much more deeply I felt than others, in a debilitating way. Little comments perceived as slights would get hyper focused on. Insecurity would sink in and no matter how hard I'd try to resist indulging I would always crack, blow up on someone either out of anger or sadness, end up feeling genuinely pathetic before finally going numb and wondering why any of it mattered in the first place. It's a very real, very isolating pattern that causes some of us to feel like we'll never manage to function properly.

 Those overwhelming feelings that get misrepresented due to the lack of emotional control and comes from such a real, very relatable place and I think if more people had awareness of the loneliness, shame and isolation that breeds these kinds of outbursts it would be easier to be more sympathetic. I eventually became aware of where these feelings came from, why they seemed so out of character. There was always a part of me that felt like it was screaming and thrashing, begging me to acknowledge the overwhelming feelings and act as fast as possible to soothe them. I started telling myself we were okay, I acknowledged all the pent up repression and my own loneliness. I remind myself it's okay to feel overwhelmed in the moment, it's okay to let the feeling wash over and feel it fully as long as you remember to let it go and approach whatever caused the feeling in a calmer state of mind. I believe whatever we've been through personally has given us the full spectrum of pain and emotion to an extent not everyone is made to feel. 

I'm not sure if I'd call it a silver lining or a gift but I'm glad to feel as much as I do. If we're vulnerable in one moment we can be stronger in the next and with the capacity to feel these debilitating, image shattering emotions is the chance to grow from every feeling. If you feel ashamed of your actions do your best to understand where they came from, try to catch those patterns and get ahead of your feelings. Remind yourself what it's like to feel a lot and that you've always come out of it in the end. I've spent a lot of time trying to get a handle on myself, I spent years struggling and feeling like I was this explosive problem. I've grounded myself with a core set of values based around how strongly I feel and the depth of the emotions we struggle with. 

I wanted to share my thoughts on BPD and mental illness in general because I truly believe a little understanding goes a really long way for people who feel so strongly and so misrepresented by their own actions. It's a very lonely, personal struggle and I just wanted to make a statement for anyone who's felt like me or like I do now or who can relate or take comfort in these words in any way. I'm sincerely proud to feel as much as I do, with pain comes perspective. I'd love to hear how other people try to take control of their feelings or even how you struggle with them. If anyone is willing to share their personal viewpoints on their own feelings I'm genuinely interested in the sense that I could learn from it and in the sense that we can share in the experience of being understood."
im doing a lot doesnt feel like enough,1,mg56jm,2,"doing a lot but no one around me cares. life seems to be unempathetic and a series of do this, do that, live life the way i intended. i live life the way i do and it's by the skin of my teeth. it's the facade and bullshit, life's just flashing between moments. i'm here and not there but way over there. if shit's a dream, then who'd care. 

i'm putting effort to stay here but it's not a single fuck given. can't be bothered to have self care cos i'm just acting plain silly. 

it's hard but i'm the abuser, not the victim, not in this moment, but i was once, and it's still stinging. i'm doing what i can to renew but god damn do i only see the old within the new. 

who the fuck is everyone, really? just a part of me, tormenting me, a side of me that i can't handle. i feel sick to my stomach in knots. i'm just hopeless in a land i've created, my own mind's prison glistening eye. 

i see past the torment pain and love and i see sheer terror. death looming nearby about to swipe all i know. and what of then when I'm gone who's to know. maybe i'm god or maybe i'm not. 

deaths always stalking a leering beast waiting till i look away to sink its teeth im terrified yet i cant stop looking into those soulless eyes waiting to take me in. 

fuck all this shit nothing ever feels real and im so unstable cos i feel im the only one that gets that. there sother parts but we cant connect cos were paralyzed under fear. i am too i dont want to connect i feel safe in repetitive comfort."
Thank you Tiktok,0,mg4ugk,0,"For so long I've know something was wrong with me (m23) and I didn't know what it was. I don't really talk about it but the few times I have with others bipolar disorder kept coming up. I kept assuming I was bipolar because of my fluctuating mood but I never really aligned with all the symptoms. I didn't want to go to a doctor and get told I was bipolar and they be wrong or even worst to find out nothing was wrong with me or I'm a different type of mentally fucked up. 

Disclaimer I haven't been diagnosed nor do I have tiktok but I have made an appointment with a specialist to finally find out. I know self diagnosing is sorta looked down upon but I was and I still am in tears from learning more about bpd. I felt so close and so disconnected to bipolar disorder that I was too afraid to  even seek mental help. So often have I read an article about being bipolar and seen bpd and just completely ignored it because I ignorantly thought it was related to multi personality disorder so I'm thankful that tiktok has opened up more conversations on the issue. I'm sorry it's being glamorous but where there is darkness there is hope and I'm know I'm not the only one who no longer feels lost. 

I will keep you guys updated but if you have any advice as I go down this journey please share because I'm currently still alone in this even though I've found this wonderful community."
DAE self harm but never cut?,24,mg4d7z,41,"My sister had BPD and was a big time cutter when she got really upset. She committed suicide back in 2015.

Seeing her arms with the scars scared me so I never grew the balls to cut myself.

If I get upset to the point where self harm is literally the only thing I can do I’ll either punch my right leg above the knee until I can barely walk or I’ll scratch my arms up to the point *just* before the bleed. They never scar thankfully.

Sometimes I’ll punch a wall or something hard but that’s not as common an punching myself in the leg or scratching myself."

I’m nothing but a bitch,1,mg3lwx,3,"When my fp and I get into an argument, he tells me he doesn’t care if i have bpd.. like at all.

I’ve told him multiple times what triggers me and he doesn’t care cause he continues to do it. For example, he loves the word ‘bitch’, every time we argue it’s ‘you dumb bitch’, ‘psychotic bitch’, ‘stupid retard bitch’, etc. 
Hearing someone who claims they “love” me say that saddens me. It makes me question everything and I start to get paranoid.

tbh our relationship is falling apart and I’m so fucking scared to lose him.. he said that i’m getting worse (I was recently diagnosed in Feb). Also, he recently told me that when we argue he just wants to beat me tf up and that he despises me. We argue about the same things too, I feel like it’s all my fucking fault. I feel like i’m the reason he doesn’t wanna have sex, text me, or be around me.. he even said he doesn’t even know why he’s with me anymore and that he doesn’t respect me or our relationship. I know I’m a lot to put up with and I have my flaws, but at the end of the day, I just wanna be enough..."

Help with getting over an ex,6,mg34lg,5,"Hello! Im a 19 year old F and I recently got diagnosed with BPD. Right now I am struggling to get over an ex bf/FP. My ex and I had a very strong personal connection because I lived with his family while I was moving out of an abusive household. We broke up because of an episode. It was my worst one yet and I feel really guilty for what I did. Long story short he now has a new girlfriend. This was so hard for me to come to terms with. I stopped sleeping, eating, and started having depressive thoughts. I finally started to feel like I was back on track when he called me late at night to tell me he missed and loved me. So now I’m back at square one. Obsessed over someone who is in a relationship. I don’t know if anyone has any advice for getting over a fp? This was my first serious relationship so I’m a little lost."
DAE experience “catastrophising” and does it sound like a part of BPD?,11,mg2wx8,3,"I’m from the UK and I have a diagnosis of EUPD. I’ve struggled for a very long time, but the past year I’ve noticed I have very severe anxiety. 

I get extremely paranoid, think everyone is out to get me (e.g. ‘expose’ me, like leaking an old conversation where I’ve called my friend a dick when upset), and every situation I do what my mum calls “catastrophising” - where I think the worst, such as breaking the speed limit once, thinking I’m going to get my driving licence revoked, then I’ll lose my job etc... I basically can’t think logically and rationally about situations. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else experiences this kind of behaviour? I know EUPD encompasses a lot of different emotions, and I’ve always struggled with anxiety to a degree, but what I suffer with currently is like nothing I’ve ever felt before. It was triggered after a crime was committed against me, which leads me to think maybe it’s specifically trauma induced and is separate to BPD... but it could just be another part of the illness that’s coming out to play... 

I know you guys aren’t doctors, but I would appreciate some insight as to whether this sounds like BPD behaviour or not. Thanks!"

Two Loofahs. A stupid poem I wrote.,3,mg2n35,0,"Two Loofahs

Something here is different.
I can’t quite place it yet 
Something is not the same

Hot water pounds my back
T I P P I N G me to a solid ground 

In the corner is the shelf I built
Our soaps and shampoos stacked
On three levels, slimy
With soap scum I haven’t scrubbed
Off yet.

That is still the same.

On the other side is the curtain
My sister and I hung
To contain the water, to hold the heat,
The curtain is still the same,
The same from when we strung it, strung out
At midnight over a year ago
So you could take a shower.
No, that’s still the same.

On the wall is the slow and ever-building 
Smudge of pink from soap left over
Scumming on the side.
It’s still there, because I scrubbed a week ago
And the scum spreads everyday.
The predictable growth of ick
Is as steady as a sunrise,
So no, that’s still the same.

Something here is different.

On the wall are two hooks,
Two white solid hooks,
Stoic in their wet presence.
I hung two hooks a year ago,
A year ago in our shower, and on
The two hooks are two loofahs,
And something here is different.

A year ago: two hooks, two loofahs.
I bought it all at Walmart, and your loofah
Was black. Mine green. 
Patching together a life for us
Trying
Me crumbling and glueing and
Trying. 

Something here is different.
Two hooks, two loofahs.
Yours blue, mine green.
Yours blue
Yours blue
Something here is different 

But something is the same
And it’s the C R U S H I N G,
The lonely, the “am I even here?” 

And I’m patching and crumbling and
Glueing and crumbling and
Breaking and dying and
Alone.

And you have a blue loofah.
And I am feeding a black hole.

DAE experience cyclical mood changes?,15,mg2e4m,2,"So I've been tracking my mood with apps and I realized I'll have a few good days, I'll feel optimistic and then I'll have a sharp decline in mood. It's like day and night. When I'm down I'm extremely down. Splitting on my partner, suicidal thoughts, deep depression, pushing people away, even splitting on friends, not wanting to go out and staying in bed etc. And i can't figure out what causes it. Sometimes i can link it to a certain event but usually in my better days i would be able to handle an event like that. So even though throughout the day my moods shift fast as well it isnt as intense as this. Does anyone else experience this? Its like 2 steps forward one step back every time."
My boyfriend and other women,3,mg1wfk,6,"I am jealous as hell. It is so deeply ingrained in me that... I don't even know how to solve it (I am in therapy for a year but I am far from solving it, if at all).

My boyfriend is cool. He is good with people, including women. As I perceived he seems to have more or less superficial relationships mainly with women. He knows a lot of pretty women. He was ""buddies"" with young (10 years younger), pretty women from his company. He has close, pretty female friends. He also has some average female friends, but really, 70% is attractive.

You know, I kinda trust him that he wouldn't betray me. Regardless it makes me so fucking uncomfortable that he has so many pretty females he knows. I barely know handsome guys and I don't really have guy friends.

&#x200B;

What could be the reason for this that he somehow gets close with all these women? He is not too self-aware and he says it just happens but I wonder whether it is an ego-boost for him or what.

He also casually kept in touch with some ex and fuckbuddy, sending her some sex joke. We almost broke up because he told me he won't stop talking to people just because of me.

He kinda did after a while though. But he made it clear that he will keep in touch with his closer (attractive) female friends. Since then I have constant anxiety, nightmares, and really bad physical symptoms.

&#x200B;

What can be done in such a situation? I feel like I cannot leave him yet I am being destroyed by the fucking women who he knows. I also feel like a loser that I don't even have male friends or talk to males much even though I am attractive. And my (average-looking, but for me superhot) boyfriend's contact is full with pretty females.

Uh."
This happens a LOT to me,20,mg1vir,4,"DAE switch back and forth between loving and being repulsed and disgusted by affection? Either from someone else or even myself. I'll have moments where I can be super sweet and show light affection to people or sometimes even be flirty but then I always get a mood swing where I'm just disgusted by the way I acted or stuff I said or how I felt. It's like I try and suppress it or something. I could never, and haven't, felt disgusted by these feelings towards my FP but with other people it tends to be VERY on and off. Sometimes it happens several times a day. Anyone else experience this?"
What led you to getting your diagnosis?,2,mg18fc,9,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm just curious on how one gets to the subject of personality disorders, or just bdp in general, when seeing a professional?

I've been told by people with bpd to at least look into the condition and talk about it with someone. I am absolutely not out to self diagnose, that's the last thing I'd want to do. And I know that the symptoms can overlap with other disorders, making it difficult to diagnose. But I can't get over that I see so much of myself in the diagnosis and that I'm especially struggling with handling emotions and extreme fears of abandonment. 

I'm really scared that if I bring something new into my conversations with professionals it will make them think that I'm purely out to seek attention. I already have a very difficult time making people believe what I say.

So to anyone who has been professionally diagnosed, what was your journey towards a diagnosis like? How do I bring this subject into a conversation without being looked down upon? I just want to get this out of the way no matter if I actually end up having it or not."
Update!,8,mg16y1,3,"It's been a long and introspective few months. I dumped my long term boyfriend in November, I'd get jealous of him for hanging out with his friends, I'd yell at him for not texting me back immediately, and I'd accuse him of anything and everything wrong in my life. But I realize now that a lot of my resentment was self inflicted and I took out a lot of my problems on him, it wasn't fair to him and it wastn healthy for me either. I know that now in reality he really did love me and he was looking out for me by staying with me through all the shit I gave him. I wasn’t seeing straight at the time and I realize now that I really did love him too. No other guy has made me feel so content in my life. I've had lots of time alone to think about things and let out my emotions and I've even learned to love myself in the process. Spending time alone has been a very healing experience for me. Thank you to those who have helped me realize the benefits of therapy and treatment. BPD is a bitch but Im so happy to say we're back together now and I wanted to share this story as inspiration for those who have been hurt or have hurt someone Make sure to get help whenever you find yourself idealizing and devaluing in relationships and stay with the people that love you ❤️"

DAE Have a theme for each session in therapy?,2,mfzr1q,6,"Rather than talking about your week and how that was, does anyone have specific ideas that you both explore? I was talking with my therapist today, and we both felt like we were in a car and I was asking to go to certain places then suddenly wanting to go somewhere else, meaning I have 101 issues and trying to talk about them all is impossible and makes me feel frustrated. So instead, we decided to pick the themes Self Compassion and Self Soothing since they are the root of the problem which we will talk about next time. 

I think I'll be a little disappointed that I will no longer share what's been going on with me with her but I guess therapy is for working on things rather than venting (or at least, that's I've been doing and it hasn't worked)"

It seemed like everything was good and that we were on the same page but he has asked to slow things down. Says we don't need to act like we are getting married next week (and I completely understand that). I just feel a little blind sided and confused. How do I feel like he isn't leaving or like he doesn't want to? How do I be comfortable with taking things slower? He can't completely explain what slower looks like.

I don’t want to be made a fool. I truly love them and would never hurt them in the ways I imagine them hurting me.
I could never look them in the eye, then run Into someone else’s arms. I could never cheat on them or lie about having feelings for someone else.
Why can’t I always believe this person? Why does my gut make me question them. It’s little innocuous, micro disturbances that my brain is scanning.
I have to push it down and reason it away. Reasoning your feelings..."

Feeling guilty,3,mfye6d,3,"Pushed my friend group away n most of them dont matter thaaat much to me except for 1 friend i really love. I felt like she hated me and so naturally i picked up on any and all signs that supported that theory. Prior to my diagnosis i would never have questioned whether my interpretation was valid and likely would have started an argument w her about her not willing to admit that she has a problem w me. 

Anyway so i’ve been isolating myself for the past couple of weeks because i felt unwanted and truly believed she hated me but today she texted me saying “i miss you how are you” and now i feel so bad for just being cold/distant when it was likely in my head that she had a problem with me. 

I feel so embarrassed and kind of weird about going back to being around them now. Would it be easier to explain that i have bpd n that’s why i have a tendency to pick up on the negative energy more than the positive or neutral? I don’t think i want to though because i don’t want her to think different of me or treat me like a ‘charity case’ as some people do. Idk i just feel so stupid for being so upset the past couple of weeks when i probably did not have a legitimate reason to be. Is this toxic of me?"

Like I keep overthinking and thinking back to how I acted and how I talked to her over the past few weeks or so and questioning if I was saying the wrong things or coming across in a way that would make her stop loving me as much. 

Things like her not sending me big long love notes like she did at the start of our relationship are getting to me and making me really paranoid that she doesn’t feel the same anymore. I have a meltdown last week over this and said to her that I feel like she loves me less or that I’m making her love me less and she assured me that wasn’t the case and stuff but I still have these feelings and it’s making me really depressed and just want to lie in bed all day."

"Bf and I broke up, but it's more like a break? I'm not sure how to react?? losing my mind",2,mfxr4m,1,"My boyfriend (well ex now) had a tumultuous relationship. It started off on the wrong foot, but there was a lot of love and passion there. We truly believe we are each others 'one'. We had to break up due to needing to both grow individually and heal from some relationship hurts we've caused one another.  At the time of the break up, I suggested a break and he said no. A break up makes it feel like we are severing the ties of the old relationship and aren't bound to one another... It was in essence a way to walk away from the old and hopefully start something new one day.

We tried no contact, didn't work. We couldn't stay away from one another. He then said he rather go on a break, but I didn't want that... I wanted the break up too... He's told me countlessly that he isnt using this time to move on. He wants to be better for himself and be better for me, but I keep taking it as he will move on...forget about me...realize he no longer loves me... he's trying to manipulate me to hang on only for him to move on knowing he has me as a backup...my thoughts are racing and I dont know what's real and what's an exaggeration. He was so loving and affectionate and showed me he missed me last week...this week he's a bit distanced. He said it's because he's sick (got hit hard with allergies), but I still feel sensitive and don't want to believe him...my mind just goes straight into paranoid thinking...he's hurt me before, most of it due to my BPD and pushing him away and then him leaving because of it but, he always comes back...I'm really scared. I was doing ok with the break up last week, but I spent the weekend with him...it was really nice, we ended up getting intimate too, and now I feel broken and completely set back. We're starting no contact tomorrow for 3 - 4 weeks... I'm terrified of what's going to happen at the end of it. I keep thinking I should move on despite what he said and promised...I feel played...And idk if its because he really did or im forcing myself to believe he did...  
this is conjuring up a shit ton of abandonment issues...trust issues...self esteem issues. it makes me feel unlovable, gullible, replaceable, worthless, meaningless...like i'll never be good enough. This shit is invoking a panic attack :("

If I like singing, which I do, I feel like my identity has to be “the singer” to put it really dramatically. and I have to constantly make that aspect of my personality my whole identity. If i dont feel like singing a certain night, Ill think that i’m completely over the hobby as a whole instead of just saying “maybe i dont feel like it tonight” 

Its the same with any other hobby, personality trait that I have. I also feel very superficial. Like sometimes I’ll act a certain way because I want to come across as a certain identity, wether that be trendy, e-boy, nerdy, etc. And it affects how I see other people too.

so yeah basically find out the people who can “ deal “ with it. not take it personally. who will understand. and yeah. some ppl who haven’t been through shit will not be able to understand or fully grasp it. they might get overwhelmed by our repetitive bad actions. that doesn’t mean they don’t care. they just can’t handle it. and that’s totally okay. it’s not our fault and not theirs.

"My bestfriend split on me, she finally texted me yesterday telling me she had a nightmare about me :(",2,mfu6x6,0,After about a month of no contact she finally texted me back yesterday telling me she had a dream where I was hurting her and locked the door and told her she couldn’t leave :( she said she was screaming and crying in the dream. I told her It’s her subconscious being affected it’s not her fault I told her she knows the real me the person who talked to her every day and spent time with her held her when she was crying and gave her so much love and cuddles 🥺 I told her I only want to be part of her good dreams not her nightmares. I’m honestly glad she communicated with me for the first time in basically a month after the split but it makes me sad she was scared and hurt in her dream because of me :(
Unexpected and Effective Resource for my BPD Management,14,mftrmj,4,"(Female, age 30, married with one 3.5 year old daughter. Prescribed 300mg Wellbutrin XL, and have completed both CBT (didn't help a ton) and DBT (helped somewhat), and regularly see a counselor and psychiatrist.)

It's so hard to master emotional management, since it's something we SHOULD have been taught as children. Just like learning a new language, it's easy for kids, and a nightmare for adults.

In my DBT course, they tried to teach us how to 'distract' ourselves from our moods. My husband might go take a long hot bath if he is stressed. If I tried the same, I'd simply be feeling stressed out... except I'd be in a bathtub instead. A nice walk? I'd still be stressed out, except I'm now outside. I have a hard time getting self-care to boost my mood.

I had an emotionally neglectful mother who punished me for any display of negative moods. Being upset was 'inappropriate'. Stop that. We aren't discussing anything else until you're not upset. (Spoiler alert, even after the mood has past, no one re-visits the 'problem')

Instead of reading material designed for adults with mood disorders, I ended up reading two parenting books:

1. How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, and Listen So Kids Will Talk (Adele Faber)
2. The Explosive Child (Ross Greene)

These books teach you how to teach *children* how to manage tough situations. Since it's designed to teach young children, the material is *so* basic, simple and straightforward.  I ended up picking up TONS of communication tricks and tips that 100% work with my own moods.

Both books talk about how to use simple, but creative, problem solving. Because children, let alone stressed children, aren't very good at complex solutions. So the methods in the books are SO SIMPLE and EASY TO USE."
DAE get really bad around their period?,190,mftk18,30,"Tw for suicide mention

As a kid I would be prone to more sensitivity during it, but these last two years or so the violent downshift of my mood during that week is absolutely insane. 

Yesterday admist the stomach pain and dysphoria (added bonus of being trans ✌) I went slingshotting from feeling emotionally fine to having such heavy suicidal thoughts I impulsively posted about them where folks I personally know could see them, something I NEVER do. And it sucka extra because I was doing so good for a couple weeks, coping well with everything. 

I did see some studies on how symptoms can worsen with the influx of everything happening in your body, but goddamn this is already a week I really don't look forward to, why does it have to reinforce my shitty emotions and make them even worse :/

Editing to just say:  I'm very glad I made this thread because I truly thought the severe emotions was just typical mood swing period stuff and only today learned that it's considered a legit disorder. So thank you everyone for bringing it to light for me!"
It’s long but I really need some advice from someone who can actually relate..,2,mftj0h,0,"

About 4 years ago after being diagnosed with severe depression and a burnout, I was diagnosed with bpd when I started therapy. I had a bad experience with my first therapist and therefore completely discarded the diagnosis because I felt like they fucked up. 
A psychiatrist later diagnosed me again but since I had already decided it wasn’t true, I just put it aside and pretended it never happened. 

I’m in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years now and have always been very fond of him. A few issues came up on my part; trauma, massive intimacy issues, etc. He’s very supportive and understanding and I really felt I had found my person with him. We’ve been in a weird situation lately, we had to move back in with our parents after losing our house and now since 2-3 months he has found a job here and is living with me at my dad’s house. There’s a lot of pressure and stress on this situation and I’ve tried my hardest to fix it. It’s been hard but at least we’re together. 

A few weeks ago I lost my job as well and it worsened my mental state even more. I made a post on r4r cause I felt like making a friend and having the world seem a bit bigger (I’m assuming I did this as a means of escape). I started talking with someone and we still are. I haven’t told my boyfriend. I wanted but this person has sort of expressed an interest in me and now I feel like I can’t say anything cause it’ll look bad and hurt him. All I know is I’m enjoying talking to this person and I don’t know want to stop. I just hate myself for getting in these kind of situations all the time and doing something that might possibly hurt my bf. 

I’ve always had the feeling that if someone liked me, I must have manipulated them into doing so and this came up while talking to this Reddit person. It reminded me of the diagnosis I got years ago and it suddenly hit me; they were absolutely right. I’ve been reading about it and the more I did the clearer it became but I’m really struggling to accept it. 
When I’m in a bad state of mind and feel trapped, I start dissociating and I’m afraid I’m splitting on my boyfriend. 
I really don’t want to cause I was really happy with him but it feels irreversible. 
I’m constantly spending my time alone and telling him I need to be alone cause I’m struggling. When I am spending time with him I feel on edge and a massive pressure to be cuddly or lovey dovey (which I simply am not so much as a person but it’s getting worse now) and it’s fueling the splitting. 

I’m really quite new to the bpd thing and what it actually means. Is this relationship doomed? Is it just my state of mind causing this or did I just fall out of love? Should I maybe not be in a relationship at all? I know I’m not exactly being very clear about what’s bothering me but I’m hoping to get some advice or talk to someone that has had similar experiences. 
I’m too much in my head and I can’t explain it to anyone. I’m really afraid I’m gonna hurt someone again."
A metaphor for BPD recovery.,19,mfthcx,4,"At one point I was part of a crew, a family of behaviors, who roamed the oceans. We were a pirate crew. We had no home of our own except the ship that we sailed on.

We tied ourselves up to other ships when we came across them. We would dress ourselves up so we didn't appear threatening and for a time we would sail, tied to these other boats. The boats tied together were safer. They weathered storms because they were wider. We shared provisions. We relied on each other.

The issue, however, is that my crew and I were pirates. We had been raised in a way that meant that all we knew was the pirate life. We didn't know how to be a ship that was self-sustaining like the ones we tied up to.

Slowly but surely over time the ships we tied on to would realize that we were masquerading. 

Our pirate guise would become visible during a storm or when resources became stretched. If we sensed that the other ship was going to uncover us we would hack and slash and burn the connections that kept the ships together and sail away, leaving the other ship to wallow and recover.

Sometimes we'd see a new ship on the ocean. Bright and shiny and not worn down like the one we had slowly aged. In the night we'd sail over to the new ship, leaving a skeleton ship in place to fool the original one.

One day, standing on the bow of the ship I looked around and the fog that was often on this ocean cleared a little. Maybe it was the light, maybe it was the breeze, maybe I looked a little bit harder than usual.

All around me I saw ships that my crew had harmed. They were the same ships they had been, but with subtle differences.

Some no longer caught the wind in their sails like they used to. On some, their colors were faded. Others had erected protective barriers around them or invested heavily in weapons to keep them safe.

This ocean hadn't been like this before…it had only become this way because of us.

I turned to my crew and implored to them that we needed to change our ways, but they refused. Time went by and I witnessed more casualties and eventually I decided that this was not my crew. I could be somewhere else. I longed for seas where the sun glistened off clear waves.

I confronted my crew once again and begged for change, but they revolted on me. If I wanted change, I would have to leave the ship. They would give me no provisions, no boat, no support…If I wanted to leave, I could leave and swim for land. Or I could stay. 

There was no land in sight. I had never even seen land.

If I left, I would be swimming away from the ship into an open ocean. I would have to swim past ships who would look at me and laugh at me. Ships that would not pick me up if I were floundering.

For weeks I didn't sleep. My crew was all I had ever known. They were my family. I didn't even know how long I could swim for.

One day the crew broke away from another ship. What was once lovely and fair was left battered and broken, limping back to a port far away. My crew laughed and jeered and started looking for a new ship.

Standing on the deck I watched that ship sail away and resolved to never let that situation happen again.

I knew I couldn't swim very well so I decided to learn. I read at night while my crew mocked me. I learned everything I could about how to survive in an ocean alone. I confronted the fear and the risks and decided that swimming for shore was better than staying on board the boat with this sick crew. The mist had started to clear in recent weeks and as a result I could see the never-ending horizon. The enormity of the challenge was intimidating but it also helped me mentally prepare for what appeared to be an impossible task ahead.

Then one day, with my crew mocking and jeering me, some of them pleading with me to not leave, I stood on the end of the plank and stared over the ocean towards a land mass that I couldn't even imagine.

Many of the crew pleaded with me that they would die without me. Some willed me on, knowing that I would fail and swim back to the boat, where I would be even more of a hostage.

Finally, I thought of the broken ships and my resolve to never be part of creating another one and I dived overboard.

As I hit the ocean's surface the fear caught me and took my breath away…I couldn't do it. The ship was a safe harbor, there is nothing for me out here in an ocean that is threatening to swallow me up. 

I tread water, desperately wanting to climb back on board but I soon noticed that treading water was ok. I continued to tread water, listening to the pleas of my crew, until I felt like I could move away from the boat.

Turning my back to the ship and crew I had known all my life I took a deep breath and started swimming strong yet still uncertain strokes towards a horizon that didn't end, and a shore that might not exist."
Having a hard time..,3,mftdkg,0,"I think I'm about to ""relapse"" with SH...

I can’t stand anything touching me when triggered ?,39,mfsuh7,8,Someone at work triggered me and I’m so deep in my head.

Has the pandemic upended anyone else's marriage?,3,mfsp5w,4,"Been happily married for 5 years. But this last year is different. We're both working full time from home and taking turns with childcare. It's been so god awful on my bpd. I am feeling smothered, needy, angry, hypercritical of myself and my spouse, with even more severe anxiety and depression. I am full of internal rage or fatigue so often, and just so easily triggered into catastrophic or dangerous thoughts. I love my spouse and think we can pull through, but my brain continues devaluing him and blaming things on him. It's been a long time since I've had a single day without intrusive thoughts.

I really think this is happening because of the pandemic. It's forced us into this unnatural situation of being together, at home, 247. Marriage is forever, but it's not 247! I'm trying to take responsibility for my negative thoughts and trying to improve my mood but it's so damn difficult under these circumstances."
ADHD & BPD,2,mfsn33,3,"Does anyone else diagnosed with ADHD &amp;amp; BPD struggle figuring out which disorder is fueling certain symptoms?

There’s so much overlap with both disorders:
- Poor emotional regulation
- mood swings
- bad concept of time
- impulsivity
- rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)
- high rates of self harm 
- difficultly maintaining tasks that lack immediate reward
- outbursts
- high reactivity

The list goes on and on. I struggle being able to tell which disorder is affecting what and I often think they just work together to amplify certain symptoms. I want to be able to discern what is the root of certain symptoms so I have the ability to better navigate treatment options. 

I have bad reactions to all medications so it’s important for me to take a little as possible. If the BPD is affecting me the most I will learn to live with the side effects of mood stabilizers but if it’s ADHD I would want to learn to live with the side effects of stimulants. I cannot have side effects from both or I’ll be too sick."
Feel bad when FP does stuff without you,2,mfs9it,2,"I always find myself getting upset and pushing my FP and all my friends away when my FP does stuff without me.

This could be small stuff like talking to new people, making new friends, being active online but won’t text me
.... or it can be bigger like they tell me how they are moving in with others and seeing them in a temporary relationship. 

I don’t want this to keep affecting our friendship and I feel so bad for thinking like this all the time. I care about them and I want them to be happy, so why am I so upset about them finding what makes them happy.

... is it my fear of abandonment and fear of people never being able to be happy with me?

I would love to know how others cope with splitting like this with their FP because it is so exhausting loving them and thinking they are the best person ever who loves being around you and cares about you... just to feel like they are evil and hate you the next day because you saw them do something without you."
The Dr is spoke to said its highly likely I have bpd...,2,mfs54n,5,"But, he also suggested it could be cPTSD...I'm so confused! I also have 2 questions at the bottom, and I'm really hoping this kind of post is allowed , and I, so sorry if its not. I'm just confused and am looking for if anyone else has experienced this problem,..

Basically he said he's gonna send me some links for cPTSD and to look at them and then next week he'd call me again and discuss which one I feel like fits me better and go from there about getting a diagnosis...but on first look...BPD and cPTSD have similar symptoms and I related to a lot of them for both disorders. How to am I supposed to know which one is me? I guess the distinction is trauma, right? But I don't understand how the things I've been through even count as trauma but apparently I said things that made him think otherwise enough to suggest it? 

 Has anyone dealt with the same problem? Or does anyone know any symptoms that would distinguish the 2 enough that I can decide which one I think fits better?

Currently my gut is saying bpd, but what the Dr said has thrown me off and I'm so unsure

And question 2...what do I do now with a potential diagnosis? Do I tell people? Do I hide it? I'm kind of scared but also kind of want to know bc it will be a relief to know but also scared. Idk what's supposed to happen after a diagnosis of something or how I'm supposed to feel about it. Do I carry on as normal? Idk what to do with myself"
I’m more comfortable with people who don’t like me/are using me,2,mfs3s1,1,"DAE find themselves more comfortable when people you love don’t like you? When people like me, I get anxious. I constantly question it, and doubt it, and they have to prove themselves time and time again, repeatedly, forever, and it’s still not enough sometimes. It’s stressful, and it’s one of the main reasons I’ve switched to full on avoidant and stopped having social interactions altogether. I’ve had multiple times where I’ve straight up told people things like “if you just want to use me for money/an emotional punching bag/sex (even though I’m very asexual and hate sex)/whatever I don't mind, just let me know! 😊” because I feel like that would genuinely be easier for me.

I mean, I do like being liked by people, I really *really* do, the high parts of that high-low cycle feel amazing, but the lows are unbearable to the point where sometimes I feel like I’d rather just at least know where I stand. (Although I also get sad when they actually do just use me (which is especially silly because like obviously if you talk constantly about how easy you are to use people are going to end up using you? duh). It’s more secure and ""comfortable"", but it’s still disappointing.) The more it starts to look like a friend is using me for money, the less happy I am, but the less anxious I am too. If people refuse to let me buy them things I freak out, because then I feel like “well what can I bring to the table then? How am I supposed to be useful and prove my worth to you if I can’t buy you things?”

And I mean, the one relationship I’ve felt most secure in was one I *knew* with absolute certainty I was being used and manipulated. She lied and said she cared, but she was a bad liar, so I never stressed about whether or not it was true because I *knew* it wasn’t, and I never wondered whether I would mess up somehow and make her stop liking me because she never liked me in the first place. Our “romance” was basically transactional, so as long as I played my part and gave her the things that were expected of me then she’d have no reason to get rid of me. Even now, even after she betrayed me in one of the worst ways possible, I still miss that comfortable feeling sometimes.

Is this a BPD thing? Anyone else relate?"

freaking out i hate my life,1,mfqyk3,0,"Tw: suicide
...
my best friend has started hanging out all the time with my roommate. it got to the point where whenever me and my friend were trying to chill together and we never could get any 1 on 1 time because my roommate was always butting in. then we'd be hanging out and my friend and roommate would just kind of ignore me when i would try to be a part of the conversation. and the past few days ive been not talking to wither of them. yesterday i almost blew up at my friend when he told me he loved me. i had to hold myself back bc i was crying and knew if i said more i was gonna start a bad fight. i just told him that i didnt fucking care and to leave me alone. i keep wanting to apologize, but when i try, i see them hanging out without me AGAIN. 
i've been feeling really replaceable and worthless lately and i told my friend this and right after telling him that all this shit started happening. like he didnt even care. 

i know i sound clingy and crazy af, but i just told my roommate a week or so ago that sometimes it feels like my best friend is my only friend bc i have a lot of friends, but none check in on me or are there for me when i need them like my best friend. we bonded over shared trauma and mental illness, so we've always like been there for each other. now i just feel so alone and sad and angry. i feel like my roommate is trying to replace me in my life. like whats the point of me even being alive if she can just come around and kick me out of my friendships and support system. 

i know i sound delusional and i'm probably just being crazy for no reason and its the bpd talking, but i just fucking hate her i want to scream at both of them i want to snap. i want them to know what theyre doing to me. 

i'm so tired of caring about people so much more than they care about me. i just want to feel like i belong somewhere or like someone gives a fuck about me.

my birthday is in 3 days and i can't spend another year alone crying, but thats how its looking. i just want to be dead. i dont care anymore i dont want to live. theres no fixing my life, theres no reason for me to keep living on this earth in pain."
Currently struggling.,1,mfqr41,0,"I have been struggling with how I have been feeling for the past 2 weeks. I have spoken to the Dr's and they want me to go back onto my meds (escitalopram and seroquel). I really don't want to go back on my meds but given how I am currently feeling I guess I probably should. I just don't want to feel tired/emotion-less zombie all of the time.

I also have never had any symptoms of BPD explained to me, I was just given a diagnosis and no real way to deal with my symptoms. I eat well, exercise regularly and try to keep a consistent routine but always seem to end up feeling like this"
How can we go about finding a healthy relationship?,1,mfqnq5,3,"I am feeling seriously defeated today. I took a year off of dating to try and find happiness on my own and I found the old me, from years ago, who loved to find small towns and get a coffee. Drive to no where to take pictures. Find cute stores. Explore. I found new friends, ditched some toxic ones. I read a LOT. I finally felt ready. 

I found what I thought would be good where I least expected it: a friendship. We started getting friendly, then got physical, and I wasn't really sure what I wanted at first. I wanted to take it slow as hell, and it was going that way for a bit until something felt uneasy. I decided to lurk a bit and while I couldn't point to a ""fact"" before last night, I thought there was someone else. Last night it was confirmed after he was going to see his cousin that he was in fact seeing a girlfriend of three years that, in our 10 year friendship, he never mentioned once. I am sick to my stomach. Besides the fact that it destroys a foundation of friendship by cutting off trust, how disrespectful after having a talk about unprotected sex to LIE. He knows I have been working on some of my own issues, he knows my past relationship issues, and he played me like the rest of them. and SO smoothly. I am working on how I should cut it off now, if I should even tell the girl, etc.

But this is a freaking pattern. My last ex was a chronic cheater, refused to commit, and treated me like trash. Before that, I had an abusive relationship with a guy who constantly threatened me, made me work for his approval and if I did any less than 120% I would hear about it. There was also the drunk who cheated on me for the last half of our relationship. The guy who blamed my lack of religion on why our relationship went no where only for him to marry a girl from a different background.

I went around for years thinking I was unlovable. It really got hard and I did get desperate. I finally felt like I wasn't desperate, that I was looking for love in a right place, and instantly end up with another story for the books. I would have been okay if he hadn't lied to my face, if maybe he just refused to see me or sleep with me or even cut me off, but he is creating a whole false narrative. WTF!

I think I have to break from dating again. What the hell am I doing wrong? Why am I dragging these people in? I thought I found love in myself and I feel a lot more confident, but I am getting walked over, again."
emotional regulation & recognizing signs before chaos ensues,3,mfqerx,2,"when I’m becoming emotionally dysregulated, it’s hard for me to know until I’ve split and done something detrimental to my life or relationship. this has always been a problem, but I’m more aware of the pattern in my behavior now. I want to notice when I’m feeling dysregulated, take the space to get myself back on track, and come back. I think it’s hard because when I’m dysregulated, it’s usually out of fear and I want to create some sort of clingy chaos with the person I’m afraid of losing. and in those moments, I’m so sure that “breaking up” or hang out immediately is the best thing to do to soothe, but it’s usually not. it’s something I have to do on my own, but I don’t know when to trust myself.

how do you realize you’re not emotionally centered? are there physical signs? emotional signs? how do you know when you’re acting on emotion and not being rational, more wise mind & emotional mind work, I assume? any tips, stories, etc will help. thank you."

I understand why he did it, I kept sabotaging the relationship, kept breaking up with him and then begging him to take me back, but he’s finally had enough and I understand. But it hurts so damn much.
I can’t talk to friends because I already broke up with him last month and never told them we got back together. I don’t know what to do anymore, I just don’t understand why I’m this messy fucked up person.

Friendships and FPs - I want one to stay,0,mfp0ki,2,"I don't know if this is really an FML post or Relationships (maybe even vent). 

I'm a 43 year old male, diagnosed about 2 years. With the benefit of hindsight I now recognize I have had a series of FPs throughout my life. 

The first one that really stuck was my ""best friend"" in high school. I went through a couple I'm not proud of including a coworker I had an affair with. Not knowing the strong feelings were partly because of mental illness. 

I don't want to turn this into a novel. I don't understand how friendships are to work. Basics like how often to talk. How to not be the one reaching out all the time 

I miss being someone else's FP. I wish my wife were my FP, it would make life so much easier. 

I have one IRL friend left that I went to high school with. The remaining acquaintances are all people like the partners of my wife's friends. I have a few online friends, but only one I can confide in about almost everything. 

I think this is a vent. I'll stop here.

The BPD diagnosis prevented me from getting proper health care.,14,mfok4l,5,"Hi,  


I'm really scared to write here, I'm really looking for a safe space to write down my experiences. I'm begging you all, if I say something wrong. Please tell me!  


I got my BPD diagnosis in 2011/2012. I was with a bad boyfriend back then who abused me in every way possible. But mostly gaslighting, emotional abuse and threats of harm/abandonment. I can fully see WHY I got the diagnosis back then. I was a hot mess. Almost ticked off every box of the DSM-5. My (now ex) boyfriend had a firm grip on my treatment. Went with me every time. And somehow all the fights that I talked about were turned around back on me. To the point that even my therapist was agreeing with my ex that I deserved what he gave me. 

I fell in love with someone else... ended things with my ex (cleanly if I say so myself) gave myself a few months to recuperate and started a new thing with the new guy. The coping mechanisms I had formed during my previous relationship stayed..  I was always on my guard. Got pretty isolated because my friends were his friends (we met through mutual friends). After an semi inpatient stay in an eating disorder clinic, I was told I did NOT have BPD. There was something, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it. (more on this later) Some additional testing had to be done. A letter of referral would be send to my GP. (this letter never arrived). After the treatment I went to a new school and literally all my symptoms disappeared. I became my own person. Made my own friends. Unfortunately this meant that me and my then boyfriend were drifting apart. We had different interests. And after an argument about where we were gonna live, he told me to choose between him and the house. I chose the house. 

Fast forward and I find my current husband. And we just clicked. I love the guy to bits, and of course I miss him when he is gone. (which he rarely is due to covid now. so that's gonna take some getting used to once restrictions get lifted). But I just do my thing when he was gone. I even enjoyed the me time since it gave me time to do the stuff that I liked and he didn't. 

2016 I had a surgery that left me disabled. My rehabilitation failed immensely and I was in constant pain. I did NOT get taken seriously. I've recently looked over my medical files. And they literally put in my file that they gave me an MRI to just shut me up (I had an extra surgery to get this MRI since some surgical screws had to be taken out). that my pain was out of proportion. I was called all but a hypochondriac. in 2018 it turned out that my main muscle next to the surgery site was so severely agitated that it got so knotted that I indeed could not stretch or lift my limb without pain. I've since been treated for that, and I am happy to say that I am pain free.

In 2017 I developed some physical issues besides the pain because I gained a lot of weight. I got edema in my left ankle/foot. And I don't know why. but my brain fixated on that thing. I developed a severe anxiety disorder centred around my  ankle. I went to my GP asking her for help. My GP referred me to a BPD center. To which I replied. ""I don't have BPD its been taken out of my file since 2014"". My GP said I did have it, so I either take this treatment or I take the high way. I left the office with a mark in my file that I refused treatment.

A year later I found out (with a medical professional) that I am autistic. Which explained all my difficulty in life. My GP on the other hand refused to put autism in my file. She did it reluctantly in the end. But my main diagnosis is still BPD.

I'm now 3 (almost 4) years further. I still have not received treatment for my anxiety. my life has started to become very limited due to the anxiety growing out of proportion. I'm hitting road blocks left and right when it concerns my medical care. Everything comes back to the BPD. If I twist my ankle and am in pain? Must be the BPD. I have a lump in my breast and I'm worried? Must be the BPD.  I've now been marked ""mentally complex"" and in my country it means mental health treatment stops here. No psychologist will ever touch me. 

Im not sure what I'm asking for here, I'm mostly asking for support. Some love. But this diagnosis unfortunately made my life really difficult if not impossible. And whats worse is that its not an accurate diagnosis."
DAE have problems with perception of time?,10,mfnkar,1,"Sorry if this is a weird question. I've been having problems recently with my perception of time - hours feel like days, days feel like weeks, etc. - and I wondered if it was a BPD thing. It's mostly an issue when I'm left alone / have no one to talk to / feel like I haven't spoken to a friend in *ages* (then realise it's only been a few hours / a day or two). If anyone has any advice on how to manage this sort of thing, that would be appreciated as well, but it's okay if not!"
Today's a good day,10,mfn65a,6,"After living with financial struggles for months, i finally got a job!! 

The last few weeks were horrible, i struggled with abandonment issues, suicidal thoughts, paranoia that nobody cares about me, the classics...

Additional to that, i had no money. I lived from bill to bill and then one of my rabbits got sick... 500$ vet bill. I borrowed the money from mom and a friend, but i hate debts so i paid it back asap. But then i ended up with no money. I went grocery shopping with coins i found at home... 

but thats over now!! I'm so happy!!

BTW: I applied for like 30 jobs, already had one and had to quit, i started to apply again.. things take time and patience."
Quiet bpd getting loud,0,mfn5ri,12,"TW: mentions of negative stereotypes that society associates with bpd.

Okay so I’m 19F and I have bpd, I got diagnosed with bpd when I was around 17. But I guess you could say I existed/exist on the more quiet end of the spectrum. What I mean to say is that I’m mostly “functional” or whatever and I often don’t have explosive episodes, i implode. My thought patterns can be erratic and all of that but I’m not expressive. Anyway I’ve read a lot on bpd and there’s a lot of negative attributes that most people associate with bpd and I think a part of me internalized all of those. To the point where when I mention I have bpd i often say “but I’m not the typical borderline, I’m like normal mostly” which is really messed up of me but I guess I just want to dissociate myself from the disorder as much as I possibly can. The truth is though I think my bpd is becoming less quiet. And i find myself doing things that are the stereotypical negative things that society associates with bpd. And it’s like I’m watching myself completely obliterate my relationships and manipulate people and I’d even go as far as to say be emotionally abusive and I can’t stop myself. It’s almost like someone else is doing all of those things but that person is me. I’m holding myself accountable and everything but at the same time it’s hard because I’m supposed to be getting better but instead I feel like I’m getting worse. I just don’t really know what do anymore and it’s like no one in my life sees me/gets it. So I’m probably just going to detach from everyone and self-isolate."
SO shuts me out or feel annoyed when I tell him I am suicidal.,1,mfm8hd,2,"Apologize for my grammar or spelling in advance.

I have been denying this fact for a loooong time. But I have to accept and acknowledge that it is one of my triggers.

He thinks that just because I am suicidal and not thankful I am alive and breathing = not happy/ satisfied with our relationship.

I am happy with our relationship, it's one of the reasons why I try so so hard to better myself, to accept myself radically and be mindful of my actions, it has been so hard the first few months, I have to admit, I've been toxic just to get reassurance from him. IT'S hard as hell to contradict these core values in my head that I grew up in, to be kind to myself, to unlearn the defense mechanisms I have learned because of my past, it's hard af and I know you guys here understand this. 

My SO may not be perfect, there's flaws in our relationship, there's things he might say and I get triggered but he says sorry and now always takes caution in every single word he says, but sometimes I just break, I just forget my reason in life, I don't see any future in it, I feel hopeless, ultimately I feel like death is the ultimate answer, no matter how hard I try, I sometimes go back to this and whenever I try to communicate this to my SO, I get coldness and being shut off, he thinks I don't want him in my life, that US is not enough for me to continue living. I love him and our relationship, but sometimes I fail and go back into my old thinking and I just want him to be there and meet me and not just walk away and leave me. I feel abandon whenever he does that and just brings back lots of bad stuff. He tells me that he loves me for being vulnerable but the truth is I only told him about my past, just the surface, the reasons why I am the way I am, and he lovingly accepted it and he was wonderful. But the real emotions that came with it? How I hate I have ever been born? How I'm never really thankful I'm breathing or how I'm suicidal... I chose not to cause I think it will just throw me off my progress, but I wish he would acknowledge it, that the girl he's loving comes with these issues too, that I can be happy with our relationship and have mental issues at the same time, I just want him there when I want to end myself but I am met with a cold shoulder and a back turned against me. 

I am planning to tell him this at once, but I am torn as to how I should open up with it as I have been really bad with communicating my vulnerable and true feeling with him as I am afraid he'll turn out cold."
"Note to myself: Boundaries are for you, not other people.",15,mfknss,2,"My goal is to lead a meaningful life in line with my values. 

I can only go so far down certain roads before I become so emotionally disregulated that I am a danger to myself and others. 

Other people may be able to go further down those roads than I can.  Good for them. They may encourage me to join them. Not good for me. 

No matter how much I want to keep walking by their side, when I see the landmarks, I have to stop. 

But here’s the thing: only I can see the landmarks.  They’re invisible to everyone else. 

So, before we get close to a landmark, I have to let people know. hey, I have some limitations that I’ll be observing to keep myself safe. 

When we’re approaching the landmark, I can point it out specifically.  ‘I can feel myself becoming disregulated. I’m going to need to [hang up/go home/take a break/come back to this conversation when I can show up in a way I can be be proud of.]

The people who are safe to be close to won’t mind at all. It’s just information to them. They may decide to stay on this side of the landmark to spend time with me, or they may decide that it’s too restrictive and they can’t work around my limitations. Whatever they decide, they will treat me with kindness, consideration, and respect.  They may not understand me, but they believe me. What they will not do is belittle me for respecting my own boundaries. 

The people who are not safe to be close to respond very differently. They will try to convince me that those landmarks aren’t really there, and that nothing bad will happen if I cross my boundaries. That I’m being dramatic. Over-reacting. Making it all about me. 

They will berate me for not walking down the road with them.  If I listen to them, and try to go past the landmarks, I will become emotionally dysregulated. At that point, I can expect to be blamed, shamed, and belittled.

They shouldn’t do any of those things. But I can’t control any of that. All I can control is what I do when I get close to a landmark."
Me and my partner will be celebrating our 3 year anniversary this week!,444,mfkjmv,46,"During the process of getting diagnosed I kept getting told that people with BPD don't usually have long term, meaningful relationships. Every time I'd say I have a boyfriend (together for 6 months at that point), the professionals would be skeptical, almost like I've made him up, or they'd say I need to leave him until I get better so I don't hurt him while I heal.

Well today, 5 weeks away from finishing DBT, we're celebrating our 3 year anniversary this Thursday. We have huge plans for the future, later this year we're hoping to be moving in together full time. We talk about marriage and weddings and kids all the time, we pretend fight over our possible last names and what we're gonna name the kids. We talk about giving my bird the best life and our future adopted pets. I've never had such in-depth conversations with anyone else about kitchen and bathroom layouts, we spent months deciding which knife set to buy.

I've never had someone accept me as me but also celebrate and acknowledge the changes and progress I've made. He doesn't see me as old me vs new me, he sees me with better skills. Even with me being non-binary and getting a binder this year, he still sees me. When I find a new hobby or interest, he listens to me rant about it with a smile on his face. He even looks at all the pictures of frogs I show him and he hates frogs.

It is possible for people with BPD to have healthy and strong relationships.

Edited to add: If someone makes a happy post, please don't shit on it by derailing the conversation to the treatment of men in mental health. If you're tired of seeing women told stories, tell your own and contribute to the class instead of complaining about the lack of men's perspectives."
Teddy bear sign,2,mfkfat,5,"I just recently read about the ""teddy bear sign"" that some mental health journals have mentioned as a potential sign of BPD. Essentially, adults with BPD get stuck in the phase of childhood when they are supposed to be transitioning out of needing objects as a form of comfort (teddy bear, blanket, doll, etc) and so these objects continue to be a significant form of comfort for an adult with BPD even in their latter years. 

What's odd to me is the object has basically been classified as something that someone with BPD uses as a relationship substitute. Something not attached to another person, but an entire entity on its own.

My experience with this objects is exactly the opposite. All of my stuffed animals that I have extreme attachment to are from someone very important to me and I actually consider that stuffed animal as that person themselves. (That's the best way I can describe it, no I don't *actually* think that person IS the stuffed animal but I equate it to them specifically.) Exp: I have a stuffed animal from my grandma and it's her. I have one from my brother and it is him. One from my husband and it's the same thing there. 

I guess, in my head, I made it this way so that I would always have access to them and always have them with me. And in past relationships when it has ended, I've thrown everything they've ever given me away, including any comfort items so I don't hold onto them if the relationship dissolves. 

Anyone else have an experience with this?"
I really need to stop buying new clothes whenever I start smth new,6,mfk8bv,1,"I’m starting a new course this week and I just dropped $200 on new clothes, a bunch of sweaters and some pants, bc starting a new thing means I have to start all over with a clean slate, I have to become a new person with a new style and I can’t have anyone know about the old me.

Anyone else have a similar problem? For me it’s anytime I start smth new, a new job, new course, anywhere where I’m going to meet new people I have to become a new person"
I caught my bf/fp cheating and idk what to do,0,mfk5dl,3,"(I'm a 22 y/o woman with bpd in a relationship with a 23 y/o man w/o bpd)

Yesterday night before work, I was feeling insecure like I have been the past couple of weeks in my relationship. We have just been bickering over the slightest things and he is always talking to me with a condescending tone of voice as of lately. He has also suddenly started acting weird, examples: I was majorly insecure one day and ""jokingly"" asked if he was cheating on me. He got super mad and I ended up feeling guilty. Then one night he went out with his best friend and didn't text me when he made it. So hours go by and I texted and asked what he was doing and he got mad and sent me a picture of him out to eat with his friend. He told me he doesn't want me checking up on him, that it's crazy, that he isn't obligated to do that and it turned into a full blown argument and so on. So, back to the point, last night he left his phone in the bathroom and I went in there to shower. I had a gut feeling to go through it so I did. I saw messages on his snapchat between this girl. In November of 2020, he commented on her snapchat story of her in a bra and said ""Thank you 😊"". And in December, he was asking her what her kid wanted for christmas as if he was going to buy her kid something.... It gets worse for me... then no saved messages at all until this month on the 7th, She posted a snap sorry of her all dressed up with a friend and he slid up on it and commented ""my forever crush"" and she replied ""thanks boo, the feeling is mutual"" and then he sent a heart and infinity emoji. A week after that he tried messaging her again saying hey which she either did not respond or messages weren't saved. I took pictures of them and sent them to my two closest friends for advice. I confronted him about it, I ended up leaving our apartment together to go see my best friend and he blew my phone up all night. I eventually went back to our apartment bc I intended on leaving him. I know it's not as bad as it could be but to me sneaky flirtatious messages can eventually lead to more! and I didn't want to put myself through the possibility of that happening. When i got home, he was frantic and crying, begging me to stay. He said that he hasn't seen her since high school and I even messaged this girl on my phone and she confirmed what he said. He has now deleted every social media except snapchat which he has removed EVERY girl. I did not even ask for that. I didn't want him to do anything bc I was going to leave. He promised to work on gaining my trust back, always checking up with me and so on. I'm sorry this is so long, I just needed to rant and get advice! I have no idea what to do! I feel stuck. I love this boy so much but I am just so hurt and betrayed. I don't know if things will ever be the same. I don't want to leave him but how can I trust him? I don't know what to do here and would love some outside input. :("
"Ruthlessly blocking people (not many of my friends understand why I do this, I know it’s not healthy)",10,mfk3n9,3,"Just another thing I thought of to address in therapy tomorrow. There are many people I’ve ruthlessly blocked and cut out of my life when they hurt me over the years. People from work, friend groups, people I’ve dated (this is the most prevalent one). I’m sure they don’t understand the pain they caused me that led me to make those decisions for the relationship. Sometimes I tried communicating and felt invalidated and after a certain point I just snap and want them gone. Sometimes I don’t realize how angry I am until someone else tells me they don’t think what that person did to me was okay. Or express shock at how I allowed them to talk to or treat me. Then I feel ashamed and angry. I have pretty low self worth despite being very outgoing and friendly. My low self worth keeps me from recognizing things I don’t like sometimes because I convince myself I’m actually the problem, and I have a passive, people pleasing communication style, often repressing my own emotions until they explode, so I feel like this has happened to me quite a bit over the years. 

Part of me knows I’m lacking empathy for them when I block them out. But it’s a response to what I perceive as their lack of empathy for me. So in that moment I feel they don’t genuinely care about me so it won’t hurt them if I disappear. (Which is not always true, often very untrue.) I just want to block the negative emotions they bring me because they’re too strong. I generally let things build up, I don’t realize until it’s the “final straw” and then I never want to speak to them again. I definitely demonize them in my mind which I know is unproductive. 

Usually later on I’ll be able to see them as neutral again and have more compassion for where they were in life that caused them to act the way they did. I’ve made amends with a few people who later reached out for forgiveness, or even I reached out after realizing some things (like projecting my complex emotions onto them) and apologize for abruptly cutting them out. 

But in the moment, it’s how I keep myself from going back to someone who has repeatedly made me question my own self worth/sanity. This is how I cope, and why I’m going to be so careful in the future about who I share my heart with. I’m finally learning to be emotionally vulnerable with myself and realize I value deep connections and have struggled because I sought after superficial ones for years to distract me from my own emptiness. Luckily I managed to find and keep some deep and genuine relationships. 

I just need to spend a lot of time on myself right now so I stop blindly heading into things without understanding what I want and need, and then getting upset when my needs aren’t met. I have been going through life looking to external validation to fill this giant void inside of me, I don’t want to do it anymore. It’s gotten to a point I feel I’ve been living to try to get validation from other people for so long I have no idea who I am. I’m struggling a lot with my sense of identity lately. It’s usually tied up in work, friends, or boyfriends. I don’t know who I am apart from people in my life and don’t know how to enjoy time alone like I used to. I want my joy and security to come internally. Just some late night thoughts, let me know if you have any to share"

I can’t stop getting mad at my boyfriend for liking other girls before me,7,mfjj1z,5,I hate thinking about the girls he used to like and getting mad at him for it.

Splitting,1,mfj17c,4,Ok so interpersonal relationships have just been smack to the face after smack to the face so consistently for the past almost year straight I'm heavily considering just becoming a hermit to avoid the pain of splitting on anyone ever again.

I want to disappear forever,3,mfirrx,0,"It’s one of those nights where I wish I never existed. I hate the fact that we are still in covid times. I feel like it just makes my symptoms flair up. Today I had a meltdown because I couldn’t lift a piece of furniture at the store and there was no one to help me. It’s little things like these that just make me feel so alone. It the kind of snowball effect that just reminds me that I’m. It worthy of friends or people being genuinely nice to me. 
I want to die because I feel like the biggest burden on anyone I meet. I feel unworthy of love. Unworthy of genuine friendships. Starting to feel like I wasn’t meant to exist. 
I don’t want to cry anymore. I just want the suffering to stop. I want to get rid of debts and fix everything inside my head but I feel like nothing helps. 
To make matters worse my engine gave out after having my car for two years. 

I’m sick and tired of the world placing all these obstacles in my path. Why does my 2 year old car have to break down so fast? Why does my boyfriend ignore me when I need constant attention? Why does my family tell me to be normal? 

It feels like every day the odds are against me and I don’t see that as a reason to keep on living."
Does anyone get night terrors from bad switches,1,mfiohp,1,"I have been stuck in a bpd episode for months and I just had a long scary ass weird dream I'm going to write it here

I went to my old neighborhood, really nice houses. Before I left some woman walked out and was talking to me, she had 2 boys with her and invited me over so I went iddk why. To get up to their house they had a weird obstacle course thing like hanging hammocks? Super not safe. When I got to the second one her son was on it so it flipped and we fell from a far ass height and I passed out on the ground

I woke up in their house with their whole family being there? No one was hurt but they kept taunting me and being rude so I wanted to leave. Which means I had to wrangle the stupid hammocks. They were suddenly having a bday party so a fuck ton of kids were on it so it was taking forever to get down because I didn't want to flip again

A girl kept fucking touching me. Like grabbing my ass and my leg, I kept telling her to stop. I finally got down and when I walked to my car fucking dogs were running at me. Which morphed into fucking zoo animals I was standing next to a lion and a tiger. Some noise went off and I stood so fucking still and they finally wandered off. Suddenly I woke up at home in bed

I woke up feeling AWFUL, almost like I was hungover and drunk/high at the same time. And it was 455 in the afternoon so I was shocked, I remember going to bed and I was panicking that the people drugged me. I looked in the mirror and my teeth were cracked and bleeding, the blood vessels in my eyes were broken, I was so scared I ran to my mom crying and she was like wtf, I showed her my teeth and she looked confused so I touched one and realized they were fine and I finally woke up.

Im sweating. Im scared. Im sad."
Ketamine and BPD questions,1,mfil8k,1,"Hi, I usually lurk around here time to time when scrolling through reddit but wanted to get some input on my upcoming treatment.

My psychiatrist and I came to the conclusion that ketamine might be the best treatment option since all prior medicine plans fell through, and with my history of experimenting with psycadelics of various forms and degrees with good and bad experiences that it would be worth a shot.

Like I stated previously, I've dabbled with various forms of psycadelics. The most extreme in which was dmt which to my knowledge and understanding I went through an acute form of 'ego death' which helped me move past a suicidal ideology I had. Without getting to in depth about said event, I've experienced my fair share of experiences with said things, but there's always a slight anxiety of going into said mind state. I've heard here and there of various experiences with said treatment, and was curious if anyone has any information on how it went for them and what to expect from it.

What I know so far is I'll be administered 6 doses across 2 weeks to begin with therapy sessions intertwined with each appointment, then set on a more loose schedule depending on the effects. I am curious on how that compares to others, and what it was like for you going into it, during and what your results are and maybe even how far along some of you are with it.

Any information is welcome, and I'm very grateful for any help provided. I wish you all the best with your struggles and always remember to keep getting back up because. Thanks!"

Is there ever a way off the rollercoaster?,4,mfhxvx,1,"I know it's terrible, but I also don't know how to not be on a constant rollercoaster ride. After years of failed relationships and broken hearts and more reckless adventure than I can even remember (partially due to trauma memory gaps) I'm really at the end of what feels like a very long train. Maybe its the front. Who knows. I don't even know if I want off the ride? Or if I could? I feel as tho all I have left is abunch of sad stories that people who don't live like this enjoy and the sad loneliness of never having felt at home in any of it. What is look at as a reckless abandonment for freedom and life has actually been a desperate attempt at finding a home, within myself and on this planet. Or maybe everyone sees me as I am and I'm the only one thats missing the point. Who can say, but I know that I'm fucking tired. Abandon them all and no one can abandon you, abandon yourself and find that there's nothing to hold and that's just terrible.

discussion time... how aware are you that people live just fine lives and do not have severe mental illness?,36,mfhhzg,10,"im going to ask my psychiatrist about this when i go back next week. 


this sort of dawned on me the other day... there must be a lot of people that live their daily lives without constant struggle.


...right?


the world couldnt function if everyone else was like me. all i have known for my entire adult life is constant struggle, distress, not being able to take care of myself, not being able to hold down a job. ive seen my coworkers go about their lives, been working those jobs for 10 years. i can hardly keep a single aspect of my life together for *2 weeks*...


do people really live without constant mental pain? i cant imagine how that feels. i cant imagine holding it together. it feels like a stupid question. it feels stupid to ask; do people really just wake up, go to work, so some hobbies/chores, go to bed, and not feel reality falling apart???? it seems like yeah, obviously. but i just cant imagine it. 


i know if you also have BPD you might not be able to answer this question. and i know everyone will experience some degree of depression/anxiety in their life, but it doesnt completely consume who they are. i would like to discuss these things."

She’s super independent. She’s been seeing him 2 or 3 times a week. We live together and I know I can’t demand all of her time but we were just watching a show together. We watch the new episode every week. No cheating and watching it by ourselves first. Well she left in the middle to go to his place. So now I’m sitting in my living room alone feeling abandoned. I feel like I’m being left behind. Like I’m losing my best friend. She’s the only long term non family relationship that I’ve had that’s lasted. I know I’m being irrational but I’m spiraling and I have no one to talk to."
Going from kinda liking the way I look to absolutely despising everything about me in a very short time. Anyone Else?,28,mfh33d,9,"I kinda have this extreme instability of my self image. It literally effects the way I see myself on pictures and in the mirror and it's pretty scary. Sometimes I take pictures and I'm like ""oh yes that's really good"". then my self image falls apart because my negative emotions take over and I end up really fucking hating the pictures of me that I used to love. I sometimes even end up deleting photos that are old...I really regret doing that from time to time.

What's more scary is: the more I look at myself when my self esteem is low and my self image is very negative, the angrier I get and that makes it worse. To the point where I literally cut myself to punish myself for having such a disgusting body.

I have scars on my chest that had to get stitches. I cut my chest because I hated that my heart was beating inside of it, keeping my gross body alive..  
Every time I feel pretty or whatever I end up thinking, that it might just be an illusion or something.  
Every time I do something wrong or I feel bad or fucked up or whatever I cannot stand my reflection in the mirror. I even ended up smashing one.  


Has anyone had similar experiences? :("
What do you do when you start splitting on your SO?,8,mfh0ye,0,"I caught myself splitting today and was proud of myself for being able to identify what was going on. DBT says when anger isn’t justified to gently avoid and/or be a little nice. I ignored a couple of my partner’s texts and then told them that I needed some time to myself to work through some thoughts. My partner knows that I have BPD and is very understanding about my periodic need for seemingly unprompted timeouts.

I spent a few hours talking to one of my parents, grocery shopping and taking/editing pictures for my side hustle (pet photography). I felt better after a while and eventually okay enough to talk to them and see how their day was.

Even though I was diagnosed 5 years ago, I feel like today might be the first time I’ve ever fully realized what a splitting episode is. It isn’t permanent. I still love my partner. I hated them for a brief period of time. And then it was over and I was back to loving them again."
I wish I could just stop feeling,4,mfgmoo,2,"I’m never going to be capable of loving someone in a normal way or the way that they deserve so I’m just going to keep hurting people. And honestly, I don’t like how having a FP makes me feel most of the time but I literally can’t control it. Maybe I should just move to the woods and never make contact with another human again. My current FP doesn’t realize how terrible a person I am (or that he’s my FP for that matter) and it’s only a matter of time before I scare him off. I honestly would rather have no emotions at all than this constant rollercoaster."
Is anybody else genuinely friendless and alone?,26,mfg9oa,4,"I don't mean, like, occasionally self-isolating or ""only"" having one close friend or a boyfriend, but being straight up friendless against your will.

For over 8 years, I've been really alone (a lot of it has been down to shitty circumstances like homeschooling during high school, taking gap years, transferring to a new university during COVID, etc) and struggled A LOT with having any social life whatsoever. This has prevented me from having a lot of basic life experiences any other 23 year old I know has had, and I haven't had any friends I've actually felt close to and trusted in adulthood whatsoever.

The worst part is that I literally don't even know why I lost most of my veryyyy few remaining friends over the past few months too? (Not a friend group--separate people) No arguments, no weird moments, nothing. Some of them suddenly started making up random excuses for months on end, or we'll even agree to a vague plan during a certain timeframe (ie: over the weekend) and have normal text conversations until I ask ""So which day works better for you if you're still down?"" and they ghost me. I haven't even been in our city much until now since I spent the previous two quarters on campus (these people were ones I keep in touch with, although we don't text nonstop daily or anything), yet they COMPLETELY changed their attitudes towards me. They make up excuses to not invite me to things and lead normal social lives outside of this, so it's not like they're self-isolating. Similarly, every guy I like just uses me for sex before getting bored and suggesting being ""friends,"" aka never seeing me again and also progressively ghosting me.

My mental health has gone downhill because I relied a lot on just being AROUND people at school and work to try to cope with not having friends. I've relapsed into a severe ED, my self harm has progressed and gotten more frequent, and I fear that I'm going to have an actual psychotic break and not be able to get through spring because I have such bad BPD episodes (no, not around others) that I can't even recognize myself anymore.

I'm the only person I know in this situation so idk, any kind words or similar experiences are welcome. Feel free to vent :'')"
"How Do You Define the Concept of ""Processing your Emotions?"" (Question and Venting)",2,mfg6w3,0,"I'm so sorry for my super long post. I didn't mean for it to be anywhere near this long!

Basically have been so messed up mentally and I've been in therapy steadily for about ten years now. (I'm 31) Also, I have tried DBT Therapy (I had to quit because they didn't accept insurance and they were EXPENSIVE! I loved that therapist though; I wish he had been a regular psychologist) I have tried outpatient treatment at a hospital, I have done soooo many things.

I have also tried lots of different medications, I've had to suffer from heavy withdraws from some of those, and I'm actually having a vagus nerve stimulator implanted in my body in a few days! I had to do A LOT of screening, tests, background, etc and I have tried and been unsuccessful in at least 4 different types of therapy, so I was a candidate. (It's part of a study where the product has already been approved by the FDA several years ago & it's from Germany where they have great healthcare. The study is to convince insurance companies in the US to pay for it, if that makes sense)

I feel so alone. I've had a lot of deaths in the family recently and my cat that I have had since I was sixteen recently passed too. That was the worst. She was my best friend and mini me. When I would have panic attacks, she would climb on my back and lay there steadily until I calmed down) I could go on and on, but my cat Eleanor was everything to me.  I've never been more isolated (COVID or not) I'm starting to see myself age for the first time from the stress and the mental agony. (I have always looked incredibly young for my age, I've been asked by doctors even when I was 28, if I was ""still a minor."") 

I'm becoming less prone to any kind of human touch whatsoever. It scares me. I live with my mom and I feel so guilty that she has to deal with me and that I'm not someone she can be proud of career or accomplishment wise. At the same time, she is also mentally ill from my biofather's extreme abuse and between that and my BPD (and my resentment that she didn't get me out of that abusive home) makes us fight constantly. We used to be so close in my 20's, but I honestly can't stand her now, but I still feel bad & guilty because she doesn't have to let me and my sick dog (that she also helps pay for) in her house. I feel so hollow, yet I have the world on my shoulders at the same time. I was always okay being alone, but now that I'm 31 (and I don't tell anyone I know this) I fear that due to my nature & my age, I'll never get to do normal things like get married and have a family. I NEVER did normal growing up.

I even looked into EMDR therapy (and I still haven't ruled that out) but people say how it helps you process your trauma. what does that even mean??? I don't know what that means, so how do I know if I'm doing it properly, or even at all? I've tried EVERYTHING any therapist has recommended, spent more than I can afford, try/tried yoga and meditation techniques.  I am VERY open about what I experienced as child/teen (severe abuse) I have an excellent long term memory and I can easily talk about or deconstruct events, former or current emotions, etc. But I hear also that ""medicine and xyz can help BPD symptoms, but you have to learn how to process your trauma in order to heal."" But again, what does that entail?"
Ideation into intent,2,mfg3fh,1,"I feel like everyone in my life would be better off without me. I hurt everyone. My words are venom. 

This is the first time I’ve actively thought about jumping in front of a train... always told myself “at least it’s never jump infront of a  train bad”. 

Guess not."
JUST GET OVER IT,1,mfg2qv,5,This statement is such a huge trigger for me. I love my boyfriend very much and I want a future with him but his inability to show compassion when I try and open up to him is truly getting old. I don’t know how to make him understand that I don’t want to be this way. Any pointers?
None of my normal grounding methods are working,4,mff6ov,2,"I’ve been in a constant dissociative spell for around 24 hours and I don’t really know what to do. I’ve tried all of my normal grounding methods- meditation, sticking my face in ice water, smelling strong smells, working out, holding ice cubes- but absolutely nothing is working. I’m basically begging for any kind of advice or potential grounding techniques because I’m in a state of panic currently. Thank you all <3"
Tw Sewerslide,0,mff4bk,8,"Ive been actively suicidal for 3 days straight now, if im awake im in pain and shaking, crying and hoping for death but I promised my dog I wouldn't leave her. Any reccomendations or coping skills are much appreciated I feel like im in a 1v1 combat session with myself and I just want the other player to win already."
“Overreacting” at Work,1,mfezn2,4,"This has been really hard for me. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD since I was 19, so it’s been close to a decade now that I’ve been dealing with this. I feel like I’ve made so much progress with myself—healthier coping mechanisms, firmer boundaries with relationships, committing to therapy and meds.

But there are other times when I feel like I’ve gone nowhere. I feel like I’m still that lost teenager with no idea why I’m doing any of this. It’s been popping up a lot at work lately, and it just discourages me so much that I can’t seem to be like everyone else.

My coworkers say that I overreact, that I play the victim, that I twist words to exaggerate what people have said. After being reported for getting too upset, my boss asked me why I take things so personally. I try not to, but I don’t know if it’s possible for me. I’ve done so much work, and still I’m struggling to be able to function in my workplace.

They ask me why I get so upset, and I fall back on depression and anxiety. Then others say that they deal with the same thing, but I don’t want to tell them about my borderline. I still feel so much shame about the diagnosis.

Has anybody else dealt with this or have any advice for me? I’d appreciate anything"
How you doing?,9,mfewvh,5,"Hello everyone, I feel quite down today but don’t feel like want to talk about it. And feels like need a bit of distraction.

So instead, I would love to know how you doing today? :) What’s going on this weekend? Do you discover anything interesting? :))"
Setting boundaries with mother?,11,mfeu5h,4,"Hey everyone. I'm finding it extremely hard to articulate boundaries to my mother despite explaining them to her for years. Unfortunately, this sometimes causes me to react with significant anger when she violates my boundaries. She behaves in a way which negates my personal space, privacy, emotions, and achievements. (giving away my things while I'm out of the house, minimizing my concerns, lying about things I've never agreed to/ said to third parties, saying things like ""I made you, you'd be nothing without me"" etc.) Currently, I am not in a position to move out. I constantly feel unheard, pressured and disrespected. Is there a way in which I can approach her differently about this?"
DAE wish they had something physically wrong with them instead.,46,mfetlc,10,"I was called back to work...but quickly burned out and had to go on medical leave. Afraid of losing my job, I went back way too early. The day I was supposed to go back...I had a nasty panic attack and realized that I couldn't go back.

I'm in the process of trying to find a psychiatrist who can treat me for these issues I have before I end up either involuntarily committed or dead. You'd think me being furloughed for close to a year would allow me to work on my mental health but it didn't.

Now my other coworkers (who got let go during the cutbacks) are posting about coming back and I'm feeling like shit. Why couldn't I stay strong long enough for these people to come back and take the load off?

I feel like a burden and that everyone else at work is only polite on the outside. Inside, I feel like they hate me because I'm too lazy to keep up. But I know the stigma around mental illnesses, especially BPD.

When I complained to my FP that I wished I had cancer, a limp or heart problems instead, at least people see those things and are understanding...he got mad. He survived cancer himself and both of his parents are battling cancers themselves. He told me that I should never wish for something like that.

And I see his point; being sick is not something anyone actively wants, especially with an illness that can be terminal.

But people can't see you fighting demons when the demons are in your head. They can't see you getting tired and inwardly screaming for help when you're able to walk and talk just like everyone else. They don't see you looking at the pills, the homemade noose, the knife, the gun or the long drop you're standing in front of and praying someone will find you before the pain takes over.

All they see is a person who has all the physical abilities to function but seemingly chooses to not get up.

I wish I didn't feel so alone."
i can't tell the difference between love and obsession,39,mfesnw,9,"I don't think i've ever felt true love before, all my relationships were unstable and hurt me a lot, but lately i've been talking to a girl and now im attached to her. I can't tell if what i feel for her it's love or obsession, i feel so happy and free when she's around, seems like i found the love of my life, but when she's busy or is rude to me i can feel my world collapse. All that love and hapiness that i felt before turn into rage, i say to myself that i don't wanna see her ever again, that i hate her so much and stuff like that. Do i really love her or do i just need someone to gimme support and approval?

(also im not a native english speaker so im sorry for my poor grammar)"
I've made mistakes in my past I can't get past.,7,mfelzl,3,"Because I went undiagnosed with BPD for so long, I made mistakes in my teen years and twenties, like hanging out with unstable, toxic people, who ended up making my life hell in my adult life. Even though I've cut these peoole out of my life long ago, the memories and traumas of the past still haunt me to this day. I have a single friend (who is more like my care taker at this point), a great psychotherapist, but no family or anyone else to confide in or hang out with. I have developed this agoraphobia recently and I get panicked at the thought of leaving the house by myself. Additionally, when I actually do leave the house, I can only be out for short periods before a panic or anxiety starts to rise in my chest, like everyone is staring at me or judging me. Ive tried seeking friends online, but its not the same. What should I do?"
I absorb other peoples emotions and let it affect me,18,mfef33,8,"Hi guys. I’ve already posted so much on here but everyone is so nice. Anyway, tonight my boyfriend is angry and stressed because he did some paperwork wrong which has resulted in him not getting into uni. I’ve now done that thing where I take on his emotion and internalise it myself, meaning I’m now feeling angry and stressed and finding it hard to regulate my emotions. I also feel annoyed at him for not sorting this, even if that is unjust, I just wish he would be more independent with this stuff. Because I practically raised myself, I’m very independent (the raising myself thing also caused my BPD but that’s another story) and my boyfriend just isn’t, and because I love to give to people I care about and am eager to please, I do a lot of stuff for him. This time I didn’t and now he’s having a meltdown. I guess I’m just venting cos I’m stressed, but if anyone else ever gets this too it would be nice to know you relate."
How to get rid of impulsivity?,2,mfeccn,0,"I just lost my job recently so I'm super scared and anxious. A full meltdown is gradually getting closer.

I've never been super impulsive before but now I absolutely can't sleep and keep shopping online. Money is already tight but all of a sudden I have a drive to buy buy buy. Even around my house I'm rearranging things, making and completing projects, staying up late into early morning of the next day. Then hours later I feel extremely depressed and want to hurl myself out my window and bleed to death.

Lately these are my days: staying up shopping - reinventing my house - crash and sleep - wake up late - try not to kill myself - and the cycle continues every day.

How do I stop these impulsive high and depressive lows? Are there any DBT skills to focus on to skip impulsivity and insomniac nights? Please help, I've lost myself again :("
Sad Realization,9,mfec6u,3,"I have realized that I will probably be my own fate. I struggle with suicidal ideation, and often at the slightest issue or uncomfortable feeling my mind wanders to the thought of suicide. I have made about 3 attempts total that landed me in the hospital, and other close calls. Just last week I was ready to kill myself, I had it all planned out and i managed to snap out of it when I couldn’t breathe, but still.

When I calm down I don’t want to die, I want to be here, but when I get upset it feels like suicide is the only option. If it weren’t for my mom hiding my meds I might not even be here, even if I don’t really want to die. It’s just in those moments I don’t know what will make it all go away and everything feels just utterly unbearable. I always come down and the emotions pass but my brain doesn’t realize or understand that it will pass. It makes me wonder if there will come a day where I get the impulsive urge to end my life and it will end up being the death of me, even if I really didn’t want to die. 

I fear one day I won’t be able to stop myself or I’ll get into an emotional frenzy where all rational thinking goes out the window, I had a very close call last May where that almost happened. It feels like my fate is to end up killing myself the question just becomes... when?

Idk if this makes any sense or if anyone else can relate, I know I can’t be alone because this is such a huge part of BPD but still."
I Don't Feel Good Enough Because of What My S/O Did In Bed Please Help Me Cope I Have No Self Worth Right Now,39,mfe7sk,15,"They asked first, but they watched porn-like content while we were sleeping together. I mean, literally at the exact same time. I said yes because I was shocked they would ask to do that when I was right there, giving them what I thought I wanted. When I felt them get more and more into what was on the screen I couldn't stop but going into a fit of both sadness and rage. I wasn't good enough for them, why am I not good enough for them? I know it's normal for people to watch content during sex to get off, but I can't stop myself from crying and cutting because I couldn't do enough. I sadly use sex as a way of having self-worth, and my sex wasn't good enough so I'm not good enough. It's been over a week, I still can't stop crying over this.

I tried bringing it up to them and they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. I got so upset I just dropped it. It's been a week now, I can't bring myself to talk to them about it because they probably think I'm pathetic. I am pathetic."
Got a text from someone telling me that after I told them I had BPD and it’s hard for me to trust people that they looked it up and that’s when the “dots connected.” :/,7,mfe03p,4,"He was someone that I was interested in and I thought the feeling was mutual until he told me he still had feelings for his ex and I asked him if I was just a fuck toy until he found someone better and he said “not necessarily” which to me felt like “maybe/probably” which to me felt like “yes.” 
So I got inebriated and kind of unleashed. Said some horrible things that I deeply regret because I’m pathetic and can’t handle being rejected. 
I kept asking him to just block me. I was trying to hurt his feelings. I was trying to push him away but he just kept reassuring me which made me feel worse. I said, why won’t you block me? And he just said cause I only block bad people and you’re a good person. What about me makes him think I’m a good person. I deliberately tried to hurt his feelings because I felt bad for myself. 
When he made the comment about how it made sense that I had BPD I told him, if there’s anything you take from your experience with me it’s to please not make any generalizations about people with BPD. I told him I’m a person, not my disorder and it’s gross for him to make an assumption about everyone with BPD based on one experience. That it’s becoming much more relevant in the mental health community, and someone he knows and loves probably has it, and are scared to talk about it because of being stigmatized like that. 
I said most of us are brilliant, charismatic, beautiful, outgoing thinkers n we don’t want pity, we just want to be understood. 
I’m sick of telling people I struggle with this disorder just to either be treated like the “life of the party” or a charity case. 
I’m sorry this post was all over the place I just needed to fucking vent. Thanks 4 ur time"
"CPTSD vs BPD, stigma discussion, deconstructing internalized ableism",0,mfdy8c,3,"I had a wondering and thought people in this group would be most equipped to share their experiences?

Especially anyone who was misdiagnosed at first, or has a comorbidity of both

I have CPTSD and I’ve noticed that I have a lot in common with people with BPD? In experiences, symptoms, treatment, et cetera. I tried doing some research to understand better and from what I can tell the main difference is that those with BPD don’t have a static sense of identity? but I don’t know how much I research is truth and how much is stigma."
I saw a post that was deleted earlier about someone being offended that bpd is in the same personality cluster as aspd/npd,198,mfdsfq,84,"Cluster B is grouped together as the “dramatic/erratic/impulsive” personalities that’s all there is to it. 

The second thing that upset me was that just like none of us chose to have bpd, no one chooses to have npd/aspd. No one wants to live a life that is so different from the ‘normal human experience’ I believe that regardless of the defensiveness that can sometimes make us/me think otherwise. 

And i understand to an extent where they were coming from, in that people with aspd have a higher likelihood of causing harm due to impaired empathy but like we also unintentionally (for the most part i assume) cause harm just being who we are too. And i think that just because none of us chose to be this way, doesn’t make any of us less responsible for trying to manage/treat the parts of us that make life difficult on us/others. I didn’t appreciate the shaming because it triggered the shame i felt when i got my bpd diagnosis tbh, but I understand it probably came from a bad experience with someone who has aspd. 

There is no point to this I’ve just been thinking about it since i saw that post, but i wish successful treatment for all of us and an improved quality of life for us and our loved ones.

Edit: grammar"
"DAE love the chase of a new relationship, then suddenly lose feelings for them when a relationship becomes plausible?",123,mfdfs4,21,"I feel like I enjoy the chase a lot.. I get giddy and excitable and so overwhelmed with attraction and affection when I first start talking to someone. 
Then, as soon as we take steps to actually go on a date or something, I suddenly rethink everything and no longer want to be with/around that person. 
And after that, it's like a 50/50 chance whether or not I'll wake up one day completely obsessed with them, or completely regretting liking them. 

On a side note, does anyone only really feel attraction towards others who show interest in you? Like, I can't really develop feelings for a person until after they start showing interest in me. It feels incredibly toxic, and I do feel genuine affection towards them, but it's like the reason is that I'm only really interested in their attention."
I blocked my fp,2,mfczr8,1,"I fell in love with this girl last year, and we dated for a little bit. Everything was perfect, but we went from that to the relationship being unsustainable as quickly as we fell in love.

Although I knew (know) we weren’t good for each other, I still clung to her because it was the first time anyone ever seemed to actually like me. The breakup made me lose my shit, I was self harming constantly and even tried to commit suicide twice.

Little less than a month ago, she reached out. She love bombed the shit out of me, and then she grew distant. I couldn’t send her one song about love without her freaking out, even though that first night she had sent me Pink In The Night by Mitski... which is a lot more intense than the stuff I sent her. She disappears for days at a time and once blamed my relationship with alcohol for her to have ghosted me for a week.

She’s not open to communication whatsoever. I can’t tell her that she’s hurting me and to please stop because she will turn my feelings against me and discredit them.

Anyways, I just blocked her. I’m scared because I feel like I will be alone forever, but I’m in dbt and, when my therapist and I were establishing my life goals, I realized that I don’t see myself being married in the future. I want my future to be simple, to live in a big house with a yard and a variety of animals and to just be alone and content. I want to be comfortable being by myself.

Sorry if this didn’t make any sense, I took my sleeping pill early today"
Original Trauma,3,mfcs23,2,"Until I was a late teen I had this sense that something traumatic had happened to me. It was the only thing that made sense to explain my anger, my fear of abandonment, and so on and so forth.

One day my suspicions were confirmed when I took a sneak peek in the diaries my father kept from the time that my mother left him to a few months after their divorce was decreed. I got to one evening's entry and before me were the opening details of one of their post-separation fights. I knew this fight. My father's words matched my memories of this night, before and after the event which was to change my life like no other could. That event was my mother's attempt to murder me with a pair of scissors.

After discovering this horror, I dissociated for about an hour and then, for decades, pretended, hoped, and pleaded with myself that my mother must have been really messed up with drugs and that was the reason for the attack. Although another decade and a half would pass before I got my BPD diagnosis, I knew this event was responsible for all those BPD symptoms I had been experiencing. Undoubtedly, I have some degree of untreated PTSD, too.

About a year ago, my father, from his death bed gave me the whole story. I requested this. My mother had previously stated to him that I was no longer what she wanted as a child, and that she was going to do something about that. That night, she hurled a rock or brick through a patio door to gain access to our townhouse, and she burned my father's arm with a cigarette to get him to release me. The scar he had on his arm was significant, so I believe him when he said he tried his best to hold onto me as best he could, but the pain was too much. She got ahold of me and held me hostage for around an hour while local police negotiated with her. She made a motion to stab me in the neck, but one of the officers leapt at her (and me) and rolled her off my, saving my life. Despite this, she wasn't charged -- it was 1971 and attitudes may have been different (I'm not sure).

To this day, the memory of being taken hostage and my mother attempting to murder me are well surpressed, though I have vivid memories of that night before and after the attack. I even remember sitting in a police car, chatting with the dispatcher as the officer worked the radio for me.

I think the memory supression is a good thing. And I hate my mother."
Studying.,3,mfcpgm,3,"I got this really important exam in not less than a month, and if small stuff already get me too anxious, this one feels like my life will end. I decided to vent here, in hope of support, maybe, after a really bad anxiety attack. 

Studying with BPD is hell, and it's not even an excuse to perform less, because the system will not give you credits for all those depressif episodes when you couldn't even find purpose to waking up, or the mania one where you couldn't calm your ass, searching for other more interesting ideas and discovering new hobbies you never knew had. 

And no, I can't just brush it off and think about all the other solutions that I have if I ever don't pass, I feel like I will fail my life if I don't get a score that will get me to a good university. (for french people, if you're here, you might know les classes préparatoires mp, that's what I'm talking about).

so if someone got any advice for a poor soul just trying to live without feeling like a complete failure, they're more than welcomed to do so."

A question for you ladies,2,mfbjow,10,"Hello there. Please remove this post if this is unacceptable and guide me to the right place if possible. 
I'm writing this on behalf of my daughter who is 22. We live in the UK .

She was diagnosed with Bpd a few months ago and is currently being stabilised on medication. She has also gone through the assessments (SKID) and is on track to start dbt therapy.

My daughter doesn't use reddit and has asked me to ask you a question with regards to medication and menstrual cycles. 

She is currently on lamotrigine and it has completely stopped her menstrual cycle. Just for background information she has always had erratic cycles despite being on meds to calm them but since starting this medication (3 months)she hasn't had one at all.


Her consultant has said this is very rare and might have to consider changing her medication but my daughter is extremely hesitant to change her medication as this is the first time in years she is starting to feel abit more balanced mentally and has stated she won't cope with another medication change which I completely understand. 

Has this happened to anybody else? Any advice?"
Can someone please explain cognitive empathy to mee,2,mfb3xl,4,"Hi so I kinda get it I think but I’m not sure. Someone explained it to me as like, knowing how a persons brain is working. So you can tell when someone’s sad and you feel it too etc. And you can tell deep down how someone is treating you even if you can’t always tell if it’s paranoia or intuition at some point deep down you know it’s intuition cus you can literally feel how they’re manipulating you. And becuase of bpd you’re most likely mirroring that manipulative behaviour because of the empathy and knowing how their brain is working. 

Then one day it clicks that your behaviour was mirrored from them. 


Or something like that. I’m probably wrong. Please tell me if I am, I think the medical definition confuses me cus it sounds complicated."

How do you deal with your birthday without drug binging or self harming,8,mfae5s,3,"This is a new for me. I'm turning 27 which is a special age for me.

Which furthers adds to desire to get shitfaced and/or selfharm right now. 

I can meditate, keep myself busy, etc. I can't handle impulsivity despite experience. I've preemtively removed myself from being near substances and I'm surrounded by my parents but I hate them.

How do I teach my son self love even though I hate myself?,5,mfa3i3,4,I'll keep this one short. I have a 4 month old. I have the constant fear my personality will rub off on him.

Does anyone else get 'bored' of people easily?,6,mf9mk6,3,"I don't know why but I get 'bored' of people after a while.
It causes me to start talking to someone new, reply to them as soon as they message, get really close with them, make loads of plans with them that I intend to do but after a while I just... don't want to do them anymore? When they want to meet up I would rather just.. not. Messaging regularly/often turns to barely replying and I'd rather not talk to them at all even if I really do like them. I end up letting people down and I hate it. It's like a loop and I'm the only one to blame.

I have friends that I've had for years and I get like that sometimes with them too even though I absolutely adore them so its not that I don't like them, it just happens and I dont know why.

I was only diagnosed with bpd earlier this month so I don't really know too much about it and it would help if you guys could help me figure out what it is and share your own experiences if you get like this too ❤

Aswell as bpd I have (diagnosed) mixed anxiety and depression, I also have cfs (chronic fatigue syndrome) so I get exhausted easily and I'm not sure if its linked to that possibly?"
Hello fellow older borderliners,200,mf970p,89,"I searched the sub for “older” today and found a couple threads with people closer to my age. I felt so much less alone.  Thanks to you all older folks that posted in those threads.

I wasn’t even diagnosed until my mid 40s, so although I feel at home with the feelings people discuss, I have felt out of place reading posts here.  It’s a weird place to be, 1/2+ of the way through life yet just at the beginning of the bpd journey.  I had a pretty good life in retrospect, but I blew it up, and now I know bpd is why I did that.  Happiness-wise I’m probably about the same many days.

I’ve been attempting to rebuild a life since I blew it up half a decade ago (I haven’t known about the bpd until more recently).  It’s always 1 step forward, 2 steps back, and COVID has been like a tornado that blew me back almost to the starting line..."
"If you want to know what it’s like to have BPD, let me tell you...",486,mlfkrq,82,"EDIT: Thank you for the awards! I’m so glad me sharing my experiences and feelings resonated with so many of you. Thank you for all of the kind comments! You’re all lovely and valid❤️

This example is literally just from today and I think it sums up my experience with BPD pretty accurately. 

Today, my FP (also my S/O) went to work. He texted me after and told me he made a work friend that he found out he knew from a high school club (they competed against each other apparently). He shared this info with me to bring up one of those “small worlds” moments, but I couldn’t help but wonder if it was a girl, if they flirted with him, etc. I thought, what if he starts to like this person, thinks they’re better than me and leaves me?
I rationalized these thoughts quickly but I’m not proud that I even had them in the first place. 

Then he told me he was gonna start his drive home. Sometimes he’ll call me on his drive and tell me about his day. He didn’t today, so I asked if he wanted to, and if he didn’t feel like it, it’s okay. (I always make sure to do this, I do not want him to feel obligated to talk to me). He didn’t answer because he was DRIVING. Rationally I know that’s why. But my brain is mean, and a bad thought I had was that he was sick of me, probably saw my text before he started his drive, and ignored it because he thought I was being clingy and annoying. I thought, maybe he’s thinking about that person he knew from work and doesn’t want to talk to me and ruin it. He clearly hates me because he didn’t respond.

I RATIONALLY know none of this is true, but the thing with BPD is, you can objectively know one thing, but feel the emotions of another, and not be able to stop it. It’s like you see yourself about to crash but there’s nothing you can really do to stop it from happening. 

Then, he gets home, sends me a snapchat of his cat, and he hasn’t responded to my text. Rationally, I know he probably walked in, saw his cat, started to pet her, and thought, oh, my girlfriend would like to see this, sent me a video, thats it. 

But my mind was convincing myself that he is ignoring me because he thinks i’m annoying and is trying to prove to me that he doesn’t care about my texts by letting me know he’s active on other social media. I figured he was afraid to say no to calling me on his drive because he knows i’m sensitive and I’ll be very sad if he rejected me in any way, so he doesn’t want to deal with me being emotional and burdening him. I started to feel like a massive nuisance. So I texted him and told him he can say no to me when I ask to call if he wants to. 

Poor guy just calmly explained to me that he didn’t see my texts because he was driving, then came home, saw the cat, pet her. It was that simple. It was that simple for him, and for me I went on a whirlwind of intense emotions where I thought he hated me, was going to leave me for somebody else, that he was purposely ignoring me, that I was an emotional burden and he’d be better off without me. 

And it’s only noon. lol"
Work,190,mlaj0e,37,"Anyone else have a difficult time when it comes to work? No matter what the actual job is you just feel that you're a waste of space there, that you don't perform as well as others. Just constantly putting yourself down and feeling super anxious to the point that you're almost sick before work. I never had a problem with holding a job. But I'm so sick and tired of dreading my job despite what it is. And this anxiety is starting to catch up to me. Thanks for letting me vent and if you have any advice It would be much appreciated. Stay safe guys."
Does anyone else wonder why their SO is still with them?,11,mloy52,5,"My BPD has been flaring for about a month, and I truly don't understand how my husband could still love me/hasn't left me. I'm not mean to him at all, but I need constant reassurance, and we always are talking about our relationship and my goddamn stupid ~fEeLinGS~. It must be so tiring for my husband and get so old, but he just keeps telling me all day every day that he loves me. I don't understand it, but I am so thankful.

I'll be so happy when I can pull myself out of this spell. It seems to happen spontaneously and resolve in much the same way, so I'm trying to ride it out as best I can. I don't have access to DBT because all the therapists are too expensive. I see one at Catholic Charities who isn't trained in DBT."
Accepted into my masters (and much more),47,mldpls,3,"Sooooo this is a huge victory for me. I struggled *so much* with my sense of self and didn’t know who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 

I graduated high school in 2013 and left my home at 17 with only a backpack filled with everything I could fit in it. I established myself 650 miles from where I grew up, with no financial help from parents. 

I tried multiple programs but could literally *never* find something that truly fed me and who would lead me to an actual job. 

My life was chaos. I was homeless for a while (I was lucky enough to stay at a friends place so I was never out on the streets), I couldn’t afford basic necessities, I couldn’t pay my rent. I did sex work for a while. I was in unhealthy relationships. 

It was hard. But I’m quite persistent. 

In 2018 I met my partner. In 2019 I landed an amazing job that totally fuelled my passion for education and gave me purpose. In 2020 we moved into a great apartment. In 2021 we got engaged and I just got into my masters. In a year we’ll be married and he’ll have graduated from an engineering program. 

I turned 25 last months and for the first time in my life I know who I am and I’m safe. 

Life just gets so much better, just keep swimming."
DAE feel massively unsupported by mental health services,12,mln4et,2,"People in BPD are way more likely to attempt suicide, and way more likely to suceed, yet taken far less seriously than other mental health disorders because our ideation is more frequent and impulsive. And honestly I'm sick of it. 

I get it, attempts to hurt myself are a regular thing for me, feeling suicidal is a regular thing for me. But especially when it goes up in intensity I feel there is 0 support. I've flat out told services what I plan to do, with no prevention or intervention before I do it. I've been given mental health numbers more than I can count, been given the speech, been told ""we understand you're asking for help"" on my attempts, to the point where they don't even bother sectioning me or taking me to hospital any more they just tell emergency services to leave me at home. 

I feel let down, I feel I'm left alone to struggle. I'm tired of being asked what I want them to do to help, and then being told they can't do that because we must think longer term. It only takes one attempt for me to succeed in seriously hurting myself. In the moments I really need help, and don't get it, it makes me want to hurt myself out of pure spite to these services. 

Just today I was told that because I dont wake up early enough, I am not engaging and will be discharged if I don't fix my sleep. Despite attending 12 weeks of therapy and not missing one session, despite not missing one appointment with my care navigator, despite calling all of the helplines they give me before I take action, I'm not engaging. To them, non engagement must be the only reason I am not feeling better.

I'm sorry I'm just so sick of it honestly. I just want help and I want to stop being given the same bullshit when it comes to me being in a desperate situation."
Poor ability to recall memories after arguments?,28,mlgp97,8,"Whenever my boyfriend and I have an argument, I find that over the course of the few hours we fight, I begin to forget the beginning of the argument. The next day, it's like it never happened. Does this happen to anyone else?

For me, I know that it hurts him that I can't remember. One thing I do remember is that every time, he specifically says ""and the worst part is that you won't remember any of this tomorrow."" I don't consciously choose to forget! My brain just doesn't let me for whatever reason. Maybe I dissociate without realizing it, I don't know. I also have a hard time recalling memories from my childhood so maybe it's related? Anyone else also have problems with memories from their childhood???"
I’m so sick of reading stigmatising things about BPD!!,11,mlm8fy,5,"I literally hate some of the things I read about BPD. I was looking for articles/info online to give my friends about BPD so they know how it affects me and my relationships and so many of them say things that I just don’t feel is correct. For example describing relationships with us as “tumultuous” and “emotionally draining”. I mean I realise that difficulty in relationships is such a huge part of BPD, but so many of us work so, so hard to be the best people we can, and we also have even more love and empathy to give than other people! I just feel like it’s so unfair that it’s so easy to access articles online that say things like “manipulative” and “destructive” when most of us are just doing our best to navigate normal life with these intense emotions and feelings about people. Yes, BPD can be awful and cause us to act in ways we aren’t proud of, but we do our best to not let it control us and we have so much love to give. 

TL;DR- I’m a fucking good person and a great friend and I’m sick of reading about how difficult it is to know us."
Does anyone else not understand themselves ? One minute I’m head over heels for someone the next I’m repulsed :/,7,mlo89u,4,"I don’t know how to even explain this because I’m such a confusing person. If I confuse myself, how can I expect anyone else to understand me? I can’t believe I even act like this and I genuinely can’t help it. 

I’ll really like someone be all over them etc and vice versa then the next Im like ‘omg what in the hell, I defo don’t like you etc’ it’s like a cycle. I’m like this with family too... mind F*CK I tell you.  I don’t even think I’m capable of love because everytime it’s like ‘NEXT’.... sigh"
Ex asking to hookup update!!,11,mllnhw,4,"Guess what! 

Ex messaged me again asking to hookup after I ignored him the first time. Instead of ignoring him again I decided to give a mature (I think) message. 

“You used, manipulated, and lied to me. I spent so long healing and finally have moved on from you and you need to do the same thing, clearly sexually. You have no idea how badly you hurt me Jozef. Your actions traumatized me. 

You need to reevaluate yourself if you think this is okay to do. Frankly it’s disrespectful thinking I’m a disposable sex object here at your beck and call.”

“You waited three months to ask to hookup” 

Did I do okay? 

And I know for a fact that he read that shit because as I went to paste it and once again he said “never mind” after asking. Not even a minute later did I send my message. That’s how I know there is no way he didn’t see it. It shut him up and I don’t think he’ll ever message me again. 

For three months he has thought about me solely sexually, enough for him to ask twice. And I know he’s been pleasuring himself to the thought of me. The sad thing is that he probably didn’t delete my nudes when I asked. Makes me sick."
Dissociating during intimacy/sex?,9,mlmrgq,11,"The funny thing is I'm hypersexual. I frequently think about sex, just to not be fully present when it's actually happening. Every time things start heading there, or even when it becomes a possibility, my mind goes away and I shut down—even if I’m the one who initiated it. Thankfully this has never affected my performance though, because hey... my BPD brain needs that validation, right? LMAO.

I don't have any recollection of being sexually abused or assaulted, so... I seriously don't know what may be causing this, to be honest."
DAE find they can't explain themselves and their emotions to people?,30,mlcfzt,10,"It always seems like I can't explain myself, what I deal with and so on to many people. It's something that is consistent, and makes it hard to keep on going and explaining it to people. I just want to explain it so people understand more.

There's things like when you attempt to talk about what you go through and what not where it then gets lessened by the other person whether intentionally or not. Their responses like ""oh we all like that *sometimes*"", (I had another example on my mind but forgot), or they talk about how they are and what it's like in attempt to relate only for me to be sat there thinking ""you really don't understand what I said, or I explained it super poorly."" In the moment it can feel really invalidating, but as I have heard said before, people can only relate with their own experiences. 

When it comes to other people like on here or someone I know locally who has BPD, usually the blanks in explaination can be filled in and understood because well.. you are both dealing with the same beast. If that makes sense.

I just want people to understand, and to support me. Know that I spend almost all my time absorbed in something like a game or something else so that I don't think about things. Maybe, it would be nice if more people knew the chaos I was dealing with internally instead of just assuming.

Anyways, sorry for the long post. I just kind of want to know what others may experience on this. I love you all and I know there are some people here I have communicated with who have been wonderful."
DAE take FOREVER to get over an ex?,4,mlqhbe,3,"Bit of a rant here

Let me start out by saying I'm NOT like this with every guy. This in regards to someone you have an emotional attachment to and feel an attachment hunger for.

Its coming up on a year since my ex broke up with me. He's a PA. He went through my since deleted account after i specifically told him I wasn't comfortable with him looking at all of it. Its my fault for thinking I could trust him in the first place. We had sex and while I was asleep he went through my account. Reading things in regards to BPD I don't even remember writing. 

I had deleted the account after the initial encounter, my reason being if i was so concerned about him finding it I shouldn't have it. Unaware he'd already gone through it.

I've been in non consensual sexual situations. Ive had people I trusted betray me. I've been violated in many ways. This was something I've never experinced before. On a psychological, interpersonal, intellectual...and Idk what all other levels.

I'm so truamatized. Yet part of me still feels desperate for his attention. I wanted a different ending to the story, any ending where I'm not left feeling unwanted and abandoned.

Even worse. I haven't the motivation to go out and meet new people. If anything I'm simply terrified of getting hurt again. I feel abandoned and feeling abandoned makes me feel worthless and feeling worthless makes me feel like I want to act out in self destructive ways. Everytime he ignored me it validated that sense of worthlessness.

I know he never got off his multiple dating apps and had me replaced in a matter of days. I'm still sitting here a year later broken. Trapped in a past that doesn't care about me anymore. Feeling worthless over somebody I dont even want to be with forever, but him discarding me still hurts all the same. 

I want to cry. I feel pathetic. I haven't engaged in self harm since July. Even if I were to give into that urge it wouldn't change anything. Id feel worse, he wouldn't care. I don't think it will come to that. I just hate feeling this way. 

I feel so abandoned and it makes me feel so worthless and theres nothing i can do about it in regards to him. Why does my entire self worth have to revolve around somebody I don't even really like??? Part of me just wanted him to prove me wrong and be nice like he was in the very beginning but that never happened.

Thanks to anyone still reading. I think I just want to feel seen and heard instead of holding all of this in like I have been."

DAE get upset remembering honeymoon phases of relationships?,18,mlewa8,8,"I started thinking about how my FP (also my significant other) used to call me almost every day and invite me over most nights. He would make an effort to cuddle with me frequently and he would video chat with me if we weren't able to see each other for a few days. He seemed generally happy and we had sex frequently.

It's been almost 3 years now and he keeps about half his clothes at my place, has a key, and keeps all his toiletries there so he basically lives with me part time, almost full time. He doesn't call me anymore, I always call him. He doesn't video chat me if we're apart for a few days. He basically puts in effort to give me attention every once in awhile, but it's not consistent like it used to be and our sex life has dwindled to almost nothing.

I understand that logically, people get comfortable together and stop putting in as much effort as they had to in the beginning of their relationships (whether it be friendships or romantic). I was mildly annoyed about our dwindling sex life, but I understand that fades naturally as well, even if I wish it didn't. I started reminiscing this morning about how things used to be and it sent me into a total panic.

She pays the bills. Every two weeks I get a $100 for food (includes my cat). The rest of the time I don't see her or ask help with anything, and that's how it has been for three years. I know that I should be, and I *am,* very grateful that I have a roof over my head and food in the fridge.

I don’t know how to do that. I try to do what’s good for me, cut out what’s bad for me, look after myself, don’t let people mistreat me. I feel better about myself.

I talked to my mom about my loans and how I was freaking out over nothing and I guess she's right...but why don't I feel any better?

Not to mention that my FP always makes everything about himself. I thought that maybe just this once he would try to comfort me, but instead he talks about how anxious HE is. He does this whenever I'm upset. Every single time I'm upset, he gets upset, and then I have to take care of him. If I don't, things will only get worse (ie he'll have a huge panic attack or hurt himself). I'm so fucking sick of it. 

So I had a panic attack today. I walked out of the room away from him, because he always finds a way to freak out and turn my feelings against me. It's like I'm not allowed to feel fucking anything. Having panic attacks alone is terrible, and doubly so when you're afraid for someone else. 

I'm typing this as he has came back from having a cigarette and now he's on his stupid goddamn phone. I know if I call him out on it, he's going to talk about how it helps him with his anxiety and how he wants to talk to this person he ""hasn't talked to in a long time""--so that makes it okay. If I were to do that, he'd say I'm not being there for him. Fuck him.

I'm afraid for my life. I feel like I can't do this anymore. Why go to school if I'm not sure I'll even graduate? I'm racking up all this debt and for what? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, and I wish I had someone here to comfort me. I don't know what to do--ever. 

I had to get this off my chest. Thanks for making it this far. I'd appreciate whatever messages you have."

Rules Revision,29,mf3exb,22,"Hi all! We hope you are having a great weekend. The mod team decided to revise some of the rules. The rules are more or less the same as always, but we've taken the time to elaborate on them.

Please refer back to this post if you have any questions about the rules and **let us know if you have any other questions.** And if you haven't already, please check out our new sister-sub r/BPDlite!

*Note: Bold indicates a change was made. Rule 15 is new but takes pieces from other existing rules.*

1. Everyone is welcome - We welcome participation from everyone, regardless of whether or not you are diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.
2. Etiquette - **Basically, don’t be a dick! Be kind, no insults, slurs, rudeness, invalidating behavior, or otherwise mean-spirited behavior.** We have a zero tolerance policy regarding racism, sexism, homophobia or any other forms of discrimination or prejudice. **Be empathetic and kind. Do not engage in personal attacks or flame wars.**
3. **Don't troll and don't feed the trolls - Trolling will result in a permanent ban. If you come across a post which fits this description, do not engage with trolls - it's not worth it. Report it and move on.** Replies to obvious troll posts will be removed on sight.
4. **Do not use this subreddit for diagnostic/medical insight -** Do not explicitly ask if you have BPD or any other illness. Do not even *implicitly* ask if you have BPD or another illness. Do not ask if or assume that *a friend or a loved one* has BPD or another illness. **Do not offer a diagnostic opinion to anyone on this subreddit. Do not ask for advice about medication or supplements (including illicit drugs). Do not ask for advice regarding medication - only a doctor is qualified to recommend medications, make suggestions regarding dosages, discuss medication interactions, etc.** This rule extends to speculating diagnoses for celebrities and fictional characters. Breaking this rule will result in a 3 day ban.
5. Graphic content must be appropriately flaired and tagged NSFW - The following topics fall under the umbrella of ""graphic content"": substance abuse, sexual assault, suicide, self harm, abuse, and eating disorders. If your post discusses one or many of these topics, you must flair it appropriately and tag it NSFW.

This is a text-based subreddit and we wish to encourage thoughtful discussion. There is a** r/BPDlite **thread for shorter thoughts and questions.** Posts that have absolutely no content in the body are automatically removed by u/AutoModerator. **Short posts clutter up the feed, make it harder to moderate, and take attention away from longer, more detailed posts. Short posts often lack crucial details and it makes it harder for members of the community to offer support. For example, “I feel really angry, what do I do?” To be able to help you, we need more detail and context to be able to help you. We don’t know what makes you feel angry, why you feel angry right now, or how your anger manifests. The more context, the more attention your post will get. And if your post gets more attention, you’ll likely get more and better feedback/support. Longer posts help facilitate a discussion. If your submission seems like it would be better suited as a tweet or Facebook post/status update, please post it to our sister sub** r/BPDlite.
11. Do not discuss stigmatizing online content **or make posts about other BPD subreddits** \- Sometimes people post cruel and stigmatizing things about borderline personality disorder in other places like tumblr, YouTube, Quora and Reddit. **Do not discuss other BPD subreddits other than our sister subs, which are listed in the sidebar.** Please do not discuss, link to nor create submissions about this content. This is not the place to vent about it. **If you would like to discuss online stigma regarding BPD, please visit** r/BPDlite.
12. **Keep discussion about politics to a minimum - Posts containing political discourse can be removed or approved at moderator discretion on a case by case basis. Do not engage in flame wars or personal attacks. Remember, this is a subreddit to discuss BPD, not politics.**

In most cases, your post will be removed until you can provide sources for your claims.** Incorrect information about mental illness will be met with post removal and in some cases a ban. The most common examples of myths about BPD seen on this sub are as follows: FALSE: You cannot recover from BPD.  FALSE: Having a favorite person is a part of the diagnostic criteria for BPD. FALSE: Mania is a symptom of BPD. FALSE: BPD is only caused by trauma. **Discussing/recommending Jordan Peterson and Teal Swan is not allowed here.**
14. No DM requests or sharing personal information - If you are looking for someone to talk to, try: r/r4r for DM requests, r/casualconversation for chatting, r/suicidewatch for suicide counseling. Do not post your social media handles here. There is no way of verifying that you are the one posting your own social media information/personal information. Do not share phone numbers, email, or other personal information.
15. **Do not encourage/suggest/romanticize unhealthy coping mechanisms** \- Pretty self explanatory. Do not suggest others to self-harm, self-medicate, **manipulate healthcare workers**, engage in impulsive/risky behaviors, **illegal activities, infidelity,** etc **or glorifying/seeking validation for unhealthy behaviors.** We understand that many pwBPD have had positive experiences with weed and psychedelics, however, for the time being, these suggestions will not be allowed until there is more clinical evidence supporting their effectiveness for pwBPD. **Do not romanticize or glorify BPD or any mental illness.**"
"If you want to know what it’s like to have BPD, let me tell you...",484,mlfkrq,82,"EDIT: Thank you for the awards! I’m so glad me sharing my experiences and feelings resonated with so many of you. Thank you for all of the kind comments! You’re all lovely and valid❤️

This example is literally just from today and I think it sums up my experience with BPD pretty accurately. 

Today, my FP (also my S/O) went to work. He texted me after and told me he made a work friend that he found out he knew from a high school club (they competed against each other apparently). He shared this info with me to bring up one of those “small worlds” moments, but I couldn’t help but wonder if it was a girl, if they flirted with him, etc. I thought, what if he starts to like this person, thinks they’re better than me and leaves me?
I rationalized these thoughts quickly but I’m not proud that I even had them in the first place. 

Then he told me he was gonna start his drive home. Sometimes he’ll call me on his drive and tell me about his day. He didn’t today, so I asked if he wanted to, and if he didn’t feel like it, it’s okay. (I always make sure to do this, I do not want him to feel obligated to talk to me). He didn’t answer because he was DRIVING. Rationally I know that’s why. But my brain is mean, and a bad thought I had was that he was sick of me, probably saw my text before he started his drive, and ignored it because he thought I was being clingy and annoying. I thought, maybe he’s thinking about that person he knew from work and doesn’t want to talk to me and ruin it. He clearly hates me because he didn’t respond.

I RATIONALLY know none of this is true, but the thing with BPD is, you can objectively know one thing, but feel the emotions of another, and not be able to stop it. It’s like you see yourself about to crash but there’s nothing you can really do to stop it from happening. 

Then, he gets home, sends me a snapchat of his cat, and he hasn’t responded to my text. Rationally, I know he probably walked in, saw his cat, started to pet her, and thought, oh, my girlfriend would like to see this, sent me a video, thats it. 

But my mind was convincing myself that he is ignoring me because he thinks i’m annoying and is trying to prove to me that he doesn’t care about my texts by letting me know he’s active on other social media. I figured he was afraid to say no to calling me on his drive because he knows i’m sensitive and I’ll be very sad if he rejected me in any way, so he doesn’t want to deal with me being emotional and burdening him. I started to feel like a massive nuisance. So I texted him and told him he can say no to me when I ask to call if he wants to. 

Poor guy just calmly explained to me that he didn’t see my texts because he was driving, then came home, saw the cat, pet her. It was that simple. It was that simple for him, and for me I went on a whirlwind of intense emotions where I thought he hated me, was going to leave me for somebody else, that he was purposely ignoring me, that I was an emotional burden and he’d be better off without me. 

And it’s only noon. lol"
Work,189,mlaj0e,37,"Anyone else have a difficult time when it comes to work? No matter what the actual job is you just feel that you're a waste of space there, that you don't perform as well as others. Just constantly putting yourself down and feeling super anxious to the point that you're almost sick before work. I never had a problem with holding a job. But I'm so sick and tired of dreading my job despite what it is. And this anxiety is starting to catch up to me. Thanks for letting me vent and if you have any advice It would be much appreciated. Stay safe guys."
Does anyone else wonder why their SO is still with them?,10,mloy52,5,"My BPD has been flaring for about a month, and I truly don't understand how my husband could still love me/hasn't left me. I'm not mean to him at all, but I need constant reassurance, and we always are talking about our relationship and my goddamn stupid ~fEeLinGS~. It must be so tiring for my husband and get so old, but he just keeps telling me all day every day that he loves me. I don't understand it, but I am so thankful.

I'll be so happy when I can pull myself out of this spell. It seems to happen spontaneously and resolve in much the same way, so I'm trying to ride it out as best I can. I don't have access to DBT because all the therapists are too expensive. I see one at Catholic Charities who isn't trained in DBT."
Accepted into my masters (and much more),47,mldpls,3,"Sooooo this is a huge victory for me. I struggled *so much* with my sense of self and didn’t know who I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. 

I graduated high school in 2013 and left my home at 17 with only a backpack filled with everything I could fit in it. I established myself 650 miles from where I grew up, with no financial help from parents. 

I tried multiple programs but could literally *never* find something that truly fed me and who would lead me to an actual job. 

My life was chaos. I was homeless for a while (I was lucky enough to stay at a friends place so I was never out on the streets), I couldn’t afford basic necessities, I couldn’t pay my rent. I did sex work for a while. I was in unhealthy relationships. 

It was hard. But I’m quite persistent. 

In 2018 I met my partner. In 2019 I landed an amazing job that totally fuelled my passion for education and gave me purpose. In 2020 we moved into a great apartment. In 2021 we got engaged and I just got into my masters. In a year we’ll be married and he’ll have graduated from an engineering program. 

I turned 25 last months and for the first time in my life I know who I am and I’m safe. 

Life just gets so much better, just keep swimming."
DAE feel massively unsupported by mental health services,13,mln4et,2,"People in BPD are way more likely to attempt suicide, and way more likely to suceed, yet taken far less seriously than other mental health disorders because our ideation is more frequent and impulsive. And honestly I'm sick of it. 

I get it, attempts to hurt myself are a regular thing for me, feeling suicidal is a regular thing for me. But especially when it goes up in intensity I feel there is 0 support. I've flat out told services what I plan to do, with no prevention or intervention before I do it. I've been given mental health numbers more than I can count, been given the speech, been told ""we understand you're asking for help"" on my attempts, to the point where they don't even bother sectioning me or taking me to hospital any more they just tell emergency services to leave me at home. 

I feel let down, I feel I'm left alone to struggle. I'm tired of being asked what I want them to do to help, and then being told they can't do that because we must think longer term. It only takes one attempt for me to succeed in seriously hurting myself. In the moments I really need help, and don't get it, it makes me want to hurt myself out of pure spite to these services. 

Just today I was told that because I dont wake up early enough, I am not engaging and will be discharged if I don't fix my sleep. Despite attending 12 weeks of therapy and not missing one session, despite not missing one appointment with my care navigator, despite calling all of the helplines they give me before I take action, I'm not engaging. To them, non engagement must be the only reason I am not feeling better.

I'm sorry I'm just so sick of it honestly. I just want help and I want to stop being given the same bullshit when it comes to me being in a desperate situation."
Poor ability to recall memories after arguments?,27,mlgp97,8,"Whenever my boyfriend and I have an argument, I find that over the course of the few hours we fight, I begin to forget the beginning of the argument. The next day, it's like it never happened. Does this happen to anyone else?

For me, I know that it hurts him that I can't remember. One thing I do remember is that every time, he specifically says ""and the worst part is that you won't remember any of this tomorrow."" I don't consciously choose to forget! My brain just doesn't let me for whatever reason. Maybe I dissociate without realizing it, I don't know. I also have a hard time recalling memories from my childhood so maybe it's related? Anyone else also have problems with memories from their childhood???"
I’m so sick of reading stigmatising things about BPD!!,11,mlm8fy,5,"I literally hate some of the things I read about BPD. I was looking for articles/info online to give my friends about BPD so they know how it affects me and my relationships and so many of them say things that I just don’t feel is correct. For example describing relationships with us as “tumultuous” and “emotionally draining”. I mean I realise that difficulty in relationships is such a huge part of BPD, but so many of us work so, so hard to be the best people we can, and we also have even more love and empathy to give than other people! I just feel like it’s so unfair that it’s so easy to access articles online that say things like “manipulative” and “destructive” when most of us are just doing our best to navigate normal life with these intense emotions and feelings about people. Yes, BPD can be awful and cause us to act in ways we aren’t proud of, but we do our best to not let it control us and we have so much love to give. 

TL;DR- I’m a fucking good person and a great friend and I’m sick of reading about how difficult it is to know us."
Does anyone else not understand themselves ? One minute I’m head over heels for someone the next I’m repulsed :/,8,mlo89u,4,"I don’t know how to even explain this because I’m such a confusing person. If I confuse myself, how can I expect anyone else to understand me? I can’t believe I even act like this and I genuinely can’t help it. 

I’ll really like someone be all over them etc and vice versa then the next Im like ‘omg what in the hell, I defo don’t like you etc’ it’s like a cycle. I’m like this with family too... mind F*CK I tell you.  I don’t even think I’m capable of love because everytime it’s like ‘NEXT’.... sigh"
Ex asking to hookup update!!,10,mllnhw,4,"Guess what! 

Ex messaged me again asking to hookup after I ignored him the first time. Instead of ignoring him again I decided to give a mature (I think) message. 

“You used, manipulated, and lied to me. I spent so long healing and finally have moved on from you and you need to do the same thing, clearly sexually. You have no idea how badly you hurt me Jozef. Your actions traumatized me. 

You need to reevaluate yourself if you think this is okay to do. Frankly it’s disrespectful thinking I’m a disposable sex object here at your beck and call.”

“You waited three months to ask to hookup” 

Did I do okay? 

And I know for a fact that he read that shit because as I went to paste it and once again he said “never mind” after asking. Not even a minute later did I send my message. That’s how I know there is no way he didn’t see it. It shut him up and I don’t think he’ll ever message me again. 

For three months he has thought about me solely sexually, enough for him to ask twice. And I know he’s been pleasuring himself to the thought of me. The sad thing is that he probably didn’t delete my nudes when I asked. Makes me sick."
Dissociating during intimacy/sex?,9,mlmrgq,11,"The funny thing is I'm hypersexual. I frequently think about sex, just to not be fully present when it's actually happening. Every time things start heading there, or even when it becomes a possibility, my mind goes away and I shut down—even if I’m the one who initiated it. Thankfully this has never affected my performance though, because hey... my BPD brain needs that validation, right? LMAO.

I don't have any recollection of being sexually abused or assaulted, so... I seriously don't know what may be causing this, to be honest."
DAE find they can't explain themselves and their emotions to people?,29,mlcfzt,10,"It always seems like I can't explain myself, what I deal with and so on to many people. It's something that is consistent, and makes it hard to keep on going and explaining it to people. I just want to explain it so people understand more.

There's things like when you attempt to talk about what you go through and what not where it then gets lessened by the other person whether intentionally or not. Their responses like ""oh we all like that *sometimes*"", (I had another example on my mind but forgot), or they talk about how they are and what it's like in attempt to relate only for me to be sat there thinking ""you really don't understand what I said, or I explained it super poorly."" In the moment it can feel really invalidating, but as I have heard said before, people can only relate with their own experiences. 

When it comes to other people like on here or someone I know locally who has BPD, usually the blanks in explaination can be filled in and understood because well.. you are both dealing with the same beast. If that makes sense.

I just want people to understand, and to support me. Know that I spend almost all my time absorbed in something like a game or something else so that I don't think about things. Maybe, it would be nice if more people knew the chaos I was dealing with internally instead of just assuming.

Anyways, sorry for the long post. I just kind of want to know what others may experience on this. I love you all and I know there are some people here I have communicated with who have been wonderful."
DAE take FOREVER to get over an ex?,4,mlqhbe,3,"Bit of a rant here

Let me start out by saying I'm NOT like this with every guy. This in regards to someone you have an emotional attachment to and feel an attachment hunger for.

Its coming up on a year since my ex broke up with me. He's a PA. He went through my since deleted account after i specifically told him I wasn't comfortable with him looking at all of it. Its my fault for thinking I could trust him in the first place. We had sex and while I was asleep he went through my account. Reading things in regards to BPD I don't even remember writing. 

I had deleted the account after the initial encounter, my reason being if i was so concerned about him finding it I shouldn't have it. Unaware he'd already gone through it.

I've been in non consensual sexual situations. Ive had people I trusted betray me. I've been violated in many ways. This was something I've never experinced before. On a psychological, interpersonal, intellectual...and Idk what all other levels.

I'm so truamatized. Yet part of me still feels desperate for his attention. I wanted a different ending to the story, any ending where I'm not left feeling unwanted and abandoned.

Even worse. I haven't the motivation to go out and meet new people. If anything I'm simply terrified of getting hurt again. I feel abandoned and feeling abandoned makes me feel worthless and feeling worthless makes me feel like I want to act out in self destructive ways. Everytime he ignored me it validated that sense of worthlessness.

I know he never got off his multiple dating apps and had me replaced in a matter of days. I'm still sitting here a year later broken. Trapped in a past that doesn't care about me anymore. Feeling worthless over somebody I dont even want to be with forever, but him discarding me still hurts all the same. 

I want to cry. I feel pathetic. I haven't engaged in self harm since July. Even if I were to give into that urge it wouldn't change anything. Id feel worse, he wouldn't care. I don't think it will come to that. I just hate feeling this way. 

I feel so abandoned and it makes me feel so worthless and theres nothing i can do about it in regards to him. Why does my entire self worth have to revolve around somebody I don't even really like??? Part of me just wanted him to prove me wrong and be nice like he was in the very beginning but that never happened.

Thanks to anyone still reading. I think I just want to feel seen and heard instead of holding all of this in like I have been."
Do you guys realize how strong we are ?,523,mkwiyu,43,"We are one of the strongest human beings on the planet. Think about it,  it took me a long time to realize that. To wake up everyday and fight and fight and fight every second of the day is remarkable. We all know it can get unbearable at times , but no matter how many times we cry, or we hurt, or anything we always manage to get through it. So I just wanted to say that. I love every single one of you guys. We're all kind hearted people fighting a never ending war but at the end of the day we always win the battle (:"
DAE get upset remembering honeymoon phases of relationships?,20,mlewa8,8,"I started thinking about how my FP (also my significant other) used to call me almost every day and invite me over most nights. He would make an effort to cuddle with me frequently and he would video chat with me if we weren't able to see each other for a few days. He seemed generally happy and we had sex frequently.

It's been almost 3 years now and he keeps about half his clothes at my place, has a key, and keeps all his toiletries there so he basically lives with me part time, almost full time. He doesn't call me anymore, I always call him. He doesn't video chat me if we're apart for a few days. He basically puts in effort to give me attention every once in awhile, but it's not consistent like it used to be and our sex life has dwindled to almost nothing.

I understand that logically, people get comfortable together and stop putting in as much effort as they had to in the beginning of their relationships (whether it be friendships or romantic). I was mildly annoyed about our dwindling sex life, but I understand that fades naturally as well, even if I wish it didn't. I started reminiscing this morning about how things used to be and it sent me into a total panic. 

Has anyone else managed to upset themselves just by thinking about how things used to be?"
Hopeless Love,5,mlpnjg,2,"Does anyone else feel like no one will ever love you the way you love them? That you will never find that partner and your life will just be sad? I feel this way and sometimes I feel like there’s no point to anything if that’s the case. Just unmotivated because I don’t have someone to depend and love. Someone that can make me feel loved the way I want to make them feel loved.

It’s sucks that I can’t live properly without that special someone."
Trying to make music makes me want to kill myself every time,8,mln0l1,5,"I am
Trying to get good at making songs because I want to do it for a living and every time I try and I can’t get it right or I fail it makes me want to go jump off a bridge. I start to feel like a complete failure and that I’ll never accomplish anything and it just floods my mind with all these negative thoughts. I even get like this with a video game that I play too so it’s like anything I try to be good at if I feel I’m not good enough or if I can’t get something right it makes me really suicidal. Does anyone else experience this?"
I've just found out,28,mlc3gu,19,"I'm completely in shock. 

I've been looking for a diagnosis my whole life and my psych just casually throws it at me while we were on an unscheduled call just now. 

I want to call someone I love to celebrate but I don't know who to tell. I don't know who will understand how much of a relief it is to finally fucking know what's wrong with me. 

We even have a plan in place to start treating it right away, I'm already on my way to the pharmacy for new meds. 

Losing my mind with conflicting emotions right now but I really just want someone to talk to about it.

It's a beautiful day to be diagnosed!"
DAE feel like they don’t ever know how they truly feel?,3,mlqrum,0,"Whenever I split I feel so trapped in each viewpoint that I can be completely aware I will be trapped in the opposing viewpoint in no time but still cannot *feel* any differently in the moment; it’s torture. 

So which do I actually believe? Do I actually love them or hate them? Do I just feel both? Why can’t I see both sides at once? What is the difference between thought and feeling here? What is my true feeling if I can split and feel either/or so intensely?

I hope this post made some sense, I’m so frustrated with this disorder and having trouble understanding myself. I would pay big money for my thoughts and actions to be driven by fact and logic instead of emotion at this point."
Symptoms?,10,mlihc6,7,Does anybody else's BPD symptoms heighten during the time of their period? I find my emotions constantly changing during these times and i'm always on edge. I was just wondering if this happens to anyone else or if its just my meds not working anymore lol
Anyone else got a parent that's nice does the bare minimum?,7,mlkzob,1,"My mother raised me for the most part, but she doesn't really feel like my ""mom"" if you know what I mean. I turned 18 a few months ago and have sort of been living alone the past few years. It's complicated, but the simplest way I can put it is that I live at home while my mother stays in her boyfriend's apartment.

She pays the bills. Every two weeks I get a $100 for food (includes my cat). The rest of the time I don't see her or ask help with anything, and that's how it has been for three years. I know that I should be, and I *am,* very grateful that I have a roof over my head and food in the fridge.

I feel stupid for wanting more. I wish I could switch places with my cousin and soccer mom auntie. She cooks her daughter dinner and knows her friends, they even talk about the boys my cousin likes. They have a relationship. My mother hates hugs and has never said I love you."
All male BPD’s,28,mlbfxp,30,"I was just reading that BPD is most presented in women, which made me wonder about you guys.

Have you ever had a problem with getting help as it is an illness mostly common with women?

Do you experience it differently, for instance ADHD can be very different in women and men?

I never knew anyone else with this.  

@all Thank you"
Working on myself and hoping I won’t be a burden to my future partner,5,mlok4i,3,"I know it’s not a healthy mindset but I feel like if I’m not harsh on myself I won’t do what I need to do to help myself make my situation any better. 

I just want to be loved, and validated. 

Everyone who knows this tells me to love myself. 

I don’t know how to do that. I try to do what’s good for me, cut out what’s bad for me, look after myself, don’t let people mistreat me. I feel better about myself. But inside me there’s this sobbing, crying child that just wants a hug. And feels so alone. And I just want somebody to see that child and to love them. Because I can’t.

Every day I go through the storm alone and come out of the other end. I try to be strong. I rarely give up. And even when I do I know giving up isn’t the way. So I get back up. But I just hope there’s light at the end of the tunnel. Because I’m so tired of walking alone."
god complex w/ also low self esteem?,86,ml5dt6,11,"i have such low self esteem, like incredibly low. i get embarrassed over everything and the thought of ppl looking at me in public revolts me. but sometimes i get sudden god complexes and it really messes with me. i can go the whole day hating myself and looking at all my flaws and insecurities, but suddenly in the middle of the night i cant stop staring and thinking about myself. like i can look in the mirror all night. its so weird. idk if anyone else experiences this"
I need a virtual hug,7,mljwsl,3,"This is probably the worst day I've had this year. I don't know where to start. I just got off Spring Break and it usually takes me a while to get back into the swing of things. I thought that maybe I would've felt more relaxed after the break but Monday I completely slept almost all day. Today I woke up and tried to make an effort to be productive, but I got an email about one of my student loans and saw how much I owed and panicked. I talked to my mom about my loans and how I was freaking out over nothing and I guess she's right...but why don't I feel any better?

Not to mention that my FP always makes everything about himself. I thought that maybe just this once he would try to comfort me, but instead he talks about how anxious HE is. He does this whenever I'm upset. Every single time I'm upset, he gets upset, and then I have to take care of him. If I don't, things will only get worse (ie he'll have a huge panic attack or hurt himself). I'm so fucking sick of it. 

So I had a panic attack today. I walked out of the room away from him, because he always finds a way to freak out and turn my feelings against me. It's like I'm not allowed to feel fucking anything. Having panic attacks alone is terrible, and doubly so when you're afraid for someone else. 

I'm typing this as he has came back from having a cigarette and now he's on his stupid goddamn phone. I know if I call him out on it, he's going to talk about how it helps him with his anxiety and how he wants to talk to this person he ""hasn't talked to in a long time""--so that makes it okay. If I were to do that, he'd say I'm not being there for him. Fuck him.

I'm afraid for my life. I feel like I can't do this anymore. Why go to school if I'm not sure I'll even graduate? I'm racking up all this debt and for what? I don't know what I'm going to do with my life, and I wish I had someone here to comfort me. I don't know what to do--ever. 

I had to get this off my chest. Thanks for making it this far. I'd appreciate whatever messages you have."
BPD only occurs with romantic relationships,7,mlhx4n,5,"Does anyone else have completely normal friendships and relationships with people but when you find someone to date , you start splitting and overreact to things? When I’m not in a relationship I’m sad but usually ok. The relationships I have with people are normal and even kill. But when I’m in a relationship I go through so much rollercoasters! Does anyone else feel this way?"
Can I ever be loved in the same way?,2,mlr0am,1,"Seriously though? Can someone ever love me in the same way I love them? Or am I just doomed to always be the one in love? Like it's hurtful to realize they just don't feel the same and you have to accept that reality. I don't want to accept that reality because it means that I'm unwanted, unlovable. I don't want to live in that reality because it just fucking sucks. I will always just be some things people lives that they tolerate and get replaced later. It's unfortunate but that is apparently my role in others lives."
Overdoing it? Should I just leave it be?,4,mlmf1n,3,"Whenever anyone starts answering things half-assed I feel like it's my job to pick it up. Normally I do this by turning the convo to them and only them with a basic ""what are you doing rn"" question or in this situation just ""what's up with you"".

Then keeping the attention on them until either they change it or the conversation ends. 99.9999999% of the time it never goes back to me and it ends after a bit. (Sorry a bit off track their but I still feel it important)

My dad is just answering me ok. He wished me a good day, I answered with a sentence about my day then I get ok back. Talk about how I got a good hand mixer for a good price, ok. Then I brag about it a little breaking down just why it's so good, sounds good. 

Now I'm thinking of swinging to convo over to him. I don't want to because I'm always talking about him or others. It's never about me and when it is, it's forced and I get nothing. 

My sister can buy a 25 cent pencil and my dad would be praising her for just how perfect and amazing it is. Nobody cares about what I do no matter how big and impressive."
Me and the love of my life broke up.,11,mleedy,7,"I was so sure this was my one. This was my girl and I messed it up. I fucked it all up. 

God, I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself.

I wanna die. I actually want to stop breathing. It hurts too much anyway. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck."
Stuff I feel,2,mlpi2o,0,"Sometimes I read through symptom lists and feel horribly, horribly guilty, to my core, for having BPD (I'm not diagnosed but I have been suspecting it with increasing strength and frequency since 2019.) But then I remember that it's really not my fault in any true way, and was probably due to a duo of abusive, neglectful parents who could NEVER come out of themselves and truly love me. It always feels like something died inside of me because of this semihuman early life. I was on acid a few months ago and realised that this, combined with the fact they don't speak the same native language as me (this is immensely frustrating and actually legitimately damaging to development imo) and vice versa, meant that *there were and are no feedback loops between me and them*. 

I mean, imagine any sensible thing you say being met with a confused face and a ""huh? I don't understand"", or stonewalling as per my dad. I've read studies on how FUCKED UP the latter is, too. 

My point is, it's weird having your emotional life sort of fucking ruined by something adults could have prevented but you personally had 0 control over. I'm rotting in jail, life sentence, for a crime others committed. At least I have the freedom to make my jail comfy. 

Anyway, I feel most at peace when I'm doing random shit around the house and cooking or cleaning. I don't live on a diet of love... just comfort and stability. I feel most at peace when things are nice and calm. 

I think I've realised in the past few weeks that everyone just gotta make do with their psychic construction and it's futile and agonizing trying to aim for perfect psychological health. Why? 

From 14 I knew I had problems with being able to love, and this tortured me for years. But why do I torture myself for something I can barely control, and why do I even want to be able to love in the first place, exactly...? Why? Why do anything? 

I don't want kids. I don't think I'm, at least as of now, capable of romantic love at all. I don't have enough within me for anything more in the long term future probably than friends, a casual bf and a pet. Anything more than that and I'll get real fucking destructive- but this amount of and distance of relationships seems like it will be a possible equilibrium for me.

There is no point trying for further. It's not my fault I have this condition. I value my own peace of mind first and foremost and I disagree with the mainstream pressures to always aim for the theoretical best (because it makes you feel guilt af you're not there or aiming for it) when I have been left emotionally foundationless. 

I feel like I don't owe it to anyone to live my life in such a way that could be looked up to by others, whereas I have felt this pressure in the past. I think there is a quiet virtue in living the best life you can for your circumstances that are out of your control. 

But at the same time I also feel like I'm giving up on life and love and being loved. Like I'll decay if I ignore emotions and relationships and retreat into my own little world. Like it'll feel like escaping reality and living a lie and pretending death isn't real. 

But maybe it's not as hard as I think. Argh... I'll hand it over to my therapist. I have no idea."
Can’t stop ruminating,7,mlfjys,2,"I can’t stop thinking about her. It’s just constant intrusive thoughts about her, obsessively going over in my head what happened, what was said, how it was said, memories and things that aren’t even really significant. I can’t stop thinking. Almost all my thoughts go to her and I’ve been doing more drugs recently just to quiet my mind. It was working for a bit but now it’s not enough. I feel pathetic cause I can’t help it. All I want is to not think about her but my head just won’t turn off. Sometimes I’m not even seeing things as they are and I’m so mad that my reality seems warped. It’s fucked up cause I’m the one who ended things yet I’m still hung up and still in a lot of pain. I can convince myself of what’s true, why I did what I did, convince myself things will be okay again and I can move on only to wake up the next morning feeling the complete opposite. Hopeless, angry and bitter. 

I don’t have a best friend anymore cause I had to cut things off, it wasn’t easy for me to see my ex/fp move on. I don’t have any friends cause the only other one I had lives far away and never attempts to message first. They’re going through their own stuff I guess but this has left me feeling rejected by everyone. While I crave connection I don’t want it at the same time because connection is hell for me. It always turns into something unhealthy and these days I seem more mentally ill than ever. So I’m in a constant cycle of wanting to meet people, needing to, trying and then ultimately giving up because a fear of rejection and knowing what it will turn into. I can’t even stay sober long enough to remember to reply to people. I’m just really alone and I feel worthless and unloveable. I can’t connect with others and no one wants to connect with me. I feel like a terrible person. I feel crazy. I feel stupid. And posting this is going to make me feel even more stupid"
Agh why do i hate some people for no reason?,2,mlowa7,0,"So i started a new job this week and so far it's been pretty hard but i'm managing as best i can and my hours are good so i'm keeping positive. But there's this manager at work and she is ALWAYS there during my shifts, I hate her so much. I have no idea why because she is relatively friendly to me, she even trained me. But I hate her and her presence triggers such bad anger and anxiety for me. Why do I feel like this? And also if you ever felt like that, how do you cope with it or what do you tell yourself to make yourself like the person more?"
How the fuck do I make money?,4,mljpjx,3,"18TF. If I could get a job, I wouldn’t be able to keep it, but I can’t get that far. I don’t have transportation anyway. Everyone says to freelance, but I don’t have the fucking energy. And my coping mechanism is “add to cart,” so I really don’t know what the fuck to do. Has anyone else been in this situation? What did you do to not be destitute?

EDIT: I’m not doing something that requires me to live to work. Fuck that. I couldn’t bring myself to. Like literally, my brain wouldn’t let me. Life was meant for more than eating, shitting, sleeping and working."
Well meaning friends upset with my isolation.,2,mlnyvw,0,"Last week was pretty bad for me. I got in a fight with my family which ended up in me going on a pretty bad drug binge. Worse than normal. Ive been off my meds for years. I'm just trying to hold it together until I see my new doctor on the 26th. 

In order to keep my job and extension my home, I've been staying home and watching TV. I also keep up with my chores. Most of my friends understand this. But my newer friends can't seem to grasp it no matter how I explain it. Recovering this time around has been way more difficult than any episode I've had previously. Does anyone have advice on explaining this? I try my best but I guess I appear high enough functioning to where me explaining just doesn't land for them. It's a sad ugly existence. I can't help that solitude is the only thing that keeps it together for me. My biggest fear is ending up jobless and homeless."
What do you do in order to cope with the guilt and shame for the things you did to your partner that was brought on by their emotional instability?,5,mlivcx,2,"As a nonBP I’ve done things I’m not proud of. Responded to things too aggressively. Not held her when she was sad bc I was hurting too. Things I would never do under “normal” circumstances. Things that hurt my exwBPD. Real or imagined. Things that have “crushed” her and taken her “will to live”. I feel guilty. I feel her pain. And of course she felt pain that was 100x what a normal person would feel. I care about her and despite a heartfelt apology I still had these things thrown back in my face in the end. I never cheated on her or lied to her or degraded her as a person. In fact we had several conversations about her past sexual history and I never once made her feel bad about it. 

But, I don’t know where to begin to forgive myself. It’s really deep. I’m a good person. I don’t do things “to her” in a vacuum or maliciously and in at least one case she was a willing participant. The chaos and the emotions that came from the instability of her disease affected how I treated her in return. She was absolutely no angel and has no insight on her volatility bc she has no understanding of just how unhinged she was. No frame of reference.

That fight or flight reaction i got isn’t rational and when I was constantly under attack i was bound to make a mistake eventually. Mistakes of course were lorded over me forever and were brought back at all the worst times. I only ever remember the good times and she only remembers trauma. Seemingly, my ex never applied the same pressure to herself when evaluating how toxic she was towards me at her worst and what it did to me. Never held herself to account and applied the same unforgiving attitude. 


I smiled and sat there at our final lunch together and i listened to all of her grievances without a semblance of self reflection on her part. No acknowledgement for the hell I dealt with.  It was all about her and her feelings and what I did to her even when she was accusing me of being selfish. The ultimate irony. I served tables for a decade and kept my resolve and forced a smile on my face and told her she will always hold a special place in my heart even though I doubt she’ll ever feel the same way despite our 1.5 years together. 

It was hard but I feel like in the end I was the only one that was held to account for the chaos that WE were a victim to. Her disease stole a beautiful opportunity from us and I’m bitter and resentful about that more than anything. It’s just hard to forgive myself when i look back and it feels like I’m the only one that made mistakes."
Is it normal to cry because someone pointed out something about you?,17,ml8gc0,16,"I practically cried for hours straight and starved myself for weeks because right after I came back from ditching all my mates for a whole month, they made a comment about me being fat while I was already starving myself most days and losing weight rapidly but I still went back to them a while after that happened but I still starve myself. Is it bad or am I normal for a person with bpd?"
When your parents found out you had BPD how did they react ?,3,mlk4ep,5,I was watching a Documentary one time of a football player who had BPD and I was like I totally relate to everything they were saying on the doc. I suggested to my mom that I may have BPD and she told me in a very harsh tone that nothing was wrong with me. I was 14 fast forward 7 years and I get diagnosed with it. ( My mom to this day denies I have no mental health issues even after I been diagnosed)
i am ruining my reputation at my job,1,mlr17t,0,"i work a restaurant minimum wage job, and it’s been having a strain on my mental health. i feel that i am being taken advantage of and i’m starting to have a hard time controlling my emotions at work. every time i try to talk to my manager about how i feel i’m always shut down with how much more she has to do for the store and how much longer she works. i understand she deals with a lot but i am not a manager and i didn’t sign up to fill in the gaps for everyone else. the worst part is that i’ve began thinking that i can only function at work if i’m on drugs which has led me back to abusing my adhd medication. 
i’m so upset all of the time at my job. i don’t enjoy it at all and i don’t know what to do. i know it’s minimum wage but it’s what’s paying the bills right now and i don’t have a place to go yet. but i don’t even know if it’s my job that’s the issue or if i’m just making it seem worse than it actually is. i’m worried that one day i’m not going to be able to control myself and i’m just going to walk out and regret everything.
it’s so exhausting trying to put on a good face for people that i don’t give a single shit about."
self hatred and feeling entirely unloved,3,mljlqs,4,"I'm sure a lot of you feel this way too. Before my diagnosis, I was always wondering why I had always hated myself. It had always felt like I was born with self hatred, and I don't think I've ever experienced self love. As for feeling unloved, do any of you feel *entirely* unloved? It obviously has to do with the self hatred, but I've always felt that way. My parents aren't the best, especially my mom, but my childhood wasn't dark (even though I don't remember most of it), and I was told loving and uplifting things for most of it. The main and one of the only things I remember from my childhood is how dark my thoughts were, though. I barely even spoke as a child because I felt like I didn't deserve to exist. I still feel like that now, as a 22-year old. I know that BPD can come with these thoughts, but has anyone experienced them so deeply and strongly almost every day since they were born? I've been loved before, I know that, but not by many people, and either way I never felt like I deserved it. I have a partner now, and she's very loving, but I don't even feel loved by her anymore because I'm probably the lowest I've ever been. Can anyone relate to any of this?"
my mom makes me feel like i’m not good enough to have friends.,2,mlm6xg,1,"I recently made a new group of friends and they are genuinely HEAVEN SENT. such blessings in my life. they are beautiful people. we decided to get each other easter baskets with tons of gifts, so, i went out to buy things for them. for one friend, i got them a little crystal for $18. i asked my mom if she thought it was cute, and she said that me spending money on these “people” was extremely weird and that i was only buying them “expensive” things so that i could BUY their friendship. her comment made me extremely upset and embarrassed. she thinks that i’m not worthy enough of people liking me. apparently the only way people will like me is if i buy them stuff. i’m so humiliated. i’ve never had friends like this before and my mom knows it. i don’t know why she makes me feel stupid for having friends, and i don’t know why she acts like my friends don’t actually like me."
acceptance,6,mlcwbs,2,"I was thinking about this... all my past relationships.. family, some friends, and boyfriends have all used my mental health against me. I’ve told them and confided in them and trusted them. a lot I didn’t even tell I had BPD, I mostly just said I had anxiety and depression because of the stigma that BPD gets. but they even used those things against me and called me crazy and it’s just stuck with me. 

now I’m at the point where I’m 21 years old and I think I completely loathe myself. honestly, I’m at a point where my life is completely coming crashing down. and I’m not sure if this cycle will ever stop. I need to learn how to manage these emotions and not be so self destructive in the ways that I cope. 

all i think about myself are negative things. and it’s gotten to the point where I don’t even know who I am anymore or what to believe about myself. I’m in a complete mental crisis and I just don’t know how to come out on the other end."

How do you guys handle the feeling of shame,2,mllggj,0,Lately I have not been able to handle it. It's debilitating and all I can think about. It's affecting my day to day life. It's obsessive thoughts and I feel like I am losing my mind. I don't know what to do any more. Please help. Any tips?
Euphoria Scarier Than Depression,1,mlq3q2,0,"Dunno if this is how anyone else feels, but I would much rather have depression than euphoria. At least with depression I feel ""attached"" to my thoughts and actions, with euphoria I feel like moving through quicksand trying to connect and feel grounded. Depression is thinking dark thoughts, but euphoria is thinking those same thoughts while staring off into space for hours with a smile on your face. Depression and anxiety is being afraid of intrusive thoughts, euphoria is laughing at them but still believing them to be true. 

It took me years to learn that my body's natural reaction to severe sleep deprivation is a euphoric state, rather than irritable. All it takes for me is less sleep, more sunlight, and too much caffeine and I might as well be high on something. And it's scary as hell to think about the the patterns and decisions we make in our lives without even being aware that there's something not quite right in our brains."
I told a friend,1,mlpz22,2,I told a friend that I had bpd and explained how I usually automatically put up a personality for everyone for them to like me or like a reflection of that other person’s personality and they called me fake and they haven’t talked to me and wont anymore.

Well shit...,5,mlcqbr,1,"Hiya reddit. I’m a 28F and was recently diagnosed with BPD after a breakup led me to a fit of rage in which I punched a doorway and broke my hand. 

I can’t even begin to express my gratitude for finding this community. There are some struggles, like favorite person obsessions and extreme romantic fantasies, that made me feel so alienated and broken and weird. I also find it amazing how we all seem to write and compose our thoughts similarly. I bet we share a lot of the same gifts as well as challenges. 

I’m posting today because I’m at the stage in diagnosis where I’m feeling hopeless. I’m currently single, unemployed, slowly chipping away at my graduate degree and raising a beautiful 3yo daughter while I attempt to get my shit together. Now that I’m acknowledging my disorder, it feels like this insurmountable obstacle. I need some encouragement. Is anyone out there doing alright? Happily partnered? Made it through grad school? Kicking it unmedicated? Raising kiddos successfully? 

Please share your wins... I need to see them. I’m starting to feel like this BPD situation is going to keep taking everything from me and I’m terrified of treading in place until I die."
What are some tips to step away when you start to feel an episode begin?,1,mlp7hs,0,"I (23F) have a bad habit of blowing up at my BF (25M) we’re long distance and I always will text super fast without thinking during episodes when I’m triggered by something he does. 

Is it as simple as bringing my phone upstairs to my room and leaving it there? Or is there something else I can do also to relax my mind and let the feelings pass so I don’t do any further damage to my relationship? 

It’s to the point where he can’t take my episodes any longer and I feel like I have no self control. 

Therapy hasn’t been helping, and my DBT doesn’t start until next month."
My brain couldn't have chosen a worse FP,7,mlb97p,4,"I met a boy online in a mental health venting community about a month ago, and it turned out we lived really close so we've met up twice since then as well as just messaging every single day. He's the most caring person I've ever met, as well as really cute, charismatic, funny, just perfect. I developed a crush as well as an intense FP attachment to him extremely fast.

The problem is he's severely depressed, has attempted suicide more times than I can count only since I've met him, and isn't ready to accept any kind of help. I've tried (and failed) to help him through suicidal nights a few times and I feel completely helpless because I've realized there's nothing I can do to help him. I have since told myself that I can't try to talk people out of suicide again because it puts a massive toll on me, but it's so hard to see him in pain.

We have good communication and have talked a lot about our friendship, and last night it came to a point where he told me he knows how much seeing him in pain hurts and worries me and he doesn't want to put that stress on me anymore. I'm so terrified that this means he's about to abandon me ""for my own good"" or something. I've tried communicating how deeply attached I am to him but I'm scared of explaining the FP thing because I don't want to scare him off. But he's convinced I'd be better off without him and I'm broken. He's 90% of what I think about and I don't know what I'd do if he left me and I had no indication of whether he's even still alive. This hurts so much."

"What to do when the doctors won’t screen you for BPD again even though you’ve been diagnosed with it before, and you’re really suffering from divergent behavior patterns?",1,mlohnk,1,"I was diagnosed with BPD a few years ago. Then I got another diagnosis whereafter the BPD diagnosis got invalid according to the doctors. Now they won’t examine/screen me for BPD again, but I’m pretty certain that I have it as almost all the symptoms match. I’m really suffering from major mood swings, anger outbursts and weird behaviors such as screaming at my husband over the phone and throwing soda in his garage because he was out with his friends and I was scared that he was with other girls. I know I’m crossing a line, but I can’t control it which is why I consider myself to have divergent behavior patterns. This is just one example out of many. What should I do in this situation?"
whats going on,1,mlog9y,0," 

so my partner has been off with me for weeks but she says she is just stressed and worried about everything but hardly talks to me about stuff and just says shes fine when you can clearly see shes not.

I keep trying to make plans and the best i get is a maybe, like it would be nice to know what i am doing etc.

the main thing is today, she blanks me for hours then tells me to shush every time i message her while shes out with her friends, yet she is constantly on her phone when she is around me, like rather than tell me she is busy she just tells me to shush and then ignores me when i ask why.

idek i just needed to rant. I want things to work out but im getting the feeling that she is pulling away."
Abilify (Ariliprazole) for emotional/rejection sensitivity?,0,mlo4gs,1,"A couple days ago I (19F) was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 and they prescribed me Abilify. I read that Abilify also helps for symptoms of BPD (which I’m not diagnosed with, but I have a lot of). I’ve been taking 5mg for that past 2 days, but I’m looking forward to things not hurting me anymore. If the things in my life can’t change for the better, I figure I can at least change the way I feel about them/how they affect me emotionally. Have any of y’all taken Abilify and saw any change in that department?"
DAE do not know if your feelings are true?,2,mliw11,0,"I have been in relationships since I'm 15. Looking back i think I was not single for more than 2 weeks.
I had a 1,5 years, 10 years, 3 years and now 2 months relationship.

Usually I only get the courage to end a relationship when I feel I can trust the ""next"" one. I know, it's terrible and i feel guilt about that.

No boyfriend ever wanted to break up with me. They always tried to win me back. I thought it was because I am perhaps a good person to be with but i realize now it's just trauma bonding 

I now started a new relationship and I think I give my soul to my partner. I pay attention to everything they say. I try their hobbies. I get close to their family (i have no family so i always want to be close to my partner family). I offer 100% of support. I get close to their friends as well and disregard my own friends.

It was the birthday of my boyfriend and i went completely overboard. Bought 7 gifts,  baked a personalized cake .. and we are only two months together.

I know it is probably bpd but i love this men so much. How do I know if my feelings are true? I didn't say i loved him yet, but i do. I think about growing old together, about traveling and i can see all of this happening.

I'm just so worries there will be a day i will start painting him all black. Then i feel like I don't love anymore. I don't want to start the cycle again. I had amazing partners before and i left them because there were some things that didn't work. Instead of fixing these issues i moved to the next one...

How do You differenciate real love from bpd love?"
The big empties,1,mlns16,0,"Hey frands,

Im trying to figure out what’s going on when I get the empties—you know the feeling.

I think it might have something to do with a lack of connection and validation. Possibly a lack of continuity and security—a lack of the sense that I am understood, loved, valued, safe—that I am standing on solid ground. 

I wonder if it’s not the ground that needs to be solid, but me that has to be ready for it to drop out, and know I’m gonna be ok, that I can handle it without help from anyone. 

I came up with this thing re: a sense of self, informed by some reading, my own experiences and the input of my fabulous therapist: 

Agency: Capable, confident and competent: a sense that I am going to be able survive, thrive, meet my goals, that i am valid, worthy, competent and capable

Validation: a sense that I am valid, loved and understood; sense that there are people who love me, that not just my emotions are valid, but my experiences, my whole self; a sense that I am loved, not « loved despite », but just loved; a sense that people understand me when I speak, that there are people who see the good in me and the value of my contribution 


Continuous & connected: a sense of who I am persisting despite big changes in the landscape of my life, despite grief, crisis and loss of loved ones. A sense that I am connected to this sense of persisting self and to others around me.


I’d say I’m working towards all of those pretty consistently, but that none of them are where they need to be. 

Without any specific external stimulus, sometimes I get this rattling emptiness. It feels like a disconnect, it feels like hopelessness and loneliness. It feels like emptiness, but it’s certainly not the absence of emotion, is it? 

I was wondering what you guys feel about the big empties—is it something missing, or something present? And what helps you when you feel that way?

Thanks!"
anyone else with bpd struggle with nightmares?,22,ml4s1w,12,"i have horrible nightmares usually multiple times a week sometimes i have them every day for a while or every other day, whenever i get upset at a fp or i think they are going to leave i will get a nightmare of them going missing or dying, im not sure if this is related to bpd or not so i was wondering if anyone else here struggles with nightmares?"
how to handle partner splitting,0,mln5hi,4,what's a good way to handle your bpd partner splitting on you? I love my gf dearly but when she's angry she can be so hurtful and it's hard to not react to her and then have her blame me for getting mad in return. she can love me one day and the next act like im the worst person ever and idk how to handle the value/devalue swings
Is it true we won’t be able to have children?,1,mln54r,2,"I’ve heard that if you get pregnant while single and have BPD, a social worker has a strong chance of taking your baby away. And you can’t adopt for sure. I totally get it because having a personality disorder and raising a child would be HELL and so unfair to the child, but I would want to raise it to be happy and not at all like my parents raised me. I always planned on adopting. 

Ive been in therapy for it and have made tremendous progress, but I’m far from perfect and won’t be for a longgg time. Even if I’m totally recovered in like eight years, would they even let me adopt because I have a past of BPD and possible self destructive behavior?"
On the verge of breaking point,1,mlmxkn,1,"So, where do I start?

• My homophobic brother not only doesn't accept my gender identity & sexual orientation, but he also takes the mick out of my beliefs, then says ""it's just friendly sibling banter""
• I feel like I'm treading on eggshells whenever friends and family find out what I do for volunteering (well, I label it as volunteering to make my life easier)
• I've been having a really crap 24 hours with voices in my head, being close to losing my temper, etc...
• And then a couple of hours ago, our family dog started having a seizure, and I somehow was able to be there, despite literally just starting to have a panic attack in the kitchen

So yeah.... Gotta love life, ey? 😅😫"
Living in an apartment with ex-fiance of 5 years and their significant other with months left on lease,0,mlmvdy,0,"The title is the TL;DR of my situation, and I'm trying to figure out how to cope as I feel I've been spiraling worse lately and I'm afraid I'll say or do things I can't come back from. It's pretty long as I'm giving quite a bit of background so I appreciate if you make it all the way through.

I was with a partner for 5 years, and have known them for 9. They were my best friend. We've lived together for nearly 3.5 years. We planned on getting married; we were engaged and had an idea of the future together. Our relationship had it's issues and we both could have been better to eachother, me more so given my disorder, but also because we started dating as kids and are in our early 20s now; people change and grow.

My ex was poly and had feelings for other people during the span of our relationship, but never acted on them. That was a lot to deal with, and compartmentalize. About 8 months ago, I learned they had feelings for a coworker of theirs we had been hanging out with. And I thought maybe I could too, so I agreed to open our relationship and to mutually date this coworker. 

I spiraled a lot in that relationship, and got really bad for both myself and my partner(s). The coworker agreed to the relationship but very obviously only had feelings and inclinations towards my ex long term partner, and I was being gaslit (since apologized to) as to the imbalances I was noticing, and that I was asking for too much. My ex-long term partner tried to hold it together but we were already rocky as it was. When I mentioned going back to monogamy, that I couldn't handle polyamary, that I wanted things to be like how they were, ex-partner said that it wouldn't be fair to coworker, and they wouldn't just cut him off like that. That ""things change"" and when pressed, I learned they didn't want to get married to me anymore either because it wouldn't be fair; basically pulled the rug out from under me on the future we had had planned together in the 3 years prior.

I mourned that relationship, and what it used to be. I was chatting, venting and generally hanging out with a coworker (current partner) of my own for a few months leading up that I thought was becoming me new FP...turns out I was starting to crush on him especially in the latter half of the thruple relationship, at my lowest. So I asked both partners if I could pursue it, so that we could all have a slice of happiness and I wasn't such a mess at home. Two weeks into relationship with current partner, I broke up with thruple coworker but stayed with ex-long term partner.

Ex-long term forbade current partner from coming over, and partaking in hobbies that ex-long term and I would do together like cosplay or certain games. I tried to respect it because I know what I felt to feel jealous and protective of things like that. But I felt this was unfair as I was living with ex-long term and their boyfriend, who I felt did me dirty, and yet I was still being cordial. They told me it wasn't unfair because they couldn't help that he lived here; but the idea that I have to be around their boyfriend, and an ex of mine, while being unable to invite my own boyfriend over felt really unfair.

It was rocky obviously. And then I learned I wasn't actually poly and couldn't handle two relationships, especially with one that wasn't a thruple. I wanted to be fair to current partner as I felt I was being unfaithful somehow still dating ex-long term, despite current partner's complete acceptance, reassurance and understanding of the poly situation and things I've vented about previously. I wanted to have a future with current partner and I didn't want the mess that I was still clinging to from my previous relationship to scare him off, or make him feel like he didn't have my focus or love. I was confused and upset and anxious as fuck at my options, but I just felt so much better with current partner.

So I broke it off with ex-long term after they had been expressing grievances about my lack of reciprocation / not being able to be the partner I once was, but I couldn't parse my own feelings. I still love them, but I didn't know if I was in love, and I didn't want to ruin a good thing with current partner. Ex-long term partner told me that no one would be able to handle my disorder like they could, but have since apologized for such a toxic comment. Ex-long term begged me, told me they wouldn't want to be friends with me if we broke up when that's all I really wanted, and I sat on it for awhile, and after consulting current partner if I could try again, and getting the reassurance and okay for it, we tried again.
But I was still bitter about the relationship I had mourned, and how I was treated (and treated them) in the thruple relationship, and I still couldn't be the partner they wanted. I loved them but wasn't in love. Every time we were together, it was a new argument. We always argued, but it was more now. And finally, they broke it off with me, after writing a long list of things about me that irritated them, that they've since apologized for. And said that we should not be bitter like we were last time, when I wasn't bitter in the first place, just confused with so many life changes in so little time, and tried to have it be amicable. That we could still be friends and they just needed time to parse how they felt and grieve what they were afraid of.

It felt unfair somehow...even though it wasn't, rationally. There is no fair or unfair in things like this. That now that it was on ex-long term partner's terms, I wasn't allowed to be bitter or upset.
They promised they wouldn't ghost me as they have issues with doing that to others, and we own pets together, so they would send me some pictures of the pets a couple days after this. It seemed like it was sort of a segway to normalcy.

I'm good friends with all of my exes, and I thought that's where this was going. It's easy for me to bounce back to 'normal'...if anything, still being friends and not pretending like there wasn't history makes it so much better than just not, for me at least. It keeps negativity and bitter feelings from arising. I know everyone isn't like that. 
 
Communication eventually died down to nothing. They start ignoring messages, even messages about pets. I noticed I was softblocked on a website we used together when I wasn't a few days before. I got obviously upset, and I sent some long messages when I spiraled one night, nothing bitter or sinister but long, frustrated and confused, about the distance and the living situation and how I was being treated like a ghost now in the household, how I felt it was being put on me to find out when it's appropriate to be friends again.
Not only mourning 5 years of a relationship but 9 years of a friendship on my side. 

Was responded to being told this was one of the reasons they broke up with me; my long winded messages at early hours of the morning (despite a majority of our arguments being initiated from them; have no had any arguments with current partner like I did with ex-long term.) And how they need no contact to cope, but they didn't initially express that to me. And us living together makes that especially difficult, having to see eachother.

I come out of my room to hear them venting to their boyfriend in the living room, a space we can all come into, and I catch them say, ""I don't owe them anything, I'm tired of it!"" in regards to my message
I am not proud of my reaction that day. They told me not to interject in their conversation, but it was a conversation in a living space and felt I had every right to speak my mind. I'm a firm believer that there's a minimum you owe someone, especially with history.

I blew up, and they blew up back to me and we yelled at eachother back and forth. I made threats telling them I would make their life a living hell if this was going to be how they were going to treat me in the apartment after all of our history; like someone they didn't know, cold and uncaring. I'm not proud of it and apologized after 11 days of getting my mind together, and was ignored.

They say to respect what they need to cope, but tell me they don't owe me anything. And I can't handle no contact...a lack of normalcy makes me vindictive and bitter.
I have to respect what they need while ignoring my own needs, and my mention of that had them telling me to stop making myself the victim.

They need no contact to cope but that's impossible living together. We have two other roommates as well who I am moving in with when our lease is up, but I feel bad they've had to witness the mess that's been happening in the past half year. They've been there for both of us seperately, but one roommate has known me for 12 years so he's more inclined to sticking around with me. 

I told ex-partner calmly for the second time to start getting their clothes and such out of my room today. If we were on better terms, I wouldn't mind them leaving their things here because they really don't have a lot of space in their room with their boyfriend. But I can't cope having all of their stuff cluttering my living space, especially when I'm trying to be around more often.
They agreed to it but said I was being vindictive, but I reminded them that they said they didn't owe me anything, and I didn't owe them my living space.
It turned into another conversation about letting things settle, and no contact, and it got heated. They have a way of pushing blame onto me, and saying I need to take accountability but I feel they never take accountability, or realize when they're making themselves the victim as well. 
They told me they don't understand how I don't understand that they don't want to talk to me, and that this is why they dread talking to me. A total turn around to the bullshit they told me when they broke up with me, like cusion.
I just feel like they're taking a coward's way out for it all but I'm trying to be respectful...it's just really hard.

How do I deal with this ? I've been staying at my current partner's place a lot, and honestly I'm much happier in this relationship than I've been in awhile...I could gush and gush about all of the good things. He gets me, our love languages match, we can have conversations instead of arguments, we just...match. Ex-coworker partner told me I was too fat for him, despite having worked on my weight and having an eating disorder (which was jump started again after that comment). When I confided in my now current partner about that months before we were dating, his response was to tell me I was perfect the way I was, how shitty a comment like that was from someone who's supposdd to support and love you, but most of all, that if I wanted to get in shape, he'd work out with me. That was the positivity and support I needed in my life and he's been just as supportive now as he was then. He's like a sunflower and I just want to be around his warmth all the time.
But I don't want to rely on him as much as I did with ex-long term partner; I don't want him to feel smothered with my problems. And I especially don't want to get hurt...or to split and hurt him. I've been trying to look into therapy. It's been 3 months and my love keeps growing stronger, but I can't just live at his place and I'm afraid he'll see how bad of a person I am over time. I don't want to ever feel like I wasn't enough like I did in past relationship, enough for ex-long term partner to obviously want to date other people. I have to be back at my apartment sometimes. But every time I'm here and I see ex-long term and their boyfriend, I just get so angry. Especially with the no contact."
Every time I get into an argument with my partner I want to break up,1,mlmgs3,1,"I feel like I’m constantly cycling between optimism and wanting to fix things, and wanting to just end the relationship. In my heart I want us to fix things and just be happy together, but there are very real issues between us that can never seem to leave my mind. At some point, it came to be that every big argument we have leads to me asking if they just want to leave me, and going through all the reasons why we shouldn’t be together. I really think that I’m not good for them, I’m the first girlfriend they’ve ever had (we’re in our early-mid 20s), and I feel like that hinders their ability to see how things are. Sex, money and mental illness are our main problems, and those are pretty big things, but despite that I just want us to be able to come back to the love and happiness we used to share. One minute all I can think about is how sweet and wonderful and patient they are, and the next moment I’m reminded of our issues and feel like the whole thing is doomed. I hate that this is going to be what they base their future relationships on if we break up, I hate that I’m responsible for shaping their idea of love. I feel so incredibly guilty, and they still want to work on things, and a big part of me wants to as well, but then the other side of me wants to prevent any further suffering on their part. I would love and greatly appreciate any advice!"
I'm 99% sure my fucking stalker just called me *Trigger Warning*,0,mlmdo2,1,"Triggers for blood, suicide, stalking. Please no telling me ""change your number,"" ""go to the cops,"" ""just move,"" it is so much easier said than done.

Long story short, me and this girl were friends until I realized how toxic of a person she was and I cut her off. She used 3 different phone numbers to call me, she said she would show up at my house if I didn't talk to her, she would try to use my friend to contact me, she would do what I did when I was 18, but worse. She would constantly invite herself over, forcing herself into plans that I would have to face the consequences of when she told my parents she didn't have a way home.  She would just take my stuff and say ""oh well, you don't use it, do you? It looks the exact same as last time."" She would guilt trip me into giving her things, she would make me feel like shit in order to make it so I wouldn't stray from her. She would tell me that no one liked me except her, guys only talked to me for sex, money or for a joke. She didn't even like my ex because she didn't introduce him to me and was constantly telling me that her friend would be a better match, knowing that I wouldn't end the relationship if I got into it because I was too scared to lose her friendship. She would talk so much shit about him, but then act like his friend to his face. She would constantly tell me that he was cheating on me. One night, after me and him broke up after the second time we dated, I said he was a bit of an asshole sometimes. My best friend since the fourth grade and mother both said if he made me happy, then they're happy. But what does this bitch say? ""I told you so."" This stupid piece of fucking shit texted me one day saying ""hey, come over, I'm having a panic attack."" I had my dad drive me over, go into her room. She had cut herself and had me clean up the blood. She had notes for everyone and insisted I read her note as I was cleaning her blood. She told everyone that her ex boyfriend broke up with her because he had another girl. Nope. She broke up with him to fuck his best friend who had feelings for her. We met in the 6th grade and she got mad because I found a pen that she decided she liked. I went to the bathroom and she flirted with a guy in the class to take it. I asked for it back and she gaslighted me, ""it was my pen, I lost it last week or maybe you stole it."" We had an assignment in social studies the next day and we fucking bombed it because she was a petty piece of shit who refused to say any of the lines for a skit we had to do on the Black Plague. In the 7th grade, she went to a different school. 8th grade, she came back and sat with me and another friend, throwing small bits of food at me to try and piss me off. 9th grade, she acted as if none of that happened and we were the best of friends. It took me until the second year of college to realize how toxic of a person she was.

I have so many fucking stories about this piece of shit she was such a manipulative cunt and I ended up being her lapdog.

My dad saw her a few months ago at her job because he needed something. He told me what happened, he said ""hi Stalker"" and she goes ""how do you know my name?!"" He thought wtf you were my daughter's friend, but said ""you have a name tag."" She responds with ""oh yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting"" and I guess told him a story about how she had a ""mini stroke"" and doesn't remember anyone or anything.... except she has these prom photos with this one girl who she feels such a strong and special connection with.

But if you don't remember anything.... how do you know those were prom photos? I know I burned all the ones I had because you forced your way into the fucking photos because ""WE WERE LIKE SISTERS!"" and I couldn't even have one photo by myself, I couldn't even get one with the guy I liked who I ended up dating for a few months, without her guilt tripping me. My mom didn't pay for any of the fancy borders, nothing that said PROM 2015 or CLASS OF 2015, not even a prop sign in the back that said 2015, I wore a short mint dress, and it was at the aquarium.

So, how do you remember it was prom?

If you had a stroke that made you not able to remember anything from your past? How do you remember it was Prom.......?

She continued to tell my dad that her mom wanted her to take the photos down, but she wants to know who this girl was. My dad came home and told me what happened and that I probably shouldn't go in that store again.

Now, I know it's stupid to pick up phone numbers you don't know, but my work has like 4 different phone numbers and I don't save my coworkers' phone numbers so I don't accidentally call them, so I have a habit of picking up just subconsciously when I hear my ringtone. When I pick up the phone, sometimes it's a spam call, other times it's a legit call and other times, it's just silence. So what I've been doing sometimes is to say her name and tell her to leave me alone. Most of the time, my phone hasn't been by my face as I would hang up, but today I said it into the phone.

I said ""Stalker, leave me al-"" and then it hung up.

It was her. I'm telling y'all, it was fucking her. It's always been her. Every call that has been silent after me saying hello twice, it was her.

I still have the phone that has texts and screenshots of everything that happened. I should've gotten a restraining order when it was at its peak, but I stupidly didn't.

I just want her to leave me alone. I don't want to be her friend. I don't want her in my life. I don't want her to have control over me again."
TW! Most fucked up thing you’ve done because of bpd?,0,mlm2tx,1,"I realized I’m an absolutely horrible person and hurt everyone I loved during a depressive/psychotic episode. The guilt is so bad and I need to know if others with bpd have done terrible things during a bad episode.

My therapist of 2 years is leaving me...,2,mlh1bj,1,"Why do I feel so abandoned? She didn't even give an explanation why, though I suspect its because she doesn't think she can help me get any better. I feel so let down...I know I was just a patient, but she was the therapist I've been with the longest, out of the 12 I've seen in the past. It hurts so badly... I'm in bed crying now. And the worst part is I have to go about my day and pretend I'm fine, because none of my friends can ever handle my sadness, and they tend to just get annoyed when I feel bad."
Communication with partner about BD?,2,mlgmyn,0,"Hi yall! 

I’ve been with my SO for 2.5 years, and I was diagnosed with BPD a year and a half ago. The first year of our relationship, I recognise that I treated him poorly, and I’ve dedicated a lot of my time to building a healthier bond. Now I’m in DBT, and ive spent a lot of time working on our relationship- establishing boundaries for both of us, cutting back on my codependent actions, learning how to self validate (it hurts so much to be honest, I just want to call him and be with him 24/7 but anything to have a healthy relationship with the person who loves and supports me!) 

I love him very much. I understand I may be hyper-vigilant, but I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this- I’d like to send him some resources on how to support and talk to people with BPD. However, I’m afraid it will come off as “haha I’m using bpd as an excuse, here is a guide on how to deal with me like an animal”. There’s the part of me that’s afraid that he will see it as me trying to make an excuse for my behaviour. Honestly, it’s for his own good- I want him to have the resources to correctly communicate with me for the sake of the relationship, and the more he understands bpd, the more he’ll understand me. As we all know, BPD can’t just be easily turned off, or it wouldn’t be a disorder. I want him to have the resources to keep both of us happy and healthy. 

Maybe I’m over thinking it? I assume he would be receptive, but maybe before I have this discussion I’d want to know if any of you have had this talk before, and the best way to start it! Also if there are any suggestions for materials to send to SOs or loved ones, I’d appreciate it! 

Thank you!"
How to approach someone who you believe may have BPD,1,mllcza,3,"As the title says, how do you broach the topic with someone who you believe may have BPD? What do you do if they are reluctant to seek medical help to deal with this?

Can you have bpd without the anger/rage aspect?,0,mllay3,2,"My therapist wants to diagnose me and she's VERY certain I have bpd. Although I do not have the anger outbursts or the rage. I cry a lot.

But they are crying and sadness from a fight with a partner or rejection or feeling abandoned or lonely."
"Has anyone else ever been referred to as “cold,” “mean,” and/or “narcissistic?”",9,ml6riq,4,"Lately, I’m very nasty and mean. It’s like all the empathy I learned in therapy has dissipated, and I am back at square one. Ever since I stopped taking my lamictal, I’ve been exceptionally mean and unfeeling. It’s like there’s a hole in the spot where there’s supposed to be consideration and empathy. My bf thinks I’m very “cold,” “narcissistic” and “shallow” sometimes, and it’s bad because it’s like I lost the motivation to care. I have not been called narcissistic since high school, and I haven’t been this mean in a very long time. I cannot stand being this nasty to people, but again, there’s a lack of feeling to care, and idk why. Is it a self-hatred/ insecurity thing? Is it that my medication is drastically affecting my moods? why am i lacking motivation to care in the moment, and then when I hurt people, I feel remorse?"

17 yr old with bpd,1,mlk0v9,1,"
I am 17 years old and got my diagnosis. i’ve struggled so much since I was 7. A lot of things happened that made me realize so much at such a young age. Growing up I was always confused, still am. Confused on why I did what I did, why I felt the way I felt. Once I turned 15, things got so bad. Meaning I ruined so much for me. (was already ruining things for myself since I was 10). I won’t say exactly what happened but a lot did. After that, that’s when I got help and eh it helped a bit but the feeling never leaves. I was doing very good last year when I was 16. Very good. I felt happy. I didn’t feel guilt, anger, or had suicidal thoughts, at all. Something triggered it in October of last year. A lot did tbh. I got bad again I recently got out of my “manic episode” in march since then. It’s weird because I swear it feels as if I blacked out through it all, with just a very few memories ( not good ones) . I cry everyday after my manic episode ends for months. ( i’ve noticed this with my past episodes) i always end up feeling better after but then ruin it... it’s a cycle that has been consistent in my life for as long as i can remember. i just can’t believe I messed up so much for myself, why do i do that? I feel better now I guess. Just so sad that i didnt stop myself): I have friends and they are great. great. the opposite of me actually, i have some of the most stable friends ever. So as you can see I dont open up really, they wouldn’t get it.Which also leads me to feeling alone with how I feel. But what I want to know is will it ever get better? is it too late to mature? will this be me for the rest of my life? I’m almost an adult I shouldn’t be this impulsive and i hate it. I just want someone with bpd to tell me it has got better for them. i need to know i wont always self sabotage for the rest of my life.

but i’m also quite optimistic which makes no sense. I also know i could get my life together. It’s not that bad, i think the reason i feel so hopeless sometimes is because of how haunted i am by everything that happened to me and how confused i am. i just dont get why me. so much that is just wow . but I have money saved up, a car, and im graduating in june. ( impulsively quit my job in february, working on finding a new one ): ) but i just don’t want to keep having to go through the pain of it all if it will always result in me ruining stuff for myself it’s so painful among with the trauma I have. It sometimes feels that i can’t handle it for the rest of my life. i hate having memories and flashbacks of all the trauma i just want to be happy and not ruin it."
I always have to have less [intake] than whoever I’m eating with because of my eating disorder,2,mlexj4,0,"Sorry for eating disorder post, this community is more active than the ED one I posted in, & I know BPD crosses over with eating disorders a lot! 


For some reason, no matter what stage of “recovery” I’m in from my eating disorder - which was previously anorexia, now not underweight or engaging in as many behaviours, so probably OSFED - I (24nb) cannot seem to kick a few behaviours that are interfering with my day to day life. 

The most annoying one is that I simply *have* to have less calories than whoever is eating with me, & will not eat anything that isn’t “safe” unless there are other people there so I can can eat less than them, therefore deeming whatever I do eat as “safe” (less = safe). For example, if I make hot drinks I usually take mine with 1 sugar & a dash milk, my partner has 3-4 sugars & dash of milk. However, if someone else is around that also takes 1 sugar & milk, I make theirs with a heaped teaspoon of sugar, & mine with my regular, pedantically level teaspoon of sugar. *Sometimes* in the past, when had a housemate I didn’t like, I would put more milk & sugar in her tea/coffee with the spiteful thought *”she’s going to get fat”* or whatever.. yeah, I know. Crazy. 

It extends into everything I consume, which is very difficult because I am mainly in control of cooking meals in my household (just me & my boyfriend, sometimes my other boyfriend is round for dinner). If I wasn’t cooking for my partner, I would exclusively eat “safe”, disordered meals.. which sadly I do when he’s at work, or starve until he gets home. 

It’s this weird cycle of absolutely loving to cook & eat, but the disordered thoughts are always replacing my milk with soy, coconut milk & cheese with LIGHT products, serving myself up 1 spoon of rice & covering it in sauce to be sneaky, or freaking out that things are spoiled; I feel like a teenager hiding these silly behaviours. 

Some other, less concerning but equally annoying behaviours/intrusive thoughts I cannot seem to shake are: I cannot eat anything that has been out on the bench that has left my sight, due to an unimaginable fear that flies have laid eggs on it. I cannot consume food after I have seen maggots or flies because I convince myself they (maggots or fly eggs) are in my mouth. Or rather, I try to convince myself they’re not, that’s how strong the feeling is. This seems less eating disorder related & more like an intrusive thought, *but* I’m wondering if anyone else with an ED has these weird thoughts? Is it cuz I’m autistic & it’s food aversion? I don’t know. I have a lot of textural issues with food. 


I’m extremely reluctant to mention my eating disorder (of 10+ years) to my psychiatrist, as the only time I’ve mentioned it to a medical professional or even indicated it was when I was 15, when I was diagnosed but not treated because I did not tell my mother, & in the psych ward 3 months ago, where it was completely ignored, which made me spiral further into thinking my disorder isn’t valid because of my weight. 

Any insights or validation or resonance with these behaviours would be appreciated."
not always bpd's fault,278,mkkedo,42,"I've spent a long time blaming my bpd for my behavior and for my life being as shitty as I think it is. I've blamed it for the partners I've lost and the opportunities I've missed but I think I'm finally coming to the realization that it's not always BPD's fault. 

It's so nice to have a scapegoat like an already known and demonized mental illness, but I need to take responsibility for my actions. I have not always been a good person and for as long as I am human I will always make mistakes and question the validity of my goodness. BPD sucks, but it's an obstacle and I can't keep saying ""my BPD made me do this"" because no it didn't. I've told myself that narrative so many times that I stopped taking accountability for myself and stopped trying to change. That's unfair to me, unfair to the people I keep in my life, and unfair to other people with BPD. Going to a NT person with no experience in dealing with BPD and saying ""sorry lol my BPD made me do it"" will just harm them and create a bad image of what BPD is to them. 

It's not always BPD's fault because life is simply not sunshine and rainbows. There will always be some type of stressor around the corner that triggers me into an episode, that's something no one can control. And God I am so tired of the same routine of me having some sort of selfish emotional breakdown and then telling myself ""haha just BPD things! :)"".

Edit;; just wanted to add an edit cause I didn't expect anyone to read this haha! 
Thank you for the rewards and the nice comments I've read and also for other peoples insight

I wanted to clarify that when I posted this, I was speaking on how I would use my BPD to excuse my terrible behavior rather than acknowledge that my BPD might have been just a factor. I stopped apologizing for hurting people. I stopped critically thinking about why what I was doing was wrong. It was easier to use the excuse that I'm mentally ill than it was to keep constantly fighting a battle where I feel like it's me against myself and the world at large. When I say that it's not always BPD's fault, it's because it's not. I am responsible for the damage I do and I cannot blame my BPD for that when I am capable of growth and change. I am not a helpless victim to BPD because I can fight back against it by continuing to work on myself."
Replaced by FP,1,mljweg,1,"I don't know what to do right now. I know this isn't just in my head, I know it's real. I know I'm nothing to them now and they have someone better. 

I told them how I feel and it all went so wrong from there. It was all too late. I'm always too late. Not good enough. They already have someone who is so much better than me in every way.

My mind is spiraling now, I don't know what to do.
I know I shouldn't feel like this, I know I should just forget about them and move on but I can't."
I'm hated. And I'm probably actually gonna die alone.,2,mlel5i,0,"My brother molested me when I was 10.. 5 years later, I had no where to go when my mom...kicked me out over and over, i went there cause they were the only people who promised a break from my mom's constant downing I was 15...  My brother raped me for three months did I fight, no, was I on heavy amounts of Xanax .. yes.I slept through an entire police raid, if stay here, i will literally think about it for the next year, lile.why didn't I try to stop him.. idk..i always freeze or try to make My brain stop, that's a thing in my brain I ain't found yet, it's all really fuzzy  and the factor in most my guilt because I don't know.  But that was your way of telling me how badly u needed me gone... I know...I can't stop thinking about that now.  shot, sent to war, and raped  again and outcasted and I learned from that point,  I'm probably going to die. U ever wanted something so bad, life changing and one phone call.. took it from me,, I wish I couldve gone back and not called Casey,  he called the police.. everything changed for me.. the only shot i was ever given was taken because I didn't keep.it.to myself..I was 20. My life sucked.. And I saw the future..i.knew.... it's crazy the irony of my life, I've been married twice wasn't in love with anyone until I met my SO, is that selfish to think the person I feel for, musta felt the same? My existence was horrible before you and it has slowly gone back.to that feelingbefore I met u... I think it was the darkness inside u that.i  related, I was always hopeful we could turn it from black to gray. It was lightening up for a while and I was slapped in the face when he came out as bisexual and especially into transwomen, u don't need a man who pays to be a girl, if u have one.. I can order a dick of any size.. I don't get it. Why I couldn't be you're life, u never understood you were everything and more.. my last dollar.. my last cigg..idk. that guy who made me feel confident has now shown Me how I could never compete with your hottie... I cant..After 7 years of being together, traveling the country together.. tearing down and building up. We're a horrible couple but that's what made us strong.. our unacknowledged pain, and how hard we denied it but always forgave each other when it surfaced because we knew.. . I started losing my denial when u came out, I didn't understand it and I wished u never did. Stonewalling me, gaslighting me... like u didnt understand it took everything to put that effort in and I did it because I wanted u to be happy even at the cost of me, I'd be okay.. . chump change when I compare to when I hear u really laugh, when u smile withoutforce ... Boys Girls aliens, I've never truly desired anyone but you, my entire Ora brain reiwired when I knew I couldn't make u happy, that changed my life.. U were beating the living literally living shit out of me and I felt like you were taking my life, my body, and it was at anytime u could end that for me.. so I found a way to feel somewhat in control of MY BODY. you never have to think about me again.. but it WAS always my body and that was my solice in dark times. It made me come back to me, and it kept me going when I LET people do what I ALLOWED THEM to DO MY body. You were wrong when you realized u couldn't forgive me and u stayed. U were wrong for never allowing me to feel, or me to ask necessary questions that weren't meant to shame u but to understand. I lose the battle because I don't understand it. I can't find a reason how anyone falls that deeply out of love with me and in love with something so logically ugly, guess we were always attracted to broken unacknowledged pain.. I can't figure out why no matter how hard I tried I couldn't change us. I don't know why you couldn't understand what I did was out of a really a lost place... as yours is too. For the last two years... I just wanted u Back the most.. I needed you.. and you were gone. Idk. I was really trying to be normal to make up for what I did. I was. I died at your hands more then once..... isn't that a rebirth? Don't I get another shot at life? No. I wished it worked that way. I'm sorry I don't understand why we couldn't find each other in the dark places. I'm sorry. I really mean it.. every time I say it. But you are now unacknowledging your own pain, and mine. I truly can't go home.. I can't stay here.. I feel like a retarded burden who can't grasp unlogical situations. Even through the chaos everything made sense.. it hasn't since u told me I could never be your fantasy.. when you shared your fantasy.. I died. It was always my goal to make u happy through my black areas.. because u always did. We stopped. But then I saw you get lighter without me. I saw enough to know, I need to go. Why should I be miserable, make u miserable when one of us has a shot.. that's where I am. U won't find me for a while, thats if I can stop being a coward.. a baby.. a loser for more then 10 minutes. 

Maybe it's not fair, but your were my support.. I was yours until this..  I'm sorry I can't be stronger, I'm sorry.  I can't imagine a future. It's not black, it's just abyss. And I can't do it alone, I can't. I'm sorry dude. I never could translate, i.hope you can understand in this last weird brain memo, I'm sorry I hurt you, i.was trying to ease my pain. I'm sorry. I'll miss you guys.. not really, all feeling stops and Im excited about that. I haven't had a break. I need one. I love you both."
"After having a breakdown from missing my family (just called them, 3 times, everytime I ended the call I cried and called back), I immediately hit up an ‘option’ for a one-night-stand.",1,mljboj,0,"I have AvPD too so flings weren’t really on my radar until my 20th birthday (I am impulsive and competitive). However, since the pandemic, my family and I have been separated for the longest and furthest we have ever been. I just realised a pattern to my casual sex. I now avoid casual sex because the risk of getting an FP is 42% (I calculated) and also, covid. We’ve been trying to get together for the past year but our schedules don’t seem to line up and I chose to stay quarantined. 

I just want a friend tbh. I just want to hang out and do fun stuff. I have friends. But why do I use ONS and FWB’s for fulfilment. Tbh, I’m never actually satisfied, I just feel worse but I do it again and again anyways. I’m tired of the sex. But why are my only successful meet-ups for sex?"
Not going to confront,0,mlj8y1,0,"Well I found out someone was talking smack about me. 

I want to confront them. 

But wait - I barely know them and they live 3,000 miles away from me.

I’ve cut most of the people I know off,80,mksecv,36,"I finally deleted my accounts. I think it’s best that I don’t talk to people and become a ghost. I need to fix myself and my issues before I go back to talking to anyone again. It’s for the best for the people I know, it was becoming difficult to stay alone and not make it their problem constantly. I think the hardest part is to come, but i can’t live with basing my mood on one person, constantly worrying why they won’t talk to me or if they hate me. It unfair to them. I just want to learn to live with myself, and not need validation from anyone. Vent over./r/"
FP or enemy,0,mlj3zi,1,Hi! I'm undiagnosed but show a lot of signs of having bpd and I've noticed that after break ups the only way I can get over someone (who I actually like and care about) is by making them into the enemy somehow. Does anyone else do this?
EMDR success!,1,mlj2s4,0,"I recently found a great therapist and began seeing her. I was looking for someone who is in network with my insurance, taking new clients, and certified in EMDR. It took her a few weeks to call me back, but she did, and I knew as soon as we talked that she was a good fit. I did talk to two or three others on the phone too, but she was the best fit. 

She started with maybe 10 or 12 weekly sessions to take my history of traumatic events and do a sort of family tree. Then we were ready to begin EMDR. 

In the first session, I dealt with the death of my father at an early age (one of my first memories). It was so profound, I cried and cried. At the end, I felt it was cleared. I left with a deep sense of gratitude for all the people who helped me along the way in the time shortly after my dad died. The second session was a bust. I think she recognized it too and ended about 10 minutes early which was fine with me. I've only had two sessions, but have been so impressed with the first one that I an so encouraged. 

My therapist uses the bilateral buzzers with lights. I hold one in each hand. 

I've been at this therapy thing for a while. I've had CBT mostly. I've had lots of negative experiences, significant enough that I know they hold me back from achieving my potential, from having a fulfilling life. My functionality has improved over the years, but I still carry around these scars, emotional vulnerability and low self-esteem. 

For the first time in my life, I feel I have a chance to overcome. 

I wanted to share because I would not have known about EMDR if a friend had not told me about it. I have read a tiny bit about it on the internet and asked some mental health professionals before trying it. They all told me it helps significantly with trauma. I understand that BPD may have roots in childhood trauma, so I wanted to share here where I sometimes lurk in the hopes that it may help someone here. It gives me hope anyway.

Cheers to all of you!"
Is this normal?,2,mldh8u,2,I always feel like I'm going to die soon and it's an intense feeling that comes over me. Has an almost crippling effect and makes me get consumed in my head. End up not moving for like 10 minute periods just thinking and being stuck in my head.
Does it annoy anyone else when doctors ask if you're having suicidal thoughts?,15,ml2ghm,10,"*Yes, Lisa, every day. We go over this every time.* 

I know they're required to ask. I just hate being asked a yes/no question to which the answer is always yes. Just start asking me if I'm planning, for crying out loud."
i want to kill myself to make it the biggest “fuck u” to life & everyone that brings me pain,13,ml39qk,7,"having bpd people always think ur manipulative & youre always the bad guy. most people hate me online, i wish i could make everyone like me. i wish everyone could just forget i exist. it eats me from the inside knowing that people don’t want me to gain peace, they kick me when they see me down and when i’m rising then i’m at constant war with myself also."
Whats y'alls Myers Briggs Personality Types?,12,ml21yz,44,"I know anything 'Personaltiy' test, quiz, etc can be different for someone with a personality disorder but in all honesty, if you have ever take the Myers Briggs Personality Type test, what was your personality type?

Out of pure boredom, I have taken the test about 4 or 5 times(with periods of time in between each). Each time I got a different personality type and half of the ones i recoeved as my personality type i didnt feel really fit me that well.

Im curious."
How do you live with knowing you're a bad person?,19,mkza29,22,"I am not in danger to myself, but it's so hard to live with knowing you're a bad person. Knowing you've hurt people. There's a woman who didn't answer me for a while and I kept asking if she's mad, she insisted she isn't mad and then blocked me on everything. It's small things like that, but they happen all the time. I mean she said I wasn't bothering her and she wasn't mad, so I kept saying hi occasionally. And I am not blaming BPD, I just dunno where else to post this. And another time I accidentally stole a $3 box of cereal from the grocery store. I have messaged other people, a lot, because I thought they were mad.

I feel like a monster. Like if Dexter was real he'd take me out.

I have an internship coming up (photography) and the first woman often works with the person I am interning for. If I happen to meet her I won't say anything, but I feel like if I lose my coop because of this then..well, of course, it's my fault. No way around that.

I've been messaging everyone I've hurt and writing them an apology. Not a half-assed apology either. A good apology. I found a podcast on apologies and I used that to help me. I wrote one tonight and the person blocked me instantly. I hate that I used to make people uncomfortable.

It's so hard to live with all the pain I've caused so I developed new rules. 1) I cannot make friends. if I make friends, people will get mad at me. 2) I should stick to still life and product photography while I unfuck my brain. I love portraiture, but if I can't message people without asking if they're mad at me, then I shouldn't be messaging people.

I apologize that some parts here are vague."
Should I just quit my current job,4,ml7nct,3," 27. Been working since I'm 18. I get fired 50% of the time. Through the years I got diagnosed, there's a clear pattern of illness getting worse over time.

I'm having a rough moment in life. I've just been taking my med and forcing myself to sleep since last weekend (anti-depressant that makes you sleep, not recreational drugs). Lots of dreaming so it's not like I'm resting while sleeping. I've basically been bedridden since last friday and only recently I'm coming out of bed and my back hurts but that's another story.

I can't work like this, I haven't worked at all for the last two weeks. I just pretend I'm working. Job is definitely taking me to the edge, superiors have started making demands and scolding me because of my fault.

This has been my fault, I've stopped seeing my doctor for a while, now he doesn't want me as a patient. I've tried to force myself to be employed through this hell and I only keep a job for some weeks only to get fired. I actually wish I was in the psych ward right now. Last week I was going to start crying and my mother just told me to fuck off and cry somewhere else. I'm back to living with parents and I can't expect support from them, they're doctors, they shouldn't have to put up with this, I recognize that.

Right now I just wish I had nothing to worry about. I don't even care about financial ruin.

I don't even know how to quit, I have lots of pending very important reports."
DAE: Obsessed with celebrity crush?,2,mlb8me,10,"I mean, it’s so exhausting and not funny anymore. It’s out of control. I can’t stop watching his videos, podcasts, photos, stalking him. He has kids and wife and I feel so jealous. This is the person I don’t even know!!! I dont even know this man, but i got so depressed to the point of crying! He might be a jerk irl. But I can’t help it.."
Any married people on here randomly want to get a divorce?,0,mlg5ff,1,"I can't help but wonder if my husband and kids would be better off without me. My mental illness is so draining on me I can't imagine what it's like for them. Idk where else to go.

I just randomly get urges to divorce my husband and leave so he could go be happy with someone normal. 

Anyone else?"
I use compassion to regulate my emotions.,78,mkp0un,19,"I realized that the only thing that calms me down when I'm angry is compassion. I need someone to tell me that they understand what I'm going through. That's why I overshare, I just want someone to understand my pain. That's why therapy always frustrates me, I want my therapist to tell me that my pain is valid, not that I have to take responsibility for it, because that doesn't bring me relief. And I'm so tired of not having any other way to regulate my emotions, it's really frustrating, I just want to be able to calm down like a normal person."
Sleeping it out,11,ml1854,3,"My boyfriend(non BPD) is a big believe in if we are arguing or disagreeing at night, to just go to sleep and see how we feel in the morning. The idea of this feels horrific to me (BPD)! He always says things are better in the morning. After forever of us fighting (basically me just having an episode) he kept trying to get me to lay down to sleep. I fought it and fought it because that's how my brain works but I eventually fell asleep. And HE WAS RIGHT! We were able to turn around, love on each other and talk. 
Is anyone able to do this? And did it work for you?
I don't have the confidence to say that I can do this often because my mind just doesn't ease. But I would like to be about to get to that point."
Being trans with BPD is wild.,20,mkxy58,4,"Being on hormone replacement therapy, essentially going through puberty again in my mid-20’s, is challenging in and of itself. That alone could give me a lot of the mood swings and such that look like BPD.

Thing is, I’ve had BPD since loooong before then. So this is nothing new. It’s just that little bit extra now. Instead of just savagely beating up on myself for the people I’ve hurt and my directionless life, now it’s all that *plus* my mind screaming internalized hate at me. “You’re not real, you’re just manipulating people into going along with your charade, you don’t deserve this after the pain you’ve caused others, give up and be miserable.”

Therapy, as well as some pretty heavy anti-anxiety/anti-depressants, have been helping, but still. I already have had a hard enough time accepting myself for the 20+ years I hid in the closet, having BPD’s challenges on top of it makes it all feel extremely heavy."
I'm struggling,1,mlede7,0,"hello!! im not sure if this is allowed so pls admins take this down if it isn't but i'm seriously desperate and didn't know who else to turn to

Im really unwell at the moment (I have a chronic illness + mental health issues) and am struggling to scrape money together for food and bills, and my therapist just hit me w a $180 bill (hopefully I will get some back on medicare) but i was wondering if anyone could even spare $1 that would help me so much so I can eat this week and pay my electricity just until i can get back on my feet and if you can't then pls dont but i didn't know what else to do!! I would be seriously so grateful and once im financially okay again and able to I would donate the amount I received to a charity (either LGBT+ youth related or BPD related) so that it would be paid forward !!

Diagnosed but I don’t feel borderline,0,mldhyk,4,"I got diagnosed with BPD when I was 18 (I’m 21 now) and I’ve began to think it was done too rashly by a doctor I only saw a couple of times.

I often read posts here and I find it hard to relate. I don’t fear abandonment, in fact I get over things faster than the average person so abandonment would be no issue to me and in relationships it’s usually the other person who clings to me and I’ve been called uncaring even when I’m not. 

My emotions are rather fleeting, sometimes I feel like I never felt at all because everything is just whatever to me although I’m still an enthusiastic person (if you get it).

My self-esteem is good, I don’t care what people think about me but I do have unstable relationships because I have a tendency to act out and I get angry easily.

 I can’t handle boredom and basically I do stupid stuff all the time (hard drugs, pick fights, shoplift, etc) and i’m super impulsive, it’s really hard for me to resist temptation so I also cheat easily and I find it fun to play with people’s feelings (I suspect it’s because drama kills the feelings of boredom that I dread).

I don’t self harm although I used to when I was younger, don’t feel suicidal, don’t dissociate although I’ve had a psychotic episode or two. 

My opinions change fast and I might suddenly dislike someone for no reason and people have called me unstable, I feel like people take life too seriously and that’s why I just do whatever just because. 

But why was I diagnosed with BPD? Could it be a misdiagnosis? I find it really hard to relate to this sub especially with people who are clingy and say they feel too much

Edit: My life is in a constant state of chaos as I’m in trouble with the law often, can’t hold onto jobs and have a ton of debt so maybe that plays into it?"
People say they care but they don’t,0,mldf7k,2,My friends say they worry about my mental health but don’t leave me alone and ask me what’s wrong when it’s convenient for them and when i say i don’t wanna talk about it or i just need some space for a while they won’t leave me alone until i tell them which makes me angry. they invite me out but when i go they straight up ignore me which makes me feel stupid and i regret ever leaving my house ever. i feel like crying when i’m surrounded by people who say they care but ignore me when they want to. i don’t understand this. why?
Things our parents should have taught us,4,ml60l5,1,"Being that almost all of us probably suffered abandonment abuse and neglect from our parents, what are things you never got to learn from your parents that might help others?

For me the biggest is they refused to teach me to drive or help in anyway. I'm 24 and finally about to get a license

My mother has refused repeatedly to give me tax information so I could get fafsa and go to college, but I'm finally old enough to do it without her.

Other things like my dad being gone hand never taught me to shave, tie a tie, talk to girls, etc.

My parents being separated I never learned about proper relationships and love.

 being abused and neglected I never learned to trust people and never learned the whole worlds not trying to hurt me and use me.

They let me drop out of highschool and didnt do anything after multiple suicide attempts as a teenager and my step father used to beat the shit out of me and kick me out for weeks at a time. I had no self value and self worth and no way so young to get help on my own.

I dont know. Theres so much that normal parents do that many of ours didnt and I really would like to know what lessons and things you guys learned later on that you should have learned in loving family.
I love you r/bpd family🖤"
How do I cope with this?,1,mld0me,5,"He cut me out....AGAIN. My ex and I chose to be friends after some time apart. Things were ok at first, then I started to get upset because his words and actions never matched up. We'd get in arguments because of how he was treating me, and his lying, it caused me to have some mental breakdowns. I started to have major issues trusting what came out of his mouth and needed constant reassurance. The first two times he cut me out, I became suicidal as he's been a huge part of my life for years. Despite how he's treated me, I always miss him like crazy and want him in my life. I feel a sense of relief when he comes back. 
He took me out for my birthday brunch 5 days ago. He wrote me the most beautiful birthday card apologizing for how he's treated me...that I deserve better, how he's going to be a better friend to me, how I have such a good heart...Well then during brunch, I found out he lied again and lost it...started crying at the table and having a panic attack. We went back to my house and it continued. When he was about to leave, I became clingy and begged him to stay. I was scared he was going to leave me, cut me out again. He reassured me that was not going to happen, then he left. I even asked if he was just saying that so he could leave, and he said no. For reassurance, I gave him my spare house keys, to promise me he wouldn't cut me out.

Well I've tried to contact him a few times and no response. I've been completely ignored, and he's been active on social media. I haven't been suicidal yet, but I'm in so much pain and dealing with severe anxiety..the ruminating won't stop. I've completely lost my appetite and already lost a few lbs, I can't sleep and wake up with panic attacks at night. I've called the crisis hotline for support numerous times. This has broken me. I just want to hear from him, for everything to be okay. I don't know how to get through this...how do I stop this pain? This is severely and negatively affecting my life."
paranoia over relationships,3,ml70vq,1,"and this guy online living like soooo many miles away is talking to me??? and for over a year now? i don’t know how that happens because i’ve never talked to someone for so long. undoubtedly, it is on and off, but in the end it’s still there. i don’t know why it happens. it’s so embarrassing. i hate it. i don’t trust them. i’m so paranoid over it. why is he doing this? what does he want from me? what the fuck. i hate him. what the hell is he thinking. oh my god. like just stay away from me. give up. are you seriously gonna play with me like that?? i’m not a toy. i don’t trust them. but that’s just my paranoia right? i can’t tell if this is intuition or paranoia. i can’t tell!! all rationality goes out the window when it comes to relationships w ppl i have romantic feelings towards?? 

everytime they give me attention i feel like a giddy schoolgirl fangirling over a celebrity!! and then i hate them afterwards. i just don’t trust them. i can’t trust anybody like that. i’ll never. i can’t let myself. i hate them but i want them 

it’s so embarrassing talking about them and coming up with all these scenarios in my head and trying to figure how to go about them. trying to avoid thinking about them. trying to avoid talking to them. trying to distance myself away from them. then it comes crashing down the second they message me and then again the cycle repeats itself afterwards. i don’t trust them. im saying all this and it just confirms that i’m obsessing when i don’t want to be. it’s embarrassing and humiliating. it makes me feel weak and powerless."
I don't fit anywhere,7,ml3api,6,"DAE fall into the category of not doing very well but not absolutely awful either? I'm literally on the border constantly, i do have to say it's a different story when I'm seeing someone romantically, i have no relationship or friends because those things caused me a lot of damage up until two years ago & i just couldn't handle having either. 

I've never been one to self harm apart from hitting myself and hair pulling.. I've never been one for drugs but have smoked marijuana every day for the last 7 years, it makes things softer. 
All my relationships have failed miserably. 
My family life is beyond fucked.

So many of you have a harder time than me, why do i feel guilty all the time for thinking about dying? Sorry I'm just in the mood to rant, i rarely talk about how i feel and I'm certainly not going to tell someone i know about this."
Brain on fire?,14,mky21i,1,Does anyone else feeling like they are on fire constantly and just want to jump out of their skin?

Not because of body image issues or anything but just the fact that I am very uncomfortable just being alive.
I always have to have less [intake] than whoever I’m eating with because of my eating disorder,0,mlc4sx,0,"So I’ve cross-posted this in an eating disorder specific sub, but figure eating disorders cross over with BPD a lot & I thought I might post here too... 

For some reason, no matter what stage of “recovery” I’m in from my eating disorder - which was previously anorexia, now not underweight or engaging in as many behaviours, so probably OSFED - I (24nb) cannot seem to kick a few behaviours that are interfering with my day to day life. 

The most annoying one is that I simply *have* to have less calories than whoever is eating with me, & will not eat anything that isn’t “safe” unless there are other people there so I can can eat less than them, therefore deeming whatever I do eat as “safe” (less = safe). For example, if I make hot drinks I usually take mine with 1 sugar & a dash milk, my partner has 3-4 sugars & dash of milk. However, if someone else is around that also takes 1 sugar & milk, I make theirs with a heaped teaspoon of sugar, & mine with my regular, pedantically level teaspoon of sugar. *Sometimes* in the past, when had a housemate I didn’t like, I would put more milk & sugar in her tea/coffee with the spiteful thought *”she’s going to get fat”* or whatever.. yeah, I know. Crazy. 

It extends into everything I consume, which is very difficult because I am mainly in control of cooking meals in my household (just me & my boyfriend, sometimes my other boyfriend is round for dinner). If I wasn’t cooking for my partner, I would exclusively eat “safe”, disordered meals.. which sadly I do when he’s at work, or starve until he gets home. 

It’s this weird cycle of absolutely loving to cook & eat, but the disordered thoughts are always replacing my milk with soy, coconut milk & cheese with LIGHT products, serving myself up 1 spoon of rice & covering it in sauce to be sneaky, or freaking out that things are spoiled; I feel like a teenager hiding these silly behaviours. 

Some other, less concerning but equally annoying behaviours/intrusive thoughts I cannot seem to shake are: I cannot eat anything that has been out on the bench that has left my sight, due to an unimaginable fear that flies have laid eggs on it. I cannot consume food after I have seen maggots or flies because I convince myself they (maggots or fly eggs) are in my mouth. Or rather, I try to convince myself they’re not, that’s how strong the feeling is. This seems less eating disorder related & more like an intrusive thought, *but* I’m wondering if anyone else with an ED has these weird thoughts? Is it cuz I’m autistic & it’s food aversion? I don’t know. I have a lot of textural issues with food. 


I’m extremely reluctant to mention my eating disorder (of 10+ years) to my psychiatrist, as the only time I’ve mentioned it to a medical professional or even indicated it was when I was 15, when I was diagnosed but not treated because I did not tell my mother, & in the psych ward 3 months ago, where it was completely ignored, which made me spiral further into thinking my disorder isn’t valid because of my weight. 

Any insights or validation or resonance with these behaviours would be appreciated."
I can't take Twitter anymore,7,ml19k3,12,"I wasn't sure to make or not this post but I'm bursting with bad emotions. 
Twitter triggers every and all negative feelings on me. I can't do it anymore. I did an account solely for following some cc's I like. 
Everyday and everytime I saw stupid people and unfair discussions. It makes so angry. So absolutely mad, it physically drains me.
 I'm holding back tears right now, it exhausts me so much. I just deleted my account, I don't plan to go back. I feel so sad for all the people being targeted, all the injustice, lack of love, lack of respect. 
How can people be able to treat others with so little compassion? I don't get it, I hate it. And I hate how it affects me so much. Today was the last straw.
I hope one day people learn how to be actually good people and not just plain rude and mean."
How I felt last night vs this morning are POLAR OPPOSITES,12,mkz9sj,2,"Last night I finally faced the emotions I’ve been pushing aside all week. I cried until I couldn’t breathe. 

I somehow convinced myself that the right thing to do was to message my FP, who essentially decided we should just be acquaintances 3 weeks ago because we were hurting each other. Last night, I was convinced I should tell him I was in love with him. That I’m sorry for hurting him and that I would be blocking him because I love him too much to keep myself from speaking to him or waiting for him to speak to me. I really, 100% felt convinced that that was what I needed to do for closure. The thought felt so liberating and RIGHT. 

However, I didn’t do it. But not because of any conscious change in my outlook. I exhausted myself crying and fell asleep once I was done.

This morning I woke up feeling mildly sick at the mere thought of what I would have done. NO part of me feels like that was a good idea anymore. I would have felt so ashamed after opening myself up to and forcing my emotions onto someone who clearly rejected me and wants nothing to do with me, and who was hurt by my actions. 

The problem I’m having is how much it scares me that I can have such POLAR OPPOSITE THOUGHTS in such a short period of time. I can’t trust myself to believe in anything I feel. I can’t trust myself to do what’s best. I can’t trust myself to believe in me or make the right choices for me. I have no real compass. I don’t know who I am anymore. With every fiber of my being I’d felt like messaging him was the right choice last night. Not to try to get him back, but just to be honest and open. And the me this morning is disgusted by the possibility... who the hell am I?"

First Episode after receiving diagnosis,4,ml4opn,1,"CW/ sh and substance use

Hi, I’m new here and just got diagnosed with BPD not very long ago. I’ve had a very difficult time coping with this diagnosis, as I have been misdiagnosed constantly by mental health professionals since freshman year of HS (I’m a college sophomore now). Friday night, I had one of the worst episodes of my life. Triggered by rejection by a guy I had been talking to, I immediatley spiraled. I have been s*lf h*rm*ng since sophomore year of highschool, and in January relapsed and have been struggling since. I went to my room alone and started s*lf h*rm*ng and called my mom and just screamed at her about how badly she fucked me up. My mom has never taken my mental health seriously and growing up, made me feel ashamed constantly. 

Normally when I’ve had episodes in the past (not knowing that’s what it was since I was undiagnosed at the time) I would word vomit out of anger/hopelessness. But Friday it was on another level. I had been drinking a lot (which I’m starting to realize I do when I’m having an episode) and cussed out my mother and told her about my drinking, smoking weed, being an atheist etc. (My parents are very conservative and my mothers dad was an alcoholic). The next day I was so ashamed when I woke up I couldn’t even function. Is it a common thing to say these types of things during an episode? Does anyone else feel so disgusted with themselves for outbursting like this?

I planned on ignoring my mother until she reached out to me, but last night I called her with the intention of explaining why BPD caused me to have this reaction, but she invalidated my diagnosis and called me an attention seeker. How do you deal with loved ones rejecting your BPD? I feel so alone, and then her saying that makes me doubt myself and that I am an attention seeker, even though I know that’s not the truth:( help"
My empirical speculations,7,ml13oj,4,"This post is a work in progress.

I think my BPD boils down to:

* High sensory processing
* Childhood neglect and insecure attachment
* Issues with the hippocampus – which helps regulate behavior and self-control
* Severe executive-dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex (which is involved in planning and decision making) and overactive amygdala which is normally regulated by the PFC and plays an important role in regulating emotions, especially the more ""negative"" emotions, such as fear, aggression and anxiety

I don't see how it could be anything else but these. Every other issue ties back to them. I suspect these are core to many cases, with the last one being seriously underestimated.

I'm thinking about Robert Sapolsky, his work on Free Will and book called '[Behave](https://fourminutebooks.com/behave-summary/)' in relation to all this. Also the book Good Reasons for Bad Feelings. I'm interested in the physical, biological aspects and the implications for personal responsibility.

[Another 'Behave' summary](https://growth.me/books/behave/#1-the-triune-brain-model-your-brain-is-part-reptilian-part-emotional-and-part-neocortex)

The trouble is, because it expresses as behaviours and not things like tremors in Parkinson's or forgetting in Alzheimer's, people find it hard to acknowledge or consider.

From Wikipedia:

>**Brain Abnormalities**  
>  
>A number of neuroimaging studies in BPD have reported findings of reductions in regions of the brain involved in the regulation of stress responses and emotion, affecting the hippocampus, the orbitofrontal cortex, and the amygdala, amongst other areas. A smaller number of studies have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy to explore changes in the concentrations of neurometabolites in certain brain regions of BPD patients, looking specifically at neurometabolites such as N-acetylaspartate, creatine, glutamate-related compounds, and choline-containing compounds.  
>  
>Some studies have identified increased gray matter in areas such as the bilateral supplementary motor area, dentate gyrus, and bilateral precuneus, which extends to the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The hippocampus tends to be smaller in people with BPD, as it is in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, in BPD, unlike PTSD, the amygdala also tends to be smaller. This unusually strong activity may explain the unusual strength and longevity of fear, sadness, anger, and shame experienced by people with BPD, as well as their heightened sensitivity to displays of these emotions in others. Given its role in regulating emotional arousal, the relative inactivity of the prefrontal cortex might explain the difficulties people with BPD experience in regulating their emotions and responses to stress.  
>  
>**Executive Function**  
>  
>While high rejection sensitivity is associated with stronger symptoms of borderline personality disorder, executive function appears to mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms. That is, a group of cognitive processes that include planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving might be the mechanism through which rejection sensitivity impacts BPD symptoms. A 2008 study found that the relationship between a person's rejection sensitivity and BPD symptoms was stronger when executive function was lower and that the relationship was weaker when executive function was higher. This suggests that high executive function might help protect people with high rejection sensitivity against symptoms of BPD. A 2012 study found that problems in working memory might contribute to greater impulsivity in people with BPD."
I feel like i’m not allowed to speak to my friends + family,1,mlae27,0,"DAE realise how stupid and unnecessary it is to not want to speak to your friends + family but you feel like you have to keep shut. i feel like if i speak to them i’m giving them more privilege than i should (because they hate me, they’re plotting against me, why should i talk to them? it would be kicking myself in the foot)"
I feel like a fucking parasite.,91,mkifpb,8,"I’ve just started becoming close with someone new, I literally can’t stop thinking about them. I crave their attention, every little piece of it I get just feeds my illusion of what we will be in the future.

All my time and effort is being put into this new person, I can’t remember to do anything because there’s only one thing I’m focused on. I mean, a million things I’m focused on, but just around that one person. I just can’t believe how much we have in common, we are basically the same person. 

Oh right, I know they like that so my brain has chosen to focus on that so they like me more. Suddenly I have all these reasons of my I’m messaging them, hey they didn’t reply, don’t message them...okay I’ve messaged them again. But “hahaha I’m sorry if I’m annoying you!” No, I’m not annoying them, they like the attention.

"Has anyone else done deplorable things merely for the approval of others? I am riddled with guilt because of my past, and I do not deserve to live.",1,ml9f50,4,"In my adolescence, when untreated and undiagnosed, I routinely did bad things for the appraisal of my friends and bullies. Such things stretch across a spectrum from minor incidents to irredeemable, criminalising incidents. I have hurt a great many people, and I cannot excuse my behaviour.

I got my heart broken and it’s all my fault,8,mkz6wm,6,"There’s this guy who I started hooking up with a couple months ago. I thought I could do a strictly FWB type relationship, but I ended up getting emotionally invested(who would’ve thought) 
These feelings were unrequited, of course, but I felt like I could live with it, since he still wanted to fuck. Plus, I know that I’m in no place to start a relationship, so I thought this hookup would be liberating. Regardless, my heart had other plans, and my heart chose him. 
A couple days ago, he tells me there’s another girl he wants to get serious with, ultimately ending whatever sexual relations we had. It felt like this man had ripped my heart out of my chest. Yes, I saw heartbreak coming from a mile away and yes, I knew that this type of relationship is not something I’m good at handling. I went on with it anyways, and now I’m here, feeling like absolute shit. 
I’m going through a really fucking rough time right now, and he promised me he still cares about me and we’d still be friends. He says I can come to him anytime for anything, whenever I need him. He even came to my house to check up on me and talk, because he knows how much this shift in our relationship affected me, on top of everything else I’m dealing with. 
At first, trying to get over it was hard. I turned to self harm, weed, and alcohol to help me cope. I convinced myself that if I couldnt have him in that way, why have him in my life at all. I got rid of all contact with him, and decided to move on with my life. About a day later, I realized that he’s a good person and a valuable friend to have. After a day without talking, I finally replied to him and we actually had a great conversation. That night, I went to a party for my friends birthday, hung out with other guys, and thought I’d be fine just being friends. All was well. 
Until just a couple moments ago. I checked his story, and it’s a photo of the aforementioned other woman. They’re on a sushi date. Seeing that actually physically affected me. My chest fucking hurts as if someone just punched me right in the heart. I felt like screaming, sobbing, punching my wall, etc. I felt like I was gonna pass out. 
This all fucking sucks because I was actually having a good day today, then this fiasco completely flipped my mood. Now it feels as if I’m back in the dark hole I just finished clawing my way out of. I start to feel dizzy just thinking about that fucking picture.
I feel pathetic, desperate, worthless and fucking stupid. This shit makes me hate myself. I feel like an absolute loser. I’m convinced I’ll never find someone who loves me as much as I love them. Im convinced there will always be someone better, and I’m just a temporary placeholder for those who are on the way to finding someone much more fitting for them."

I have no friends, the ones I had left me or we fell apart for one reason or another, no support system since my family doesn't give a fuck, I'm pursuing a worthless degree and already worrying about how I'm going to feed myself, right as I thought I was doing better mentally I fall into a hole again.

I can't afford therapy either, and I don't believe anyone can in my country unless they're super rich, so there's no chance of DBT for me either. What do I do? What the fuck is the point?

bff of 5 years blocks me and refuses to speak to me,3,ml3yid,0,"TW: suicidal thoughts, friendship conflicts, swearing, abandonment 

my best friend (L) (20f) and i (21f) got into a really bad fight almost two months ago. i need to objectively know if i am being exhausting. we got into a heated argument all because of a scheduling conflict. she accused me of replacing her with another close friend of mine (K), which could not be further from the truth. both of these friends are of equal importance to me. it was my birthday and K and i were supposed to go out for drinks but we had to reschedule due to bad weather. unfortunately, we had to reschedule for the following day, when i was supposed to see my best friend. the plans with L were never set in stone, and we never had a time set. however, L initially was not bothered by the possibility of rescheduling and was actually excited because we planned on bringing another mutual friend (B) with us that upcoming weekend. B was coming from out of state. i thought this would be a great idea so that L, B, and i could go all go out to eat together and catch up! a few days pass, and L completely switches up on me. during these few days she was still sending me memes and shit like normal. the day before we have plans to go she starts accusing me of shit like, “you’re replacing me with K because she lives closer,” “you’re throwing me away for someone you’ve only known for a few months” (K and i were coworkers for a long time), “you only see me when it’s convenient for you” (i offered to drive out to her not that long ago but her boyfriend said he didn’t want any company at the last minute), and she just kept making me feel awful and brought me to tears. my mom heard me on the phone with L and wanted to know what was going on. she says, “L stop treating (me) like shit. She’s sitting here crying” and L says, “well it didn’t sound like she was crying. you’re invalidating MY feelings.” we were so shocked tbh. honestly, i could go on and on but that’s the gist of it. shit just kept getting worse. ultimately, she ended up blocking me, which she knows is a HUGE trigger for me. i apologized a million times, my mom tried to talk to her, my boyfriend tried to talk to her, everything. she won’t speak to me. she absolutely hates me and says i invalidated her feelings. she sent one of her friends after me, and her friend just annihilated me about how i’m such a shitty person to do this to L. tbh, i don’t even know what i’m apologizing for, but i feel like i did SOMETHING wrong. i have tried calling her and texting her multiple times but nothing. i am absolutely devastated and questioning everything, especially since we have  had a tumultuous past with arguing. however, it’s never been this bad. she always gets mad at me, and i don’t know what i’m doing wrong. i’m sorry if this made actually no sense, but i’m really having a hard time. i feel like i’m an awful person, and i just feel so sorry for everything. i wish i could redo everything. even if you just took the time to read this, thank you."

I suffer from BPD, and he’s been the person I’ve been co-dependent on throughout our relationship. He suffers with depression/anxiety and possible other mental health issues.

We moved into his hometown together in May of last year and got our first apartment in July. I have been the one paying the bills and rent this entire time since then. I’ve been unemployed up until a month ago, barely keeping everything afloat by driving for delivery services. my mental health problems have worsened significantly and i’ve been going through the worst episode i’ve ever had since then. he has not been working or doing anything to progress with his life, he tells me that it is his mental health in the way. he has not gotten the help he needs despite telling me he will. he tells me that he doesn’t want to be this way and that he doesn’t want to keep hurting me and watching me struggle but he can’t seem to muster up the courage to go get help. i’ve been patient for so long and giving everything i can to show him that i support him, mothering everything he does even. i’m so unhappy. he tells me that he loves me so much and i believe him but i also believe that he’s codependent on me as well.

I feel like i’m in an eternal struggle right now. I feel so much resentment towards him and I’m not sure if i’m even attracted to him anymore, but I also feel like I need him.

She would even tell every guy she hung out with that she was being spied on, and would then call me freaking out absolutely convinced that they were doing it too and downloaded some spy program her ex supposedly used since she told them about it. I kind of asked.. well if your so afraid of it happening again then why tell anyone at all? She didn't have much of an answer. She really had this paranoia of being spied on or that people wanted her so badly that they were going to these great lengths. Just overall she seemed like she was going through some major crisis that, as I got to know her seemed to be exaggerations or just plain bs. She called me daily to talk about herself and her life.. I was really going through a rough time when we were friends. Despite that I really made a solid effort to help and be a patient understanding friend and it just really felt super unreciprocated. she just seemed to think the world revolved around her. And when I was doing really poorly with my depression and drug use, dealing with my fathers sudden death. it seemed like she was angry and impatient I wasn't there to play armchair therapist for her. Seemed like she only wanted me to feel better so she could use me as an emotional dumping ground, and that the relationship wasn't really as meaningful for her as it was for me, I felt used. I was leaving for a work trip early in the morning once and hadn't packed yet. But since she had something important to do I agreed to watch her daughter free of charge to show i'm a good friend. When she gets back she hangs out for a few hours and then wouldn't even give me a ride home, I acted like it was cool and I got she was tired but I was shocked and disappointed.

Ex messaged me today to hookup after 3 months and I am proud of myself!,548,mk6qf5,63,"So we hadn’t talked for three months, I messaged him March 19th to see what was up (he promised me that we would talk as time passed and I held onto that so I wanted to see if he’d keep his promise. At this point I didn’t really care at all about actually talking to him). He ignored that message completely. 

Today, Easter, he messaged me saying “hey, I know it’s been a minute, but do you wanna hookup? Strictly that.” Back in December he asked the same thing and manipulated me into giving consent. 

And now, friends, I am proud today to say that I did not reply to his message at all. I deleted it and continued rather than giving him a piece of my mind and say everything I’ve wanted to say for 3 months I realized that would do nothing and he hasn’t learned at all from his behavior so it’s pointless. He just embarrassed himself. He looks like a joke. And now I feel like I’m the one who has control.

I have a good handle on riding through impulses and staying functional, but oh my god, every single month the two days before my period I get as bad as I get. The worst of the WORST of my suicidal thoughts, going in and out from extreme emotional distress to complete numbness, and the most distorted sense of self. It’s equally devastating each time it happens and it always seems to completely come out of the blue despite me knowing it will happen. Does anyone else who menstruates experience anything similar?"
What am I doing??,27,mkmk76,3,"Does anyone else ever have the feeling that they’re about to colossally fuck things up, but you just keep on going?? About to burn everything to the fucking ground in my life, but it’s like I can’t stop it. These fucking emotions fucking with my head. I know how this attachment shit works by now, but fuck it always happens when I least fucking expect it. Fuck me. I know how unhealthy my attachment issues are but I don’t know how the fuck to fix this shit. I’ve tried to locate DBT help for years. No one in my area offers it and if you have issues other than depression and anxiety, it’s pointless to go because they are zero damn help. Feel so damn lost and like this bullshit will never get better. I’m in my 40’s for fuck‘s sake. I know it’s all my fault. I hate my fucking self and all my bullshit."
Wanting to communicate but too scared.,6,mkw0v8,0,"Does anyone struggle with wanting to communicate to close friends about feeing left out or ignored, but scared to look needy and selfish for saying so? It would explain my coldness and standoffish behavior lately.

Idk what to do anymore. I’ve tried snapping out of it. Being objective.

These thoughts and feelings are killing me. I just want them to stop and be a normal person."
Hyper perfection with grades,6,mkwy3e,2,"If I do not get an A I will cry and hurt myself
I need to pass and do my best
My grades hold so much worth and value and I’m wondering if anyone else does this
I saw on a bpd tik tok that some people do this and I’m wondering if y’all would know why or do this too"
Feel like a monster,8,mktyrp,4,I thought my most recent ex was a narcissistic asshole who didn’t care about me and treated me like shit. I’m starting to think it was the other way around and I feel like utter crap. I feel like a monster. I wonder how often I blindly crush people. How can I ever change when I don’t even recognize what I’m doing in the moment and I am CONVINCED it’s the other person?
Feeling emptier than usual. Looking for someone to relate.,3,ml10pg,6,"I have always struggled with self identify. It’s like I never see myself as being “normal” like everyone else. 

I lost my bf/best friend about 7 months ago. He couldn’t take all the bpd symptoms anymore. I want to blame him but I understand how much I put him through. 

I can’t be myself around anyone else. When I was with him I felt whole. What’s worse is that we were friends for 12 years before dating. Now that he’s gone I’ve lost all that history and comfort too. 

I’ve been suicidal before, but never successful. I just wish I could contact him somehow but he’s erased himself completely from the planet basically. I’m not sure if he’d even know if I was gone and I feel mostly gone already."
Life choices,1,ml6ks0,1,"Waking up 4 in the morning from drinking all day... I didn't have a hangover but like fuck what a mess... anyways cleaned that up now I'm here writing away..

You ever just get the feeling you have no idea what you're doing?. Like your life is just running it's course and while you try to grasp any concept of what reality is, your brain just implodes on itself and your stuck back at square 1?. I have this feeling constant and it never goes away. Sure I use meds and what not to clear my head but then boom I do dumb shit like drink for 3 days in a row. Like why do I do that when I tell myself every day ""don't be an idiot, don't be an idiot""?. I'm in school, always wanted to go to school, and now I'm in school and I'm like ""fuck this"". Like why?. What the fuck is wrong with me dude?."
"I am me, myself and I - and nothing else",6,mkwdmp,2,"First of all: I am doing fine. Not like everything is all flowers, rainbows and all is perfect, but I am doing well. No self-harm for over a year, my eating disorder's practically nonexistent now, my last therapy (after several therapies and a total of about 7-8 years in therapy) ended with my therapist calling me ""officially cured"" (do not fit the clinical criteria anymore), no suicidal ideation (sometimes thoughts, but fleeting, not permanent + I do know, I want to live) and a few months ago I ended a toxic relationship thinking: I am worth more than being someone else's punching bag. Great progress all in all even though I do feel down whenever I feel myself relapsing into old bad behaviour (towards myself or others). Still, I think everything's rather normal with small outbursts of ""unusually emotional stuff"" when it comes to bad memories and triggers. So there I am and I want to kind of get something out of my system here as I feel like this really did help me: I lost the label. I stopped more or less identifying myself with BPD.

Quite frankly, I've been through several long therapies and therapists always were uncomfortable with telling me their diagnosis. Sometime they usually did, but all of them were different anyhow. As someone who was doing relatively well in life, most didn't see a real problem with me and I on the other hand had that constant feeling of having to ""prove"" my pain to them. This ended up with me someday shedding all those labels. I was sick of them and annoyed to high heaven with how a lot of people thought they knew me based on what I was diagnosed with or others who thought they could constantly make things my fault, because that's what pwBPD do, don't they? Fuck things up with people, because they have this need to do this.

This constant denial of my own reality made me stay in abusive friendships and later on also relationships for way too long. And as one therapist thought it'd be good for me to meet other people with similar struggles (so other people with BPD), I tried an online support group. That's when I truly realized how crippling that label was (any psychological label in general actually). It was always ""BPD this, BPD that"" for everyone. Of course, there are patterns and I am glad that I can see them clearly now and have been actively working against them, BUT it's not like this is ingrained in my bones. It's not as if this is who I am.

I can explain my behaviour, but so can anyone else who is not experiencing the results of year-long abuse and neglect. They simply have less extreme outcomes to deal with. They might yell at someone out of the blue, because the bus today was late, then they got splashed with cold water, then it started raining and the umbrella they brought suddenly disappeared and now they've got a stressful meeting to get to and the barista at the coffee shop is just so slow that they are in danger of being late to this highly important meeting and suddenly they explode and scream at a person who has done nothing wrong, but meet them at the wrong day. You go back all those steps and any sane person would say: ""Yeah, that's truly understandable. You poor thing!"", but without that info, most will just be like: ""What an asshole!""

I guess, what I am trying to say here is: Please do not put too much emphasis on your diagnosis and try to find in any and every reaction or behaviour of yours a sign of how this is BPD and this is you being a bad/inherently evil or even broken/defective person. It was an immense relief for me to finally just acknowledge that nothing I do, think or feel is in any way ""crazy"" considering my messed up past with people using and abusing me in all kinds of different ways. This however does come also with the responsibility of saying: ""I am the master of my own life."" And I am also not always blameless. Just like any other human being I've hurt others and I've made mistakes. Something my therapist and friends also continued to tell me: I wasn't in control of things in the past and there was nothing I could do as a kid, but I am not a child anymore. No matter how unfair it might have been to me, there is no way around to finding the adult in myself without having had parents to help me grow up in a healthy way. I didn't have a childhood and will never have one - period. But that doesn't mean, I am unable to have a great life from hereon forth. I honestly hate feeling all this responsibility, to be completely honest. The child in me hates it. But it's good. It's healthy. It's what I need to do. And I think somewhere deep within it's what is hard for each and everyone: To truly grow up.

I used to have such a fragile ego from all that anger and lashing out at me in my family that I couldn't take even the smallest of criticism, thinking: ""Why does everyone want to hurt me? Haven't I suffered enough?"" To be honest, I still sometimes feel pretty shitty, thinking, I want to just be able to jump into someone's arms, be cuddled and told that everything is gonna be ok and that they would make sure to treat me well, but I've realized that this is especially the child in me who wants their childhood filled with security and unconditional love. But I need to grow up into a respectable adult, knowing that I am me and only me and I need to take responsibility for this life of mine and everything I do. I still look through material on BPD and psychological illnesses, but I don't want to use those as excuses or explanations to others. I want to look at those things and think about what I for myself think I can change to be better for me and maybe someday future family that I might have.

Just felt like getting this out there.

I wish you all well and the best on your own journeys. Need to put some work into mine as well and continue doing this, but I am optimistic for a better life for all of us (and every human being in general) as long as we continue trying to make the best of this life of ours."
Working full time can be far too difficult,4,ml0log,1,"I work full time at a warehouse job where all I do all day is fix broken packages and send them back out. A lot of the time the packages are very heavy and by the second half of the shift I’m physically exhausted. It’s a very unfulfilling and laborious job that especially bothers me because it has nothing to do with the degree I pursued in college. I’m wanting to find a better job but I need to wait until I can afford to fix my laptop first. Due to my diagnosis of both BPD and bipolar disorder I deal with constant intense mood swings that I only just got medication to curb, and last week I went into my boss’s office holding back tears saying I was too depressed to work that day and had to go home. Thankfully he understood, but I don’t know how tenable holding down this job will be in the future. I want to quit but I need to make sure I have another job secured first, since I live on my own and far from home."
Fml,4,ml0lib,1,I hate my life. I hate myself. I hate my anger. I hate everything. I might not deserve anything that’s why bad shit happens to me this fucking illness that makes me a really hateable person everybody around me only caring about other peoples feelings and not mine
Feeling super triggered rn,1,ml6ce4,0,"All I'm trying to do is host a bbq this Saturday. Why is this so triggering? I've ended up inviting 10 people which is way too many considering the circumstances also my parents wouldn't alow that many. I'm so so paranoid that everyone secretly hates me and are making up excuses to not come. I'm being super needy asking for confirmation because I can't stand when people say ""maybe"". I'm worried that it will be a flop and I'll make a fool of myself. Idk what to do."
DAE stop caring?,8,mkuwqa,0,"I feel like because I care so much about other people and about what they think of me, it gets to be overwhelming to the point where sometimes I need to turn it off. And when I turn it off, it is the best feeling in the world. I just don't give a fuck. I hate everyone. No one matters to me. Everyone can go fuck themselves, I just don't care. I feel free. I feel like I unshackled myself from the prison my mind keeps me in and I can run free. Not giving a fuck about what anyone thinks the the most free I've ever felt in my life. I love that feeling. It's my favorite feeling.

This is of course short lived. Because that crippling guilt creeps up and chains you back into the prison of your own mind making you feel ashamed for ever thinking those things. Making you feel stupid for believing you could be free. Making you feel bad for not caring about other people and their views of you."
DBT isn’t working and I don’t know what to do,1,ml690s,1,"Note: I’m sorry about my grammar I don’t know English well and when I was signed up for my English class I ended up in the hospital and had to drop it and my counselor isn’t helping me join the class so ya.

So I’ve tried DBT for a year and I’m going to be honest it’s just not working and my psychologist is constantly booked so I have no one to talk to about my problems when I absolutely need to. I recently had my biggest breakdown because of my bpd pretty sure I could’ve gotten myself killed if I did said action to the wrong person then again that person really chose to fudge me over when I was on my last straw. So leading up to this event which occurred Monday or Tuesday (last week) Sunday my boyfriends dad basically gave us an eviction notice and of course Monday I had my behind the wheel test I was stressed the whole time and the guy that was with me profiled my instructor he said “I haven’t seen his kind around here” which really got me going I ended up failing which didn’t make me upset but ya and I found out at the end of the day that my boyfriends dad just said what he said to get us riled up I’m not sure if it was this day or the day after when the straw just broke and I was at Starbucks with my mom and this black suv cut us off and oh my god that was just it I got out stood in front of her car and said “Back the fudge up” then she tried to argue with me saying she didn’t see us HOW DO YOU NOT SEE A YUKON XL THAT IS BIGGER THAN YOUR TAHOE YOU’RE EITHER USED TO FUDGING PEOPLE OVER OR YOU’RE RECKLESS AND DON’T WATCH WHERE YOU ARE DRIVING then she tried to scare me by driving up closer I told her I wasn’t letting her ruin my day even more then the passenger told her something and she backed out and drove off. I messaged my psychologist right after  then felt helpless because he said I should go to the DBT class again which he knows I don’t have time for (work) and when I called his office the next morning because I thought hey maybe they’ll let me have a one time appointment with a different psychologist that’s available they told me no and that they were going to transfer me to a suicide hotline which pissed me off all I did was ask for someone to speak to."
newly diagnosed,4,mkyfky,5,"just got diagnosed officially w bpd last week. my psychiatrist suspected for a while that i might have it and though i knew it was a very likely possibility i guess i wasn’t truly prepared to hear that i really do have it?? although it feels good to finally know for sure that i have bpd i can’t help but feel overwhelmed and so fucking scared???? i don’t want to be a burden for the rest of my life. i have other mental illnesses along w bpd and i’m struggling to accept it all even though i’ve been very open about my mental health for many years??? it just feels weird i guess.
what helped u guys accept yourselves after u got diagnosed?? would rlly appreciate some advice <333 thank u !!"
Does anyone else have a difficult time not feeling empty in a normal (ie non-toxic) relationship?,6,mkvjme,2,"I have a very hard time feeling pretty much anything when hanging out with relatively okay people. It's fine but for some reason, I just can't truly feel anything, not even towards them. It leads me into platonic and romantic relationships with people who are either outright abusive or are simply bad for me in some way (eg they have problems of their own that are simply totally incompatible with mine and it makes us both suffer). It's like I can't live unless I'm suffering and can't love unless I'm in fear. I don't know if I'm making any sense but it just feels like it's like what Keaton Henson said: ""I'm a writer who's nothing if he's not in Hell.""  I theorise that it's because I've never known normal relationships during my childhood and I guess it just profoundly affected something in me. 

But I'm wondering if anyone else is like this. It weighs heavily on my life and honestly, it is something that I find rather embarrassing to admit, so I'd like to know if I'm not alone in this and if anyone actually knows why this happens and if I can do anything about it."
Routines,10,mksgvn,4,"Does anyone else have strict routines they create for themselves? I follow mostly the same routine each day depending on the day of the week. Foods go with certain days of the week. I follow the exact same morning schedule to the minute. More or less I do the same things in the same ways every day and I do not get bored. In fact, if I’m unable to do my routines I feel very thrown off and unstable. I wonder if anyone else creates routines for safety and the illusion of control?"
DAE get really overwhelmed with intimacy after a breakup?,17,mknley,15,"I recently was broken up with by my boyfriend of five years; we had future plans and honestly my untreated BPD pushed him away. (We didn’t know I had BPD until last year though). 

I went out on a date last night and it was really fun, the guy was really sweet too. But anytime he tried to like hold my hand or lean in for a kiss I totally freaked out and got extremely uncomfortable. I woke up this morning feeling guilty. I started crying and missing my ex a lot. I just don’t want anyone to touch me but my ex I guess and I’m feeling overwhelmed and frustrated."
"I have decided that I will not share about BPD, other mental health issues, etc. with new people anymore",20,mklsqk,5,"People who have known me for a long time can already guess. Maybe it were the memes i shared as a teenager, or just how open and frank and loud i was. I had no shame because i knew it isn't my fault. Overall, it felt great to share.

But i am not a teenager anymore. I have entered my 20s and along the way, i have had many experiences which have taught me to have stronger boundaries and \*not\* talk about mental illness much. sure a meme about depression here and there won't hurt, tho it might if you are employed. but otheriwse, leave it to the anonymous awareness raising instagram accounts.

An abusive POS dated me and found me appealing, and my BPD had a huge role to play in it. He thought 'troubled women' are sexy. I used to self harm regularly back then, had terrible self esteem, was suicidal. He loved it. He even asked me to send photographs of my scars.

I have been called mentally ill and sick during arguments. My BPD has become a point for hurtful personal attacks. Hell, even on Reddit, when i argued with a man for saying women deserve to be raped for the way they dress, he came back at me and called me insane, crazy, sick, that i deserved everything that happened to me, that BPD women should be 'used for sex and discarded'. It was very, very hurtful. Ofc the memory doesn't hurt me anymore but it stung for a v long time.

I used to be open about it on dating apps ( i don't use them anymore and i love it) because I believed everyone deserves to know about it before we proceed further. Almost all ignore anyway. And others think it makes me an interesting person. Awareness about BPD in my country is extremely low.

Not to forget how my exes brought it up whenever i got mad at them for very valid reasons. I can see it all clearly in hindsight now, but back then i couldn't.

I have been quarantined for a year,and single too. God i love being single. I really can't imagine being treated nicely, being loved anymore. I used to dream of a happy ending but i have lost my faith. It was a huge fucking deal for someone like me, it's like i did a 180. Anyway, that's not the point.

The point is, whenever i have been honest, it backfired. People use it to personally attack me, invalidate it and say it's no big deal (THIS is the worst i swear, i don't share because i am not ready to be told how it's not that bad), fetishize it. Overall, they don't undertsand, and make no attempts to.

Hence, I have decided to not share. Anonymous spaces like these are alright, but not outside. Not even memes and jokes about 'lighter' topics like low self esteem. People prey on you when you do that. I worry it might be unethical? But honestly, i choose my protection over ethics. If they make efforts to really know and love me, then yes. Otherwise, no. I pretend to be stoic and healthy. I come off as secretive and weird but that's better than being perceived as 'troubled'.

what do y'all think? do you share your struggles?"
just came to me that no one will ever care for me the way that i do them,2,ml1q7f,0,i know i should accept that people react and show affection differently but it kills me i get so annoyed at how everyone constantly doesn’t show their emotions i try my hardest to prove to people in my life that i love and care for them so much but they never do the same?? it’s at a point that they never even remember a thing i tell them about myself i know i can’t expect everyone to be like me and show affection like me but it’s so annoying because i’m always the one to rush to help and care honestly now i’m avoiding meeting anyone because i know they’ll leave or make me feel like shit i go out of my way to do things for people to make them know i love them but no one ever does the same for me it’s so upsetting
This is the worst I have felt in years.,15,mknde0,1,"I cut myself today after 6 years. I was so stressed out, my friends have abandoned me I’m burdening my family and I’m gaining weight. I hate my life. My past and present and whatever its going to be leading to. Kill me now. I don’t want to do this anymore. I’ll never be happy or loved. I’m so tired. My head is going to explode"
Does anybody feel hurt when their friends find partners?,24,mkkgkt,6,"
I want to be happy for them and i love that they found love but i feel so betrayed and left. I feel like if they found someone so close to them, they won't care about me anymore.

I'm so scared, because I'm always the omega on everybody's list. I'm never anybody's priority and like, that ok because I'm awful but it still hurts when their list of priorities gets longer and it pushes you even further down.

Sometimes (i fucking hate myself for this) if i have a close (especially male)  friend and we talk about everything and because of the understanding and support i try to give them, they open up to me, and then after time, they find a partner i get SO angry. i would never tell them but it feels like as if I'm their therapist and when i ""help"" them, they move on to something better and don't want to be friends with me. like I'm not even a person to them"
Nowhere to go. It’s okay as long as I don’t think. [21 m],6,mku6lz,7,"I don’t know how much of this has to do with my bpd. But here’s my vent:

On the last day of February, I impulsively packed my clothes and my camera, and drove east, away from my coastal SoCal hometown, without telling anyone.  I didn’t have a destination, I just followed what felt right. I ended up in Palm Springs, and being freshly 21, I drank a lot that week.  I had savings to last only like 10 days. I was searching for work in person  and online. Applying everywhere. 
I did yard work for an old guy. Hard stuff, spiky cacti. I was shaking at one point and he told me to stop and come inside. He gave me some water and made a sandwich. I hadn’t slept the night before and only had caffeine and Ritalin in me and it was obvious. 
The rest of that week was a blur. I didn’t get hired anywhere. I tried escorting (just hanging out) but the first guy didn’t pay and that discouraged me. At the end of the week I got in a fight with a good friend of mine and i realized she thinks I’m a burden.  She’s a raging narcissist anyway and had been gaslighting me into thinking my art was bad and that I’m not as smart as her for years now. 
I didn’t know what to do but I saw a wall in the distance with the word “art” on it.  Not very subtle.  So I started taking pictures, what I originally wanted to do when I set out on this trip: document the desert towns with a focus on the intersection of vintage and postmodern americana . 

And then I started being drawn toward Arizona. My best friend J lives there, and he’d invited me to come stay with him and his girlfriend several times. So I texted him and said I was coming. 
I ended up getting tired and sleeping in Salome, to his dissapointment.
 The next day I show up and meet his girlfriend, he’s not home yet so I talk to her for an hour or so.  We get along pretty well. J comes home and I say “hey bud,” and hug him. We all watched a movie that night. 

3 weeks go by in a blur. I got a job at a restaurant pretty fast: expo and host. 
And I feel close to both of them, J and his girlfriend. But also far away. Sometimes I’d feel  anxious and like I had to leave.  I wonder if they hate me. I gave them opportunities to tell me I have to leave. 
One time i went to Walmart with J and I started dissociating, or maybe it was a very quiet and low energy panic attack. I sat and stared at a stack of Pepsi boxes. He said I was being weird and went to the car. He called me and said “it’s been 20 minutes. Just stop. You can choose to get up.” 
I was having trouble speaking. But I managed to say “you’re a smart guy J, but you’re very stupid when it comes to stuff like this.” 
After half an hour I managed to get up, pay, and leave. I got in the car in silence, and it took me a while to realize J was taking the long way home, and then eventually realize not home at all. He was driving us into the mountain. It was maybe 10 pm. Neither of us were saying anything. I was still feeling unreal and meaningless. He pulled over and we both got out. It was a full moon. I followed alongside him, we walked down a trail in the forest, just for a little while. I couldn’t help but think it was funny that his solution to a friend having a panic attack was to drive them into the woods at night and then take them for a walk. Part of me was thinking once we got deep enough he was gonna take out his gun and dispose of me for being defective. I wasn’t scared at all though, and I wouldn’t have minded if he did shoot me. At some point he turned back and I did too. We got back in the car and he started driving. I managed to say “it’s really pretty out here..... thanks for taking me.”  
He said we could come back and take pictures or light fireworks sometime.  I appreciated him in that moment.  

Theres a guy at work I wanted to be friends with.  I’d hope to be scheduled to work alongside him, but eventually I realized that the days I worked without him I was actually happier.  
I made a friend outside work, he gave me a lighter. I  gave my number to a girl who works at Goodwill. She texted me a lot and I almost regret it. 
On April 2nd, a day late so as to avoid confusion, J and his girlfriend informed me that their landlord discovered my existence, and said it was a lease violation for me to be their longer than 2 weeks. It’d been 3 weeks.  They said I could stay a few more days. But I felt like I couldn’t.  The next morning I packed all my things and left for work. After I met up with lighter friend and he helped me find the cheapest motel online, and my phone wouldn’t charge so he gave me his charger, to keep.  I felt like I was using him.  I gave him some licorice and a cigarette.  I couldn’t stay at his place. I left 10 minutes later.  I texted goodwill girl. Couldn’t stay at her place either, she lives with her grandparents.  
 
J texted me asking if I was coming back. An hour later I texted back that I didn’t know. 
I couldn’t sleep that night, the motel made me anxious. 

The next day at work I told myself I was gonna ask Work Friend if he needed a roommate. Instead I quickly realized I was tired and slow and in a mood, and eventually he took me aside and told me that everyone thinks I’m high. I hated that. I wasn’t high I was tired and  feeling like my life was pointless because I spent 3 weeks worth of pay on 1 week of a motel room. It wasn’t sustainable, I was gonna have to go back to my hometown, and live with my family again.  Everyone was weird to me at work. Rude even. Telling me to snap out of it. Don’t stand around. Pay attention. I hated it. I’m smarter than them even with my brain underwater, they just don’t know it.  And I’m normally a very hard and fast worker.  Not even work friend seemed to be on my side after a while.  Later that evening I found him on Facebook (everyone in this town uses Facebook for some reason) and I texted him asking if he needed a roomate or knew anyone that did. He said he didn’t but he’d keep an “ear out” and I should try “Gregg’s List.”   That was the final feeling of defeat.   I wanted to just say “ I don’t think anyone understands that they’ll never see me again.... or worse, they understand and don’t care.”   I wanted him to know that he doesn’t have time to get to know me better.  But there’s no way to say that.  There’s no way to say a lot of the things I want to say without sounding crazy. 

I haven’t quite decided if I’m going to live in my car and continue going to work. Or if I’m going to go back home. I have until Saturday the 10th to decide, that’s when I check out of the motel.  

There’s nothing worth staying here for but there’s nothing worth going back home for. 
I really have nothing going for me. No one cares about me the right way or cares if I’m there or not. 

In some form, on a very fundamental level inside me, I’ve given up.


TLDR: I ran away to Arizona to stay with my best friend and his gf. It’s been a month.  I’m now homeless, or will be on Saturday. and no one at my job has fallen in love with me enough to take me in.  I feel like I’ve been playing a role this whole time and it’s all been in my head.

Update:  accidentally sliced my thumb open with an exacto knife trying to make a stencil for a bleach dye t shirt at a park. Started gently dropping and wiping  the blood on the drawing and it looked really good and at some point I realized that maybe something /is/ wrong .  It doesn’t need stitches I don’t think.  Just another obstacle on this journey to live a simple small town life ."
I dont know if/how I could hold on longer,3,mkyjcr,2,"I currently have been doing work for a call center at a luxury company. I hate it so much. I've been doing it since August 2020. It's remote which I should be thankful for. Every shift feels like I'm dragging my feet. Today I just couldn't do it. There's been other days like today but today it was like I couldnt even just sit there and not do the work. Sometimes I slack off and it's fine but I hate the phone calls so much--I haven't done them at capacity for awhile which I feel guilty for. Days they have me do other tasks I feel better, but when i've asked to be put on other stuff more they say ""it all depends on capacity"". I've been looking for a new job since I started 

Every job I've found I get to the final stages of interviews and it falls through, even if I think the interview went well there's always someone better. Today I found out I officially didn't get a big job I was excited about after following up (I got to the point that I knew because I hadnt heard from them for a while)  but it still hurts. I had done an internship there before and it was for the ultimate entry level thing. 

I just feel like I'm never going to get out of my job. I would love to quit but I cannot get unemployment if I quit. I know I'll feel like shit if they eventually fire me, but I think that's the only path to unemployment. 

It just feels like I'm always tipping over the edge and I feel like shit all of the time. I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, I just wanted to vent and seeing stories of people relating helps me. I just don't know if I can do it much longer."
DAE have physical symptoms with BPD?,3,mkwj1t,7,"
My question: so I haven’t been diagnosed with BPD yet and I’m going back to the doctor on Thursday. Does anyone have physical symptoms that come with the BPD? For example, dizziness, lightheadedness, room spinning sensation, severe nausea, “brain zaps”, vision problems (like everything looks “shiny” or blurry), heart palpitations. 

Context: I’ve had a ton of problems with mental illness since childhood and was first treated when I turned 17, as a punishment. “You’re acting up, so clearly you need mental help”. 

I’ve been treated for anxiety (GAD, social anxiety, and OCD) and depression, and more recently Bipolar. I’ve had horrible luck with psychiatrists- they mostly just listen to me say “well I think I have bipolar, anxiety, etc because of x,y,z” and then give me meds for that diagnosis.  Therapy has helped on and off but it’s mostly just coping skills that don’t really help when my physical symptoms are so bad.

Basically, I’ve never had relief from my symptoms.  So recently, I’ve looked into BPD: I’ve done some research, found that I relate to a lot of the indicators, and I found this group and relate to a lot here as well, more than anything I’ve previously been diagnosed with."
i hate my fp,19,mkl5cj,3,"i didn’t want to care for you. i tried to be distant when we became friends so i wouldn’t get attached. you were stupid enough to think you wanted me in your life and i hate you for it now. i hate that you have moved on and i’m still stuck here pretending i’m not in love with you. 
i hate that you can tell i still care for you more than i should. you probably think i’m pathetic. this is your fault. i never fucking wanted this. 
i wish i could just cut you out of my life right now but i’m selfish and i don’t know how to exist without you. you know i’d forgive you for anything. 
i wish you were an awful person so it would be easier for me to convince myself i need to let go of you. i wish you would tell me to fuck off so i could have an excuse to tell you that you’re just as pathetic as i am."
Probably getting dropped by therapist,3,mkwe3u,6,"My therapist used to let me text him on a regular basis... fucked that up by losing my temper more than once... now we have an agreement that I can email as needed, but I still get overwhelmed and impulsive, sending emails that insinuate suicide sometimes... I don't even realize that I've crossed a line sometimes, and other times suicide really is on my mind... ALOT... I have to respect his boundaries, but I'm very timid in sessions, so alot of what I really feel never actually gets said... hence writing it down in email or previously in texts... I'm sure he's tired of me because, well, I'm tired of me. How do I stop being so impulsive??? I just want to feel better."
I know.....,8,mksd1p,1,I know I’m not the most “beautiful” I hate it when people say I am. I know they are lying. Just be honest. I don’t even care about being the best. However it feels like others see that as important. They think I’m being self deprecating.  I’m not. I just feel like I’m being honest with myself. I’m not as smart as I use to be which use to be my redeeming qualifying. I feel like a failure.
Some feeling between jealousy and anxiety,1,ml4mpa,0,I am going to start taking therapy from some psychologist at the weekend and i decided to look at her photos. When i looked at them i noticed that i got restless for some fucking reason. Im not even sure but i think i felt like something bad was going to happen to her or i felt jealous. This happens to me when i have an fp in my life. Seeing them around other people really gives me anxiety. I dont even know why this is happening. Any ideas?
Periods of low to no empathy?,1,ml4b9o,2,"Hi guys! This is my first time making a post here. I'm struggling currently with feeling much of anything. I've landed on the numb side the past few days. But I haven't even been able to feel empathy? I go through these periods where I cant feel anything at all, even empathy. No deep thoughts, no meaningful sentences. It's like my brain took a vacation. Anyone else out there?"
Partner always mad at or annoyed with me,5,mkskg5,8,"My boyfriend is annoyed with me most of the time. And no, this isn’t the “all or nothing” thoughts that most of us with BPD recognize. 

He has misophonia so when I’m chewing food, drinking a beverage, blowing my nose, cleaning my teeth etc, he’ll be annoyed. But it’s also just our communication style that isn’t working at all and resulted in physical altercations recently which I wouldn’t have predicted a couple of years ago. I feel like I can’t do anything right which is a huge trigger for me that brings back trauma and feelings of worthlessness resulting is suicidal thoughts. 

I try to find more information on aggressive behavior towards the partner with BPD but most are forums or articles about an aggressive partner with BPD. 

I tried therapy by myself but also couples therapy and give him articles to read about BPD and triggers but it’s only getting worse. My feelings of depression won’t subside and I’m just sad and tired, not being able to do regular tasks or achieve goals because of it. Resulting in more anger of the partner towards me because I’m not bringing enough to the table. I’m becoming desperate and I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel really bad about myself and am convinced I can’t do anything right. I’ve been dissociating for a couple of days now, just to cope. 

Does anyone have any articles on anger towards someone with BPD? I’ve encountered it multiple times with different people causing traumatic experiences.

Edit: I’m the one with BPD, my BF has no psychological issues (that we are aware of)."
Executive dysfunction,7,mkqdhr,4,"I really need advice on how to handle days like this, where it isnt my depression/anxiety or BPD particularly bothering me, but I cant do literally ANYTHING but i want to soooooo badly!! Like I have 0 other things to do today so realistically I could be using this time to do something like art or learn an instrument or anything at all that would benefit me, the motivation is there like I'd love to be doing it but I just cant.

Please someone tell me they can relate? I've spent hours just sitting here staring at 4 walls just wishing I could do something before the day is done but no such luck. I really relate this to possible undiagnosed ADHD/ADD but I'm not even sure getting a diagnosis would help. Also think it could be that I didn't develop any interests as a child because mentally illness and family shit was going on and I couldn't focus.

Someone please help😭😭😭"
Advice Please. I feel like I’m deactivating,5,mkuqup,1,"I just had a long talk with my friends about a fight we’ve had the night before. I have never lashed out at this group before (I’ve gotten much better at controlling myself over time) but I threatened to cut all of them off because I thought they were shit talking me. They got super mad. 

I understood them being mad at me losing my temper but I didn’t get why they would care if I cut them off. I called with them and they explained why it hurt their feelings but I’m struggling to feel remorse over my threat. I do feel bad when I really think about it, but they keep telling me I need to trust them more and that upsets me. What if I don’t want to trust them? 


I feel bad for hurting them but I also feel like they shouldn’t be hurt by that comment. I kind of want to cut all of them off anyways. I feel like the friendship has run it’s course. But I know they consider me one of their best friends. But I don’t feel like they know the real me. When I told one of them I have BPD, they said they thought my “therapist is wrong”. Actual quote. If anything that proves how much they don’t know the real me...


I think i’m splitting right now. I usually have a lot of love for these people. A lot. But right now I feel like their relationship is draining me. Idk. How do I snap out of splitting? How do I stay motivated to put effort into a friendship? 

I used to be more anxiously attached but I feel like i’m moving towards more fearful avoidant because for the first time I feel like exiting relationships rather than feeling anxious about them ending. Idk. I know logically i’m being selfish. Advice please. Someone knock some sense into me. These are really good people, why doesn’t my brain want to accept that. Why don’t I feel like I miss them."
"I’m lost. Tried to get into two different residentials, both of which denied me for my physical health.",2,mkzdnh,2,"So I went to Acute and we made a plan for IOP.
Then I got denied IOP because my mental health is so unstable I was told I needed residential. 
Then we went through a long admissions process, only to be told that I didn’t qualify because I have a chronic illness in addition to my mental illnesses.
So then I found a second place and they said the same fucking thing.
I’m so lost and I have nowhere to go. Fuck my life. Back to self harm we go I guess. I can’t cope anymore."
DAE have PMDD and BPD? DAE have more severe symptoms while taking BC? It’s been years before I considered this???,2,mkyb6q,9,"
Bottom line up front: has anyone with PMDD and BPD taken birth control- or had a hormonal IUD and it made symptoms way worse? Could I actually be much better after I stop BC?

background: a few years ago I got a hormonal IUD put in. I’ve never taken birth control before. At the same time I was going through a LOT. Workplace (military) abuse, family abandonment, my best friend in the ICU... I have BPD, right, so I never considered that my IUD might be *worsening* any symptoms. I just thought it because I was being triggered by all of this.

I had periods only twice-ish a year before BC. During PMS I would get SEVERELY, consistently suicidal, compulsively self harming, with more psychotic symptoms too. I’m not diagnosed with PMDD (but I mean, I feel I have something like that...)

Anyway, now I’m taking a BC pill along with my recently expired IUD at my gynecologist’s recommendation (insurance issue) so that’s a lot of hormones.

I am MARKEDLY worse, beginning from the same week that I started the pill. Even worse than I typically am. Double worse. I have periods twice a month and I’ve been on the edge of being admitted on and off since I started the pill. 

Does anyone have a problem with birth control? If I get my IUD removed and stop taking the pill, do I have hope of maybe relieving some of this constant AGONY? :( could I be right?"
Constant worry about BPD,0,ml26dv,1,"Ive recently read the symptoms of BPD and now I cant get the thought of it out of my head. I have constant anxiety/panic that I have this disorder. I fear it. Im scared that im not the person I thought I was. Im scared  constantly. 

Ive had anxiety/panic disorder for about 10 years. Its always been health related. There were times in the past where I had convinced myself that I had some sort of cancer or was schizo. These panic episodes would last weeks. My anxiety has always been ""breathing"" related. I would constantly search for that satisfying breath feeling. If I didnt get it, id panic for about 20 minutes.

Most recently, I had an episode of ""not getting a satisfying breath"" that lasted much longer than normal and that really got my anxiety going again. So much that I started to see a therapist, who suggested I have OCD. After about 3 weeks I started to feel better. 

Now, due to anxiety about recently becoming a father. I started to google why im not attached to my baby. Why I felt some anger and resentment towards him. I convinced myself that im a psycopath and theres no helping me. Reason being, I hurt cats as a kid. I have so much guilt and hate myself for it. Im a total animal lover now. I wish I could undo what I did as a kid. I wish I could go back in time and show nothing but love to those cats that I beat. But even with this guilt, I convinced myself im a psycopath. Im afraid that when im angry ill hurt my son.

 It went from bad to worse when I read about BPD. For 4 days now ive constantly been worrying and panicking that I have this disorder. Here are some of my symptoms :

-Fear abandonment : GF goes out of town, I panic, I feel alone. During high episodes of anxiety, ive cried on her lap asking her not to leave me because of my anxiety.

-Hypersexuality : I have a GF whom I love. We have a great sex life. But im constantly thinking about sex with other women. Even shortly after having sex with her. Im constantly aroused. I look at almost every attractive woman that passes me by, and I think about having sex with them. I had previously thought that this is just how all, or most men think. Ive never cheated on my GF. And the times Ive ""thought"" about it, I felt guilt. I told myself no way I could ever hurt her. Ill admit I like being flirtatious with women. But I wont ever actually cheat on her.

-Perfectionism : I organize my entire apartment the way I want it. Every detail of it. I constantly clean and wipe down counters, organize clutter, and place things where I want them to be. 

-Impulsive : Ive gone on some pretty bad spending sprees. Again didnt think anything abnormal about it because I feel like I manage my money well. But if I set my mind on something, I feel like I have to have it. Ive bought myself a lot of crap that I dont need recently.

-low self esteem : Im overweight. I constantly think about getting into shape but never do. I dont feel confidenent that I can accomplish much outside of what ive already done.

-Hear whatever I need to hear : Im not a good listener. When someone is speaking, im already planning my next words. This is especially true during arguments with my GF. I feel like Im always right. She has even pointed this out to me in the past.

-Ive had recent memory lapses. I can be a little sarcastic at times. I have mood swings and feelings of emptimess. 

Like I said im seeking therapy over the next couple of days. Id just like some input here."
DAE experience paranoia that isn't transient?,5,mksy94,0,"Long story short, I wanted to rent a room in an apartment that had four people currently living there. I met the tenant I'd be replacing, let's call him **Roomie 1,** and received a tour of the unit and property. I loved it! During the tour, he told me one of the roommates is a chef. Okay, cool :)

I researched the property afterward and found *another* listing for that same unit on a different site under one of the *other* roommates, and it was for a different room in that unit. Okay, that means there are multiple vacancies then, and not just one? I figured he'd tell me that.  I Google'd the roommate who posted *that* listing, let's call him **Roomie 2**, and the first search result was a chef— but he lives in a completely different state. This chef is kind of well-known where he's from, so I assumed **Roomie 1** was being deceptive about the living situation because why lie about the chef living there if he clearly is based somewhere else?

The chef's instagram also shows he clearly doesn't live in *this* state and never did, so then my mind convinced me they were *both* trying to pull a sublease scam on me or something. I looked online for every possible scam tenants could use against people looking to rent a room in their unit, and my mind just spiraled out of control. When **Roomie 1** texted or called me after he had the property manager send me the application, I just ignored him. I didn't even want to fill out the application because it'd mean putting my banking and credit info, which I worried would be stolen. 

Turns out the chef I found online isn't **Roomie 2**, and there's another person with the same name who lives here and is most likely the real **Roomie 2**. Had I just Google'd the name in the listing with the city and state, I would've known that from the beginning. DAE experience this intense level of paranoia and distrust for *everyone*, to the point that they become a PI and start over-analyzing everything and everyone's intentions? This is more than *those two people sitting on the park bench across from me are whispering* ***so it's 100% about me****.* This is *any apartment I show interest in* ***will be a scam.*** I feel awful now because **Roomie 1** was looking for someone to replace him because he has to move for a job. I just complicated that process because I'm a nutjob."
I like disassociating,45,mkec5h,5,"It’s the only time I feel true peace and I don’t have to experience being me. I purposefully disassociate and I smoke lots of weed too so that doesn’t help. Sometimes I go so deep into an episode that my eyes will be completely open but everything around me is blank and my whole body is numb, like i’m turning into my surroundings and i’m not in my body. When this happens it feels like i’m stuck and can’t move. It happens anytime i’m not stimulated. Mainly in showers but it could be anywhere ESPECIALLY if I have a stressful thought about an fp or something. I can see why people would find it scary but is it normal to enjoy it?"
Can y'all tell me if I jumped the gun?,7,mkpfbv,7,"This probably needs backstop and honestly I need to get it out anyway.
My bf (23M) and I (23F) have been together for 5 years.
Last year around this time my bf and I were going through some shit and almost broke up, I will admit that our major problem was my insecurity and jealousy over a female friend of his. Since then I've been to therapy, gotten resources and have seriously started working on myself. I am basically completely different (I of course still have those jealousy and insecurity but I don't voice it now and I let it pass when it acts up.)
So over the year we've gotten a better. But now that my crap is all sorted I've noticed a lot of issues on his part, issues that I can't overlook. 
Like making excuses when he doesn't want to do something (ex. I have to clean my room, I'm going to br grumpy so I don't want to ruin your night.) His room is filthy and I can't stand being there, so his cleaning excuse is always a complete lie. He lays in bed until 11 am when he's with me and when I try to get him up he snaps at me to just leave him alone. I can go days without a message from him.
I know he's depressed but the way he treats me seems to be unforgivable. It's like I'm just an obstacle in his way, and vice versa.
So, where I ask if I jumped the gun is this- I put our relationship on pause and have decided to take a month apart to see how I feel. If at the end of this month I find he cannot or will not change, I'm breaking it off for good. Is that too far? I would prefer people not to just tell me to end it completely because I won't listen to that and frankly it's.mot constructive. I'm asking if I took an appropriate approach to the situation or if I should've let it carry on because its not even that bad, I love him but I'm starting to love myself to."
"Motivation, primarily with weight loss",2,mkx8sv,2,"After a pretty traumatic 12 months I’m trying to get my life back on track by focusing on my physical health. I feel like if I can get my physical health in line then my mental health will be easier to tackle. My problem is I have absolutely no motivation to do even the smallest things. 

What steps can I take to improve my motivation? I’m literally starting from 0 so anything to help me get some rhythm would be appreciated."
You all are valid. Period.,199,mk5uk6,13,"You are all valid. That’s all I want to say. No matter what you’ve been through, it’s valid. So many of us have been through trauma and abuse that hasn’t been recognized. And I just want to say, you’re valid. You’re seen. You’re recognized.
This is a horrible disease. So many of us are lost, and it’s a loss. BPD doesn’t have to mean the end. I lost my aunt to it, and it hurt my whole family. BPD isn’t the end. Please know this. There are people who care about you. This group is proof!!"
age regression,2,mku9xx,2,"this is super embarrassing to talk about, i think i told like 3 people privately.
I've read that age regression is common in Bpd as coping mechanism but is there anyone who actually does it frequently?

it doesn't happen to me often but when stressed i sometimes do slip into ""little space"". which is, again, super embarrassing to admit for me personally, especially since im a man"
GF said its a courtesy to tell me anything,3,mku5n1,9,"My girlfriend decides to tell me that shes going to meet up with a friend this week. This friend only talks to my gf when her other friends are on bad terms with her. When her friend has no one else to lean on is when she calls my gf. I told my gf that this friend is a fake friend and only using her. That started a fight. My gf mentioned how she was doing me a courtesy by telling me her plans that she didnt have to tell me anything. I responded with yes you do, youre in a committed relationship, you have to be honest and open. She also said how i just want to control her. This is bringing me doubts again and i wish she would see what i see. I dont care if she has friends but that friend is not a real friend.

Am I in the wrong ? Its hard to recognize if im self sabotaging or its reality."
How do I stop freaking out,1,ml1cjl,1,"I have been a complete wreck recently. I have been unable to focus on the smallest task, I’ve been cutting myself more and more, and my thoughts have become more abstract and self harming. Within the last hour, i have thought

- I want to smack my head into the sidewalk and crack my skull open. I don’t want to die, I just want to feel the pain
- I want to break everything around me
- I want to shave off all my hair
- I want to cut off my fingers
- that there was someone behind me (I live alone)
- (this one is a bit weird to explain) my thoughts were smooth (like my head felt like it was a hard boiled egg, clogged and uniform)
- jumping off a bridge into a suicide net to see how long it would take for people to see me
- etc

There has been so much screaming in my head its impossible to focus on any task and I exhaust and stress myself out so much that I don’t have the energy to do anything once these episodes are over. Is there anything I can do to help mitigate or stope these thoughts and feelings? Im currently between therapists, don’t have meds, and have no one to talk to irl."
Managing FP Feelings,6,mkq329,0,"My favorite person attachments were what first brought me to therapy a few years ago and to me, are the most euphoric and wonderful but also the most distressing part of my BPD. Since starting therapy, I’ve increasingly been able to recognize when someone is starting to become an FP for me and work to use strategies to keep the relationship a close but appropriate and not so obsessive one. My current therapist is my FP and I’ve made a ton of progress with her. I’ve recently been able to, for the first time maybe ever, feel a desire to make friends and find a partner and community and to create intimate relationships beyond my FP (who at this moment, is her). Despite this, and maybe it’s just that I don’t have those relationships yet, I often feel like she is still the only one whose care, reassurance, etc. feels like it can fulfill what I’m seeking. Like if I heard the same words from her vs from a friend the ones from her would be so powerful and the ones from a friend would just fall flat. We’ve talked about how maybe I just need to work on building more intimacy in other relationships, and I think that’s true, but I’m also realizing that in the past, even when I’ve had a strong group of friends and a partner, I have still had FP’s and still craved their care specifically. It makes me feel really frustrated that I could potentially put in all of this work to create lots of other close, intimate relationships in my life but that I still might have an FP who I cling to as an anchor. I guess I’m wondering if anyone has learned how to feel fulfilled through other (non FP) relationships and if anyone had ever managed to get their FP relationships to be mild enough where it’s more manageable and you don’t have those periods of obsessing over them and wishing desperately to contact them all the time etc?"
How to deal with an fp. Please I am drowning,3,mkts4r,6,"Me and this dude have been on this ride for over a year. 

I am head over heels for this man. The last few months I finally accepted that he would never change his mind on being with me (he rejoined the military and moved away) after begging and pleading for months to just give it a try. I still thought about him but I didnt cry everyday anymore.

I saw him around Xmas when he visited. I was ok then, but he just visited again this weekend. He stayed at my house for 3 days. Idk why this time was different. The sex is the best either of us have ever had. He kept calling me baby and darling. Idk it was just the best time.

He left yesterday. And per usual, like he does everytime he visits he just goes off the radar. No more baby, no more messaging me. He usually answers when I text him but the convos don't last long. He leaves me on open alot.

I am just so fucking sad. Idk why he acts like were together and then just disappears. I know he likes me alot, he was pretty sad when he had to move. But i have it stuck in my head that I can convince him to just try to be with me. I just want to try, but I know he won't. Im obsessed.

Im drinking again and crying all day. I dont want to feel like this but God I think I love this guy. How do I get it to stop? I dont want to cut him off because I dont want him out of my life."
Am I just stupid,1,ml11dk,8,I need to know if I'm just stupid of if my boyfriend and I just aren't meant to be. We have opposite views on a lot of thing. One big one that is causing huge fights is that he thinks I can't talk to other boys because he thinks ill cheat. I think I should be able to talk to whoever as long as its just friendly conversation. But I don't know if I'm just being stupid. Like I can't have a fulfilling relationship and get to talk to whoever I want.
Being open about your mental illness is a bad idea?,17,mkhnjf,14,"hey folks,

I'm 21 with bpd.

I'm not sure how stuff works in the ""progressive West"", but in Eastern-Europe mentally ill people are still heavily stigmatized (especially if you live in the even less progressive country and not in a big city).

I have my diagnosis since I was 18 and I started taking meds around that time too (still on them). even tho I'm trying to be a real person and not just a bunch of symptoms, there are still times in life when someone asks you a question or you talk about something with someone and your honest answer/response would be ""yeah I couldn't make it, I was hospitalized because I wanted to die that time"" but instead I just say some bullsh- like ""oh I don't really remember"" or something like that. and I always feel bad because I'm lying and because I'm ashamed of myself.

I mean it's not like a huge problem but tbh after years it's really-REALLY tiring and awkward. even in my family it's like a taboo or something, my close family members know about the issues I had but that's all. I mean I don't want to talk about it all the time or anything like that, but I just don't want to lie all the time or act like my mental problems are non existent.

and when I think about my future, I can't really imagine that this problem will solve itself. moreover, getting older and getting to know more and more people just forces me to lie more over time.

people talk about their (and even their family members', friends'!!) health issues like it's a daily thing, but whenever mental health, suicide, depression comes up, it's just... awkward silence.

my question is... do you think being honest about these things could make me end up in a bad place? I don't want to brag about it, I don't want to talk about it all the time, I just want to answer questions honestly and not make up stories..."
Am I the only one who feels this way?,49,mkd63s,14,"I absolutely hate it when I’m feeling horrible and someone says “I get like that too” or “same.” I don’t know why but it makes me so furious, especially with people who don’t suffer from mental illness let alone BPD. I don’t know if it’s because I feel to the extremes and I don’t believe they know what it’s like. I don’t show that I’m upset because I feel like they don’t deserve that. I just keep it in. Am I being irrational? Am I the only one who feels this way?"
Thinking about my former FP alot.,1,ml0hqt,1,"I think about her almost every day. I just recently got my diagnosis, and it feels so fucked up. I just look back and see everywhere it went wrong. I can see everytime I split on her and caused her pain. I just wish there was a way to make it up to her, but not everything has a happy ending. Its the complete lack of control and abilty to deal with my emotions that really bothers me when I think about it. I miss her, but I know she hates me. I genuinely dont know where im going with this, I just needed to get it out."
New therapist. Only concerned with payment,0,ml0gw6,3,"So I went to a therapist today because my psychiatrist recommended her. She emailed me leading up to it that I needed to figure out my copay and deductible. No big deal.. I did. We got on the zoom and she said, so I’m going to tell you about myself, you’re going to tell me why you’re here, and then we’ll deal with payment. 

She seemed nice, but fuck.. payment seemed to be the number one goal. Am I crazy to think she’s just money hungry?"
I feel so socially isolated. I want to see others on here can relate to this,4,mkozl5,7,"I'm a single guy, have no close friends except one that is far away and can only keep in touch over the internet. At times I question whether it is even possible that one day I might not be alone. It's barely possible to keep motivated enough as to be able to work. My BPD has robbed me of life, my dreams, chance of a family of my own. I don't know how long I'd be able to keep going."
Overthinking,2,mkvn8c,5,"My bf said they were gonna buy something the size up (something that makes them really happy and feel good) the next time they buy it and I literally just responded with ''okie!! They would both look so good!!''

Then said ''hopefully this one comes sooner!!''

I'm so insensitive and horrible I deserve to die.


Please someone help, was this bad and horrible of me???"
I feel like I only exist when I'm seen/heard,3,mkrxqk,0,"This sounds crazy but I've had times where I've believed I've died and I'm just a ghost and like people's interactions only happened if I made an effort to feel seen and it left everyone uncomfortable...like I'm haunting them 

I'm alone a lot. I almost prefer it alone. I don't have an fp but I find myself easily attached to any slither of kindness but otherwise I stay by myself 

Whenever I'm alone...it can feel like I'm not 'real' or I'm not a person or I'm nothing 

When I'm finally seen and recognised by someone I feel real again. Their view of me is alive therefore I am

And when they go I'm gone again. It's like object permanence, once I leave the room or we stop chatting online, I cease living/existing. Just everything about me is gone 

Sometimes someone will say how they thought of me the other day or if someone gets me a present and I'm just like ""wait you had to have thought of me.."" And of course they do, people will think if those around them but it feels like such a mind fuck 

I'm just not really feeling real right now...which I know is crazy but yeah...I don't know"
Wish I had someone who loved me,23,mkfdzz,5,"I know a relationship won’t solve my mental illnesses and issues, but I wish I had someone who loved me. Someone who loved me during the honeymoon phase and after. Someone who loved that I mirrored them and still did during times when I didn’t. Someone who loved me for the messy and complicated and traumatized person that I am. I’m not sure it will ever happen for me."
Impulsivity question,2,mku9rg,4,Has anyone here tried to take an antipsychotic in the medicine regimen and found that it made you more impulsive? I’ve tried abilify (2 mg and 5mg ) and seroquel (75mg) and I have had similar reactions w both. I also want to add that I don’t have much impulsivity problems off these meds. Just looking to see if anyone has had a similar experience
DAE Adopt Habits from Others Because You Don't Have An Identity/Sense of Self?,37,mkco87,9,"I have noticed myself doing this a lot lately. I've been adopting some habits or personality traits from characters on TV shows, people I watch on YouTube frequently, etc. It's not always just the good habits, either. I was just curiousif anyone else did this. I'm not sure if it's to help make up for my feeling hollow and legitimately have no sense of self. I feel so empty when I look in the mirror. The dissociation lately has been intense."
empathy,4,mkmylv,3,"i feel like my concept of empathy is very?? messed up?? i’ve always had a hard time understanding other people’s feelings, since i was a kid (and i used to be pretty violent as a kid) and when i got older and went through therapy it was easier but i’ve just realized i’ve kinda hit a peak?? and i was watching this Bojack Horseman thing and didn’t think i was like him until i realized i’m the same way he is with apologies. i don’t generally feel bad for things i’ve done, and when i do, it’s more like i just want to get rid of the feeling rather than actually make amends. and im realizing that’s what’s ruined a few friendships of mine. if i don’t feel it, how can i fake it? to preserve friendships and to make relationships that i have to deal with easier?"
Friendships,1,mkxzen,1,"Hi guy's,

Just wondering if anyone else experience this. I get really obsessed with my friends and if they even are like ten min late cause there doing something  for someone else I get so angry and jealous and feel like they hate me. I find it hard to control my  jealousy  with them"
I broke up with toxic bf...why am I still hoping he texts or calls?,5,mkma2y,1,"So I broke up with him after 8 months of hell...I'm so friggin proud of myself and I know it was the right thing to do. It's been 2 days now and I haven't reached out, haven't given into the urge to text or into feeling guilty, or the anxiety....I'm trying to distract myself and keep myself busy (thanks DBT)....

But there's this part of me that's hoping he'll call or text, and tell me he realizes he cares, that I 'matter', etc. Why!?!"
exhausted...idk...,3,mkpx23,1,"i don’t know how to go on with life, it’s just too hard and i don’t even know why since i don’t really have anything to complain about. but it just hurts so much. i wish i could talk to someone, but there’s noone. i have a lot of good friends, but everytime i open up about my problems i am downplaying how bad it is or how low i feel. like i want and try to show it, but i just can’t and sometimes even laugh it off.
i feel so lonely in an emotional way. i think about quiting life so often, but i am not even able to go that way because i feel too responsible for friends, family or the job i just started. i can’t go on like this neither i want to... but not even ending this all is an option. how do i deal with all this pain (when i don’t even know where it is coming from)? i am so exhausted and i wish for help so bad inside.
(i started therapy last year but then had to quit because of the new job and the work times, had to cancel my psych ward application and stopped my medication because every pill i tried made everything worse.)
i just wish i could go that last one step and get relief of life and it’s pain."
How to apologize and also ask for an apology?,2,mksp79,3,"This probably seems really obvious but I’m having a hard time with it at the moment. I’m hoping once I get off work I can sit and try and look through my workbook but I don’t recall seeing something to deal with this.

Last night I got into an “argument” with a friend over voice chat. I only put it in quotations bc it was very low stakes but we were both snippy with each other. 

I absolutely understand what I need to apologize for and I want to, but I don’t know how to do that and also bring up that I would potentially like an apology as well? I’m concerned that it will come across as trying to make the issue about me and my upset feelings, instead of trying to reach a mutual understanding. 

I don’t know, maybe I’m just in my head too much, but any advice would be appreciated."
how do I get better?,3,mkp04q,1,"I ruined my relationship because my moods flip so much, and he doesn’t know how to handle it anymore. I want to change for the better I want to stop assuming and acting out and being dramatic. I want to change please help me. I want to learn how to control my emotions better."
I think I’m a masochist,4,mkkot5,2,I think masochism and bpd can go hand in hand sometimes. It’s almost like I get a kick out of driving the knife in my pain and other peoples but of course I don’t actually. It’s like my self-hatred is brought up in my subconscious and leaks out wether I like it or not.
i can’t imagine being loved,77,mk6jpv,13,"i can’t even comprehend it. every time someone tries to get close to me i stop things from becoming serious. 
when someone says they care about me, this inner monologue starts in my head where i tell myself they’re lying to me or they’re mocking me or they’re kidding themselves and just don’t know any better. i think they’ll change their mind so i should put a stop to it before i get hurt. i’ve been doing it since i was 12 years old. 
i can’t even explain it. i literally can not even imagine being loved for who i am. i can’t imagine someone caring about me because they want to and not because their life sucks or they have no friends or because i’ve tricked them. 
i can’t imagine someone knowing who i am and still loving me. i get attached to people i know i can’t have so i can blame them not loving me on things like distance or circumstances. i’m so afraid of being vulnerable. it makes me feel like i could die. 
i’ve never not regretted it. i’m so tired of being this way but i just can’t rewire my brain and thinking. 
i tell myself i should be with people who i don’t love so it won’t hurt when they hurt me or leave me or cheat on me or die."
I feel like i’m wasting my life before my eyes,3,mknt2v,11,"It’s been almost 3 years since I started showing severe symptoms, and i guess i thought i would be on the road to recovery by now. I have a strong urge to get better and get my self-confidence back, but the emotional part of me doesn’t want to get better. This disorder forces me to repeatedly do things that make my condition worse. 

but my main point here is that i’m tired of feeling like my life is being wasted. i’m only 20 years old but i feel like i’ll be in the same place until i’m 30. i look back over the last few years and can’t remember many positive experiences. just crying, crying, punching, condemning, hitting, and guilt. that’s my life. your 20s are supposed to be the most fun and exciting time in your life. i have a feeling i’ll look back and say “wow, my 20s sucked and i had no self confidence for years”. i’m ready for fun and adventure. my mind and body feel overdue."
does anybody else get mad when someone says they cant hang out even though you know you wouldnt enjoy it anyway,9,mkgsna,1,"like i asked my friend if they wanted to hang out because why tf not and they were like ""i cant"". and even though i knew id rather die than be with someone at that time i got annoyed anyway. like super annoyed. didnt wanna talk with that person anymore cause i was like uagaghh just say you hate me then

is this a bpd thing or not lmao"
I haven’t missed anyone,3,mknesm,1,"Things are recovering from the pandemic since people are being vaccinated. I’m seeing a lot of posts online about how they can’t wait to hug their grandma or see family and friends again. 

I ....dread seeing people again. I have literally no one except my boyfriend. My grandparents are dead and they didn’t really like me much when they were alive. I have a pretty bad relationship with everyone else in my family and haven’t seen any of them in years. We might text once in a while but none of them ever EVER say they miss me or love me. 

I have no friends. I mean, I have some online friends and an old friend I used to hang out with but THINGS happened and our friendship will never be the same. She “checked in” with me online a little while ago and we messaged back and forth, but she promptly stopped responding (you know the old “I’ve been sick but I will reply soon” and then just never replies).

My bf’s family used to get together for everything, AND every month. I used to like it but started to realize they didn’t actually care if I was there or not. And at one point I was told I need to clean the kitchen since I don’t contribute to the meal (this is a whole other can of worms - there’s always a reason when I do something, or not). So it made me feel like scum and basically I am just there to clean up after them. 

I don’t want to go back to doing these things. I feel alone in a room full of people. Nobody talks to me, and no I’m not the outgoing type who can “just talk to them!” I basically shut down in these situations. I don’t even feel like myself. But yeah it’s been over a year and I just dread having to go back to “get-togethers.” Anyone else ??"
How to stop feeling like I'm unstable/losing my mind constantly?,2,mkq4zy,1,"I constantly feel like I'm on unstable ground or going insane. I left my abusive house and am living with my husband. He doesn't have bpd and I feel guilty but i just feel so unstable. Randomly yesterday I disconnected and attempted to get on a highway by foot. He literally had to grab me and ask if I was seriously gonna do that. I lied obviously but i just want to be a good wife and partner and I don't know how. 

And these thoughts get so bad that sometimes I just want to silence them but obviously I can't because I have him and others I guess. Is there anyway I can improve and feel more stable so I can be a good partner to him? We have no kids. Married for a year. I don't want kids. Not with how I am."
DAE bang their head against a wall when raging?,2,mkq3se,5,"Hi all! I was diagnosed with BPD a few years back. I had a very bad weekend this past weekend and my husband (42M) and I (45F) said and did things we now regret. We almost got to the point of me leaving and talking about divorce, which is bad since I am from the East Coast but my husband and I are living in Cancun, Mexico. We are now working through it but there is that unsettled “weirdness” now. My emotions before my “time of the month” is very emotional and I don’t know how to control it. 

Yesterday, during one of my outbursts (I normally do this when I get really bad), I blacked out and banged my head on the table a few times and have a huge bruise and cut on my forehead. I do it often and somehow I usually bang my head in the same place every time. Does anyone have any coping skills to help me or my husband deal with this so it doesn’t continue? I blackout and don’t know I’m doing it and never remember that I do it until I’m calm again, and it starts to hurt. That’s when my husband tells me what happened. 

I feel terrible for my husband because he says that when I’m about to bang my head, I’m like a robot. I don’t walk right in those moments, I walk like a robot and make sharp turns and go over to something and just bang my head 3 times and then just stand there (a couple times he said I held my head and said “get out of my head” to myself). He’s been researching BPD since we found out my diagnosis and how to help me and also doing a lot of therapy on his own along with marriage counseling together. He has anxiety issues (which was going okay until he met me and has since resurfaced) and PTSD because of my disorder. 

Is there any insight someone could give me as to how to help us or any tips that would help us? I am doing CBT everyday and working my butt off to be a better wife and also a better person in general. I just have a lot of setbacks and it’s very discouraging for me and my husband. He’s an amazing man and I don’t want to lose the love of my life/soulmate. Thank you in advance! Stay safe and strong, my friends!"
absolute nothingness,6,mkmyx6,1,"all i wish for right now. to make it hurt less and to stop waking up to cry and roll around hoping to turn into dust. 

lots of emotional support have been given during the last few days by close ones and people that know about my situation. it's one of those breakup things you know. it just happened at the worst possible fucking time. 

it was a strange feeling to feel actually good and hopeful of things to come. everything was in shape. then suddenly i lost a huge part of my life and can't stay in this city anymore. it was her decision and i respect it. she was my best friend, my  favorite person, whom i learned so much from. every day is a struggle knowing that she isn't there anymore. 

staying sober is exceptionally hard. yet i know that drinking won't help and no amount of soaking in booze will bring her back. nothing will."
I have a new FP now and he knows about my BPD.,2,mkptdd,0,"This new FP is my childhood friend and I've known him for 12 fucking years. He knows about my disorder and how it's affected me for years and that still affects me every single day. In fact, he even rooted for me the whole time I was got officially diagnosed. 

I've had a long string of Favorite Persons throughout my life and almost every single one of them were people who weren't healthy. If they weren't an alcoholic, broken, or suicidal too, they'd have some other issue. But this FP is a really good guy and he means the world to me. I've loved him even before he was my FP but now I just love him even more. *And I'm terrified.*

It's been really chaotic the last few days and I've been getting worse because of the last FP I lost two months ago (that I had to mourn over *twice*) and my new FP being someone who I really never wanted to be my FP ever. We both agreed on this; as I've explained to him what having an FP felt and looked like and that he's seen my relationships die in a chaotic hurt-filled fury every single time—which is why it distressed me more. 

However! In the midst of the chaos, we talked it out and he told me that we would do our best if he were to ever become my FP. He is officially my FP now. I am still yet to tell him.

So, in essence, I would love to hear all the inputs on trying to keep a relationship because I 've never kept a single one in my life and I don't want him to suffer the same way all the ones before him did. But he's willing to work with me. He's willing to learn and he's never failed at always being very supportive of me. 

I love this man, he's actually healthy and a generally good person. I don't want him to be like everyone else despite my BPD thinking that he still won't be an exception and will leave me too. And I can't imagine living through another devastation that'll be the worst than anything else. 

But I know it's possible. I've seen people have healthy relationships with their FP. It's real even if it feels fucking impossible. I have a therapist, and seeing an LPC on top of that. I might get medicated soon too (yay). And I'm trying really hard but it's *really fucking hard.* I know I say it every time, but I just want things to be different so tremendously terribly. I have so much love for him. If only I could do the same for myself.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I have a new FP who's my childhood friend and I want all the advice for keeping a relationship and advice on how he can be a good FP too. He'll most likely be on this sub soon so we can welcome him hehe. Thank you so much. You guys have all my love<3"
Who am I supposed to tell my psychiatrist that I think I have BDP,1,mkuube,3,"I'm seeing my psychiatrist tomorrow. I don't know how to tell him that I think I have BPD. 
I think I'll say that an other psychiatrist say that I have dissociative (it's real) but I don't know how to start ?
Maybe saying to him that my actual medecine isn't working (paroxetine for my depression)
He's a bit old and rude, I'm scared that he said I'm not BDP because I'm almost 100% sure I have.
I'm studying psychology so I know (a bit) of the DSM V."
If I’m not the actions I regret then what am I,4,mkki4k,0,"It’s like I always ignore the voice in my head that I should be listening to. I am trying to be more aware and listen to it but I still ignore it 85% of the time. I say or do stupid things and am fully aware that I shouldn’t say the stupid thing but it’s really hard not to. I end up ruminating and beating myself up over these mistakes and I feel like if people knew how I actually felt they wouldn’t hate me as much. I guess my question is am I the asshole things I say if I feel like they aren’t a representation of me or are they who I am and I’m just in denial about what a jerk I am. 

I hate myself so much and I always justify my actions by thinking “I hate me more than anyone else” but this way of thinking isn’t solving any of my problems."
Think I might have BPD according to my sister who’s a Psychiatrist.. Do you suggest I still get an official diagnosis somewhere?,1,mkuglt,3,"I was sexually abused as a child at ages 5-7 by my neighbor and have never told anyone except for my sister, I’ve had an eating disorder all my life (only 100 pounds & 5’5 right now but have absolutely no plans to change my ways..my eating disorder has been prevalent for about 7 years) and lastly all of my relationships last about one year; I end up completely ghosting relationships due to the fact I truly believed they never liked me and were going to leave anyway. 

I either love or hate someone and there’s really no in between. People who are status driven and somewhat narcissistic gravitate to me. 

I don’t know why but especially narcissistic men are very attracted to me until I lash out due to fear of abandonment (I’ve been cheated on in every real relationship I’ve been in). I didn’t do everything right in those relationships but my family says I choose toxic men but I’m not sure if it’s just me causing these problems. 

Let’s just say I’ve burned every bridge there is and currently I just did that with someone and I think I might need to seek treatment. I don’t know how things can change for me but has anyone had any success in therapy? 

(What’s weird is I’ve been to two therapists who’ve told me I definitely don’t have BPD but I’m extremely naive with people who are basically abusers/I should’ve seen the red flags)."
Sex life and promiscuity as a coping mechanism,4,mkkf02,3,"Im a man in my 30s now and i have always been very promiscuous with other men ever since i can reach my memory. I started having an active sex life at some point between the age of 14 and 15. I was always mainly doing short term relationships that as u may guess have always been very intense and dramatic. At the age of about 19 i stopped counting the men i was sleeping with as i reached a 300 and decided no point keeping check of that. 
6 years ago i met my current husband. Im not gonna get into why and how but all im gonna say we are soulmates on a soul level but we do not have any form of sex. We just dont. 
My symptoms ever since have gone up big time, as i no longer can practice my usual “coping mechanism” which is sleeping around. As a matter of fact it wasnt even the sole sleeping around that was my thing, it was more of a fact that it was a NEW guy. I hardly ever did the same guy more than twice. Again, it wasnt sex that got me hooked up, it was the NEW MAN card that kept my engine going. 
Anyway long story short i have always been faithful in all my short term relationships and so i am in this long term one. 
Circling back to my earlier point, being in this monogamous relationship deprived me of my main and favorite coping mechanism. 
So i started overspending. Like hugely. 
But thats not what i wanna talk about. 
Tell me how long can one go without sex (6 years for me now) and how scared would u be u eventually would cheat?"
Not diagnosed with bpd but looking for someone who might relate? Splitting??,1,mkufsz,0,"So the start off, I am not diagnosed with bpd, and idk if I have it. I am currently diagnosed with anxiety, depression, ocd, tourettes, adhd, and ptsd. So no, I don't have BPD but I'm posting here because I've been experiencing something that from my understanding is a common experience in bpd, called splitting? At least I feel like that's what this is, I apologize if I'm misunderstanding what this really is. This is something that happens a lot but I guess I'm going to specifically talk about the last 24 hours that it's happened.

Pretty much the last couple days I have been head over heels for my boyfriend, I mean I always am but it's all I could think about was how much I loved him, how wonderful he is and wanting to tell him all the time how much I did, but then today something happened that really is seemingly insignificant but it was felt really hurtful and upsetting to me and immediately all I feel is resentment and a sort of bitterness toward him feeling like he only cares about himself and he doesn't care about me and I'm always there for him and he's never there for my type of shit, tho I feel like I know that's not true. But that the thing, I know this is illogical, I know that's it's ridiculously for my feelings to switch so intensely like that so quickly and I know by the end of the day or at least in a couple I'll be completely bad to thinking about how wonderful he is, and he really really is wonderful and I know that, but this happens, a lot more than I want it to and a lot more than I feel like is okay for it to be happening. So regardless of bpd, cause I can't say this is a symptom of that, for me cause idk if that's what I'm dealing with but I figured other people here might relate and might be able to share their experience with these kinds of feelings and what sort of triggers it I guess. I mean I suppose I know what triggers it but idk why it does. If that makes sense?"
"Experiences with guilt, particularly after an episode of splitting or meltdown?",2,mkoxs7,7,"Just wondering how u guys deal with guilt? Guilt is an emotion I feel all the time, excessively and about various things, and often when it isn’t even my fault. I am not sure whether it is actually a BPD thing or more of just a GAD thing, because I have both. 

I’ve been in therapy for a little while now and guilt is one of the main things we go over, and it crops up again and again. I think for me it results from trauma and manipulation, so I feel overly guilty all the time. However, when I have a BPD meltdown and act out I can hurt people. For example, splitting on my boyfriend. I then deal with the guilt from that for so long. Was just wondering if anyone else has this issue, particularly after splitting or a meltdown and how u deal with it."
Fml,6,mkgz8s,5,"Im a nursing student, left-handed, and i have an exam in 30 min and my friend insisted on practicing on me and i didn’t know how to lie on the spot. She wanted to try an exam that involved measuring my pulse on my right arm and i asked her to do it in my left arm and she said she wanted to practice it on my right since that’s how we’ll do it on the patient and i freaked out and it was so obvious and in the end i asked her to try it with my sleeve not rolled up and it showed that she realized why i didn’t want her to. 

This happened in front of another friend that’s known for having a big mouth so now im in the bathroom having a panic attack because i feel like now everyone will know about my SH and i cant breathe. I’ve been able to hide it for 8-9 years why Now is it biting me in the ass i cant breathe i don’t live somewhere that is understanding of mental illness when my sister saw an old scar a while ago i asked her to gtfo of my room and she said “why, you wouldnt have done it if you didnt want people to see” and this is the only thing playing in my head right now idk how i am going into the exam"
I am so tired,92,mk35ou,10,"Everytime someone doesn't respond to a message: they hate me. I know I've jumped to this conclusion a million times, but this time it feels like they definitely do hate me.

Everyone just dreads hearing from me. I don't blame them. I tend to come off really strong, or so aloof you don't even know I exist.

My therapist didn't respond the way I wanted. Well, now I hate her and regret saying anything to her.

Oh, a random good day? I guess I lied and faked all those bad days. Why am I even in therapy? I can just have more days like this. Easy.

My friend who's given me so much freaking support just made a dumb joke at my expense. What a total asshole. Guess I have to block him. I knew he hated me.

Oops, I messed up and said something insensitive to another friend. I'm pretty much the worst person in the world. I better avoid them now. They shouldn't have to put up with me. Time to spiral so hard the room spins."
Feelings for someone I literally saw one time,3,mklomj,1,Last night I hung out with an old friend of mine from middle school. We used to be inseparable and then we mutually grew apart as our interests differed as we got a bit older. We’re both in our 20’s now and both suffer from BPD. Last night we hung out and rly hit it off and I think I have a crush on her which can’t happen for multiple reasons. Why do our brains do this? Why am I fantasizing about a relationship & future with this girl lol
I’m sorry to all those I’ve hurt in ways that were hurtful and were damaging-,320,mjvcs4,30,"I was unaware that I was mindlessly reacting to my impulses and insecurities that I projected towards you & all of you. 

They say “Hurt people hurt people,” and I can’t believe I became that hurtful person that hurt you. All I wanted was for you to love me.

But I didn’t know the myths and assumptions I had about your lack of love was just my insecurities and lack of self-love.

I now know that you truly cared and loved.. but you didn’t know how to care for someone that had BPD and someone who was so lost and stuck in a dark place. 

I’m trying to move on and I’m trying my best not to project unto others my inabilities to self-regulate; self-soothe and self-love. 

I’m trying to be more effective in asking for support and help that doesn’t cross boundaries.

I’m still lost and afraid yet this adult that feels like a child navigating this world is owning up to her past wrongs. 

I reflect on our good memories & I radically accept this moment even though it isn’t what I want it to be.

I ask for your forgiveness even though you might never talk to me again- but I wish more importantly your happiness because you deserve everything good in this world. 

I’m sorry. I really am. 

And thank you for what was once.

Dear me,

Set yourself free. 
Love yourself because it’s time to take care of yourself- the way you wished others would :’)

Be the best friend you never had.
It is never too late.

how the hell do you handle living on your own?,7,mkgcfd,0,"23F with BPD, suspected ADHD, anxiety and depression over here 🙋🏻‍♀️

as time goes on I’m slowly realising I suck at being on my own. I can’t handle my own company. my thoughts run rampant when I’m alone. 

I was with my ex boyfriend from the age of 15 to 21. he was emotionally abusive, manipulative and cheated on me 3 years into our relationship. I stayed with him and for 2.5 years I pretty much hated him and felt single but was too scared to leave. when I was 19 during that time I was kicked out of my mum’s house and moved in with my grandparents for two years. I broke up with my ex and I was living on my own for about a year between 21-22. I had started talking to my new boyfriend right after the breakup with my ex because it felt like I was emotionally done with my previous relationship for so long that I felt I didn’t need time to heal. he just walked in to my life at a time that I needed a positive influence, and he was/is amazing. 

I then moved in with my boyfriend of 8 months at the time (and his family) because I hated living on my own, was mostly at his place anyway and our relationship was in a great place. 

fast forward to now just over a year later and his mum kicked me out for the frequent arguments my bf and I were having, plus she was getting involved in our relationship. we are still together but I am staying with my grandparents feeling like I don’t have a fucking home and feel more mentally ill than ever. I’m currently looking for a rental, and my boyfriend has some hesitations about signing a lease together right now because we have been arguing for literally 6 months now - so I don’t blame him. he wants to see how our relationship goes with a bit of breathing space and hopefully we rekindle and he is confident enough to move out with me in the near future. I love him dearly and want our relationship to work, and would rather have him in my life than not at all. 

I feel like I genuinely despise being alone. right now it feels like I’m homeless with just an empty house to stay in temporarily, my grandparents are never here and will be selling this home in 2-3 months. finding a rental is hard. I know I’ll feel better when I have somewhere to call “home”, but even then I have my reservations that I’ll still hate it. what do I do? how do I learn to love my own company? how do I not put a bunch of expectations on my partner to be with me 24/7? I need help. I go to therapy and I’m medicated but it doesn’t feel like enough."
Intrusive thoughts are suffocating.,3,mkkl14,3,"Early today I was playing dead by daylight with my friends. It was just us 4 and one of them said something to do with me and my boyfriend. I can't remember what exactly but it seemed to be hinting at us not being close anymore or into eachother anymore. 

(For context - me and my bf have had opposite sleep schedules for a while now, so most of the time I'm asleep during the day, while he's asleep during the night. We admittedly haven't spent much time together. My previous job was the reason but I recently got fired from it. Another note is we both have the same friend group.)

When I first heard it I tried to ignore it. I did for a little but then it started to pick away at me. ""What if they're right?"", ""What if he stopped liking me?"", ""What if he leaves me?"". I quickly tried to distract myself so that my thoughts don't get worse, but it still would randomly cram itself into my mind here and there. I eventually got tired and went to have a shower before bed, but that feels like the worst thing I could of done. 

In the shower my thought immediately start flooding. ""He's going to leave me"", ""he hates me"", ""I've done nothing with my life so we wouldn't be able to have a future together"", ""we won't work out because I'm useless"", ""I'm a failure and he knows it"", ""he's just pitying me and doesn't know how to leave me"". It just kept spiraling. I started thinking about us being moved in together and me continuesly being fired from jobs (I've been fired from 2 recently) and me just bothering him with my mental problems or him just being annoyed with me. Then I imagined the thought of him giving up on me and telling me to move out. Me packing my bags and finding somewhere to end my life. At this point I'm crying in the shower over something that hasn't happened, and I didn't realise it until I snapped out of my thought. All the emotions from these thoughts just ache and are so prominent that I can barely function.

I don't know how to handle these scenarios that run though my head. I feel like I'm living in them and that they're real and very much happening. I'm too afraid to talk to anyone about it because I complain too much already about things that upset me or paranoia I get. I don't want to drive people away with my emotional unhinged states. I know people get sick of me venting to them but at the same time I need help and support. Is that manipulative of me? I don't know what to think anymore. I don't want to feel this way, I don't want to think this way, I hate how my mood can be fine then shifts into despair in a single trigger.

I feel really hopeless and that there's no way to help me."
Bitterly envious of others and their lives.,20,mkayfh,6,"I'm now 26 years old, and for the first time, I am becoming extremely bitter toward others. Every time my cousin or my sister send me pictures of their outings, or I see a post about a past friend with their friends, doing things in the world, I feel envy. My thoughts are like: *They have a life and I don't. They have friends, or an SO to talk to at the end of the day, and I don't.*

A single mother. Friendless. Living in low income housing. My only hobbies include YouTube, video games if I have the energy, and heavy drinking (which makes everything worse). I have nothing to show for my life but work, two children I have for half the month, and twenty pounds that I've gained from a binge eating habit. I fucking hate myself.

I am extremely envious of my beautiful cousin and my outgoing sister. They have plenty of their own struggles, but they also have other friends. They have a family. I am so fucking lonely."
Using People For Dopamine,6,mkhgiu,0,"I kind of feel like I should feel like an asshole. I've been seeing someone for some months now, beginning as fuck buddies but now they've caught at least a few feelings. We haven't talked about it, though they occasionally say they like me or whatever, but also qualify that they don't mean it super seriously (I'm paraphrasing, a bit).

I feel nothing. I don't frequently feel anything outside of obsession or disdain for people and I feel neither for them. I'm more depressed than normal, so I'm closer to disdain most days. But I do get dopamine when we have sex and occasionally when we cuddle.

It's nice, having someone around at times. I would never make myself vulnerable to them or confide in them, though, so it simultaneously is just as frustrating as everyone else I interact with. Minus the good moments, I spend a lot of the time with them feeling tired and like I don't want to exist."
He left me,13,mkd4db,4,"The love of my life left me, I feel
So empty and I cried a lot at work today, he loved me and knew me Better then anyone else did and he said it and knew It, I feel horrible I wish I was better but I was the toxic one I was the horrible one I hurt the person that loved me the most in the whole world I’m horrible"
I’m having trouble in my relationship.,5,mkidz1,0,I’m having trouble telling my s/o on how to better handle me when I’m in crisis mode and just a better way to respond and handle me in the first place and I feel like he’s not really making an effort but I also feel like I’m being too demanding of him like by asking him to be nicer about asking me of things even when he’s frustrated or just responding to me different because it makes me insecure the way he responds to me.
My FP and I confessed we have feelings for each other after a long time. But he has revealed that he has feelings for someone else too and I feel BROKEN.,7,mkfo08,1,"cw // self harm, suicidal thoughts

this is heartbreaking. my fp admitted he has feelings for me and he always has, but while trying to get over me, he started liking someone else. and he still has feelings for this person. he still likes me as well. 

i don’t have feelings for anyone else.

i feel so broken.

the past few days we were flirting with each other and i felt so secure and happy about our relationship, I NEVER FELT SO STABLE BEFORE. and now? it’s all fallen apart. i love him the most as a friend of course, but this is so painful i literally feel like dying and i hate myself for it. 

i have really important final exams coming up, but i can’t focus on anything, THIS IS ALL I AM THINKING ABOUT CONSTANTLY. i feel dead inside. i want to self harm. i want to do something. 

man i hit my head against a wall until it started bleeding because i just wanted to feel something else other than this heartbreak. i’m so exhausted. things never work out. and i can’t help but feel like its all my fault. i am the problem. maybe i am the terrible person and that’s why things never work out for me.

he said he’ll think about whether or not he can have a relationship with me and i said the same thing.. but is that even fair? if he has feelings for someone else, is it fair to me to be in a relationship with him? i know i should have some self respect and say if he has feelings for someone else, he shouldn’t be with me. but i can’t help myself. i almost don’t care. i just want to be with him. 

in the end i think the best thing to do is sort this out after our final exams but this is consuming me so much. i don’t know how to pull myself together."
sorry,1,mkrlic,0,I’m sorry for my last post I really was in a bad place I was just extremely angry. I wanted him to like me so bad I just wanted him to want me. I’m so pathetic I don’t even like this person. I just want to prove to myself that I can do this that I can make him love me. I just want someone anyone to love me. I want to d word. I haven’t eaten in a while I’m crying and angry. All I’ve been doing is obsessively watching plastic surgery and weightloss videos. I can’t do this. I have to do everything in my power to be loved. I don’t even see this person as person anymore but a challenge to be won.
I lost my FP - Cant stop crying.,4,mkgm9p,3,"Hey guys, I lost my FP 2 days ago whom I have known over a year and have been close with since 5 months. 
We got to know each other over the internet and we spend every day together. Talking, face caming,, gaming, watching videos and so on. We even planned on seeing each other irl soon. Now..he is gone. He does not want to cope with me anymore. I knew that I haf BPD traits and already lost people because of it. 
That is why I warned him beforehand and told him my triggers and that it would be best to always communicate if there was something wrong. Thats the healthier way is it not?  Since I told him that he read stuff about BPD in the internet..how they should keep their distance from us and what sick monsters we are. This hurt me so much hearing that from him.
We had really good times and he became my FP really fast. I would go as far as saying that I caught feelings for him. I never wished him bad or anything. 
Now he pointed put angrily how high maintenance I am..how demanding and attention seeking. 
He said he understands why people start to ignore me at some point. That broke my heart really.
I mean..thinking about it from his point of view..and the fact that he wasnt as invested in me than I was in him..I can understand it. I do..and I hate myself again. Because this cycle keeps repeating and I never seem to learn.
He means so much to me and losing him so sudden makes my heart explode. I cant stop crying and I wished I could turn back time. Im so helpless because even explaining why I behaved the way I did didnt help. I told him..that if he was happier without me I would stay away. 
Im devastated..I feel so unworthy of love and life.
I feel like I am a burden to everyone and that I am a mistake.
I really miss him and cant understand that I am so meaningless to him that he wouldnt sit down with me and talk it out. 
What can I do to make it hurt less? I already apologized to him. I just wish he would tell me that he still likes me."
im at my breaking point. please help.,2,mklnbn,0,"after a very hard 2 and a half year relationship with my bf, who has never been ready to be in a relationship but forced himself to be with me because of how much he loved me, we have decided to just be friends indefinitely. i knew this was coming, it’s been a long time coming, but it hurts. i can’t imagine myself with anyone other than him, and i know he feels the same. he has a lot going on mentally that he’s unable to get help for right now and because of that he feels like he can’t be in a relationship. it has nothing to do with me or how much he loves me, because he really does love me and said he’s never going to get over me and if it was up to him we’d be ok and happy right now, but he can’t mentally handle it. he’s my soulmate and he’s absolutely everything to me. i know a lot of people go through stuff like this and eventually end up together years down the line but not being with him feels so wrong to me and on top of this, i’m moving out in august to go to college and so is he and we’re potentially going to be 4 hours away from each other and my parents are moving out of my childhood home and going to basically the middle of nowhere, so between me and him and all the changes happening in my life i feel like im suffocating. all i want is to be with him and be happy but right now that’s not an option, it could be months from now but i don’t know how to be patient and the thought of not being with him makes me feel physically sick and i don’t know what to do. i don’t think i’ll be ok until me and him are back together and happy. we’ve been better than we have in awhile since just being friends, we’re texting all day every day again which we haven’t done in a long time and i know it took a lot of stress off of him so i feel bad for even complaining, but i know i’ll never be happy unless we get back together. i know there’s a good chance of that happening but it’s gonna take awhile. i have such an extreme amount of anxiety and i just want him, and on top of this, im also dealing with 2 diagnosed anxiety disorders, depression, borderline personality disorder, and a possible eating disorder. he’s the only thing that made any of those better. please help. i feel like im at my breaking point."
Psychedelics while boderline ?,7,mkefk2,14,"Has anyone here tried psychedelics , and if so what were they and how do you feel ? I watched a video recently and the person was saying never to do psychedelics with someone who’s bpd I guess because they were having a bad trip . I’m just curious because they always make it seem like everyone with a diagnosis is insane and we lack the ability to have profound spiritual experiences. 

Disclaimer: they say people with bpd shouldn’t do psychs . but I think spiritually it can be a special trait and our western medicine just wants to point fingers at the people who are wired differently , and say something is wrong with people who think differently. 
I’m not encouraging anyone to try psychedelics but I just want to hear others experiences first hand . Rather then some jerk on YouTube . Lol 
And I’m aware of the warnings to stay away from it but I’ve done a lot of work , therapy , mediations etc along this journey into psychedelics.  

If anyone is curious about my specific experiences I’ll share soon maybe ."
Progress feels almost more painful,13,mkc8sy,2,"It’s so hard living like this. So much positivity and fulfillment when you’ve made so much improvement. Joy in progress. Joy in committing to a cause to not only improve your life, but the lives of others. Then, when you backtrack - i.e. f*ck up - the gravity of the fall is like an incremental pile of bricks. 

Over and over this cycle continues. The pain is brutal. It’s almost worse getting back on the horse. The good thing is, while it hurts more and more, it is progress nonetheless. 

Progress is not a straight line - it ebs and flows but so long as it's in the same trajectory, it's within reach. Carry on. Keep it up. Hopefully I am in the minority feeling this way. 

Just venting and looking for some empathetic/insightful discussion. Xo"
I fucked up another friendship,1,mkoo47,1,This guy was being really nice to me and I overdid it. He said he'd come pick me up so I wouldnt have to be alone and last night I spammed him with messages. He said to call after a nap so I called 5 times to wake him up. He lives an hour and a half away and I just thought he was so understanding that I would be honest and ask for some help. In reality its complicated but I just went overboard. He hasn't contacted me today and I feel really embarrassed and guilty I put so much pressure on him. I dont think he wants to talk to me again. Sent him a message to apologise and I really just want to know he doesn't hate me but I cant spam without making things worse. I dont know why I keep doing this but I'm so angry at myself. If I had just kept the boundaries I'd worked so hard to build in place this wouldn't have happened. If I hadn't been so desperate for help I wouldn't have relied on someone I barely know
I need advice,1,mkoiqj,2,"Basically, I'm feeling really bad about this and i would love some advice. I have BPD and my best friend does too. In the last 6 months she has made about 6 suicide attempts and everytime i'm the only one she tells about it. So I have had to drive her to the ER, talk with police officers or suicide hotlines and I called 911 twice to save her life. She says she's not angry with me but I hate doing that to her, the hospital only seems to worsen her mood. And I know how it feels to want to die, I feel bad because I'm forcing her to stay alive even if it isnt what she wants. But obviously I can't let her die if she tells me what she's doing.

Since she's been doing this once a month, it keeps me in a really dark mood and I'm trying so hard to stop self-harming (i'm a few months clean now!!) but she keeps telling me about her self harm and suicide ideation and it's so fucking difficult.

My boyfriend and my therapist keep telling me to stop taking care of her and leave it to someone else... I can't do that, i care so much about her and idk if she would tell anyone else if i'm not there during her suicide attempts. Our other friends have a good mental health and they're not confortable talking to her since they dont understand.

Thanks for reading, i would love to hear your opinion on my situation ❤️❤️"
I truly don’t even understand myself,8,mkcv5e,2,"It’s so frustrating living in a constant state of dissatisfaction.

I don’t know what a normal relationship is like. How do people without BPD act in a relationship? I’ve put up a show with my significant other and constantly smile and act like everything is normal so I can please them. For some reason, they can look right through it and feel the negativity. I don’t know what to do anymore.

It’s terrifying thinking about losing my significant other but at the same time I want to break up and run away.

This illness is exhausting."
"was cheating with guy, he ended things because HE was cheating",0,mkxq0u,4,"my relationship with partner is getting terrible and i'm cheating on him with others and then ""cheating"" on those others and lying about it all. i know i'm a horrible person. i've been very impulsive. and i don't really care how its affecting them. i met a guy yesterday and i tried to act like his girlfriend and we flirted and he said he wants to do things with me. i flirted with him in front of his friends and they said he has a gf! immediately after that he asked me to delete all our texts and distancing himself from me. i am obsessing about him. it hurts a lot like idc if hes cheating too but i was feeling so obsessed with him. i want to cry now. this is so stupid i miss him and i've known him for a day. i'm heart broken"
bpd books for relationships,1,mkn1ug,2,"i’m trying to help my boyfriend understand more about bpd and I find books to be the most beneficial. he has read i hate you don’t leave me, but i’m wondering if anyone can recommend books that are specifically aimed at people with bpd in relationships"
I've reached burnout,11,mkavk0,2,"I'm honestly just so drained by everything. Nothing excites me. Every day is the same. I feel like I have zero time to myself to just be me. Yet at the same time I feel so fucking lonely. I just want to crawl into bed with someone and receive endless cuddles and lovins until I'm recharged, but nope can't have that shit. 

I'm just exhausted. Life just feels so bleak and meaningless. Like a fucking mouse running in a wheel never going anywhere. Sure I got my own place, my own car, I got a job and I make money and I can live comfortably..but just..everything feels so meaningless. Like..this is it? This is life?"
Try at every moment to run away from a relationship,3,mkgdt0,5,"I have what some would describe as a very good “relationship”, and I use quotations because I in a way, refuse to be in a relationship with my S/O, however he does treat me the way that I think many people wish to be treated in a relationship. He is kind, caring, understanding, and loving, but in my mind I find him incredibly irritating... And he is quite the opposite of irritating. We are long distance and with that comes with the need to be patient and sometimes in the dark because we obviously can’t check on each other the way we normally could in person. This factor drives me completely insane. I know this is my illness doing the driving when I become this way but it’s as if I want him all the time, but when he’s finally free and able to spend time with me I become vile and incredibly hard to be around. It’s at these moments the autopilot takes over and I pick fights over things that have happened years ago, I become aggressive with things he doesn’t do such as replying faster, not paying attention to me in a conversation, etc... And then at the end of it all we end up canceling the movie night, and he ends up going to sleep and I end up being angry and holding on to that anger until I feel okay again (which varies day by day!) At many times throughout the years I have tried to get him to admit that he would be better off without me, and when he disagrees or doesn’t want to speak about it I again, go off on my temper tantrums. I know I am very toxic, and I’m trying to pinpoint my triggers but it’s a struggle and a battle every day with my mind. Im just wondering if it’s just me with this sort of issue... I’m feeling at a loss."
My mother finally got diagnosed,22,mk5w01,7,"So, my mom finally got diagnosed with BPD at the ripe ol’ age of 53 years old(after I managed to convince her to see a psychiatrist) and I thought I’d join this sub to get a better insight of what is going on in the mind of people who has this diagnosis, and maybe use some of the experiences mentioned here to help here in some way if she needs it. Even though my childhood has been problematic because of her, I still feel like I owe it to her, at least. 
I mean, she, a single mother with undiagnosed BPD, raising a kid(me) who is diagnosed with childhood autism and ADHD, and still manage to raise it into becoming am independant adult who has a future, and friends???  I owe it to her. I wanna do my best to try and support her."
If my bestfriend texted me saying sorry does she still hate me?,1,mkmlg7,4,"She texted me apologizing saying sorry for hurting you. She split on me at the end on February and I never gave up on her I still text her when I see she’s depressed and stuff on social media. She was suicidal I sent her a long message telling her how much I loved her and that she was really important to me and she immediately texted me back saying thank you and sent me deep music lyrics. It has been low contact since then until she texted me saying ‘sorry for hurting you’ i told her it was okay and I still love her the same I understand her and I won’t give up on her. I just want to know if she felt the need to apologize does she still hate me, does she care about me? I’m her FP and I’m just really confused 🥺"
Just ruined another relationship with someone I really care about because of my constant need for affirmation and ugly episodes of jealousy and manipulation.,8,mkc5uz,0,"It hurts a lot this time because last night I opened up to my friends, her included, for the first time about BPD and how irrational it makes me while having trouble controlling my jealousy and fear of abandonment. She says I made her feel like shit, which I now realize I did. God, I just wish I could act like a normal person and be secure in *something*. Not doing too great, guys. I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this shit. Everyone I care about ends up seeing my true self and leaving. Life sucks right now. Hope all is well with you, at least."
I hate how my BPD impacts my fiancé,1,mkm039,4,"I've been through a particularly rough spot over the last few months which led to my diagnosis. I'm swinging so much right now that my partner is having to monitor me and make sure I'm okay. I've been seriously struggling with suicidal ideation and I'm constantly switching between planning to seriously hurt myself and thinking that I can't do that to my partner.

I feel so horrible that he feels that he can't leave the house, has to hide medication/alcohol, and is living with the constant fear that he's going to find me dead.

It makes me feel horribly guilty. It also feeds into the bpd because I'm thinking that he doesn't deserve this and would be better off without me.

I'm trying to make sure he's got support too. But I don't know how much longer I can do this to him for."
DAE give stuffed animals personalities? TW: suicide,8,mkalp0,10,"Okay so, this has been something I’ve been doing since a child. Obviously most people have toys as kids and their parents may have played with them/given them personalities ... my parents did this a lot. They’d have voices and their own personalities. I’ve taken this into my teen years and even adulthood, I am turning 30 this year.
I have one particular Bear (his name is also Bear). I sleep with him every single night .. even when I stay away from home. I take him to hospital when I’ve attempted suicide or any other reason such as a recent surgery I had on a broken leg. I also cuddle him when I’m feeling down/overwhelmed. 
He has a voice that I put on for him, a complete personality and I basically treat him like another human. My boyfriend goes along with it too, setting him up in funny places, sending me pictures of him doing stuff while I’m at work etc... 
I work as a nanny and so I tell the kids about him like he’s a full on person.. it’s not just sometimes, it’s every single day.
Sometimes I’ll even express my own needs through him; for example telling my boyfriend “Bear is craving chocolates and asked to pick some up for him at the shops.”
I have a few theories as to why I do this but I was just wondering if anyone else does this too?

I’ve read in a few places that people with BPD and CPTSD (which I have both of) sometimes do similar things but I just thought I’d ask if anyone else does this.

I guess at the end of the day, I’m not worried because it makes me happy and makes me laugh, it’s a coping thing for me. Obviously though sometimes I feel like an utter whacko.

Thanks in advance."
Did anyone else’s parents reject their diagnosis?,93,mjvo5i,49,"I got diagnosed by two different psychiatrists and they were definitely right. I’m reasonably close with my parents but 80% of what goes on in my head and life they don’t know about. When I told them about the diagnosis (to each individually, they’re split up) they basically rejected it and claimed it wasn’t true. Did anyone else experience this? How did you deal with it?"
(i‘m the FP) - he hurts himself every time he accidentally upsets me. i can’t take this anymore.,14,mk7206,9,"TW: self harm

i‘m the FP of my bpd family member. every time he does something that visibly upsets me (usually by accident), especially if it‘s a big thing where i lash out, he goes away and hurts himself. i can hear the pounding (and sometimes crying/ grunting) coming from the other room and it’s unbearable. then he comes back with red body parts and is cooling himself under the tap, holding unto the body parts he hurt. he is super nice to me right after and offers to do very chores i‘m perfectly capable of myself, offers to take everything out of my hand (what i suppose is an attempt at „making things right“). 

i feel really uncomfortable and horrible about this. i refuse his help because it would feel wrong. I really don’t know what do in these situations. i can’t have him harm himself for me. i don’t know what to do.

i am so overwhelmed by all of this. i can’t feel responsible for someone watching my every move and hurting themselves if they think they „hurt“ me. i can’t take it. i can’t constantly watch what i do and say to make sure they don’t hurt themselves because of me. 

i know they can’t control it but it’s also killing me inside. i also know that it’s him punishing himself for me. that makes it even worse to bear. 

do you know what it feels like to see someone you love and care about come back into the room with bruises holding their limbs grunting in pain - all because they got the wrong cereal and you got upset. 

please tell me what to do because it’s killing me to see my love one destroy their body because of me , even worse, for me

how do i react ? how do i avoid this? can i do anything about it to make it stop?"
Dumbed down,1,mkkg83,1,"Ive been on proper treatment - taking my meds as prescribed - for 9 months now after defaulting many many times. I was on and off meds prior to an intervention. 

Does anyone else feel like they have lost their intellect due to meds? I used to be sharp, articulate, outgoing and everything but now ive become timid, afraid, shy and,,, slow? Its like a numb effect. Is it the drug abuse? Or the years of mental anguish growing up which spiralled into my relationships? Could it be the abuse im facing from my partner that ive become a timid little fuck? Could it just be the effects of the medication (im on mood stabiliser and antipsychotic and xan)? 

Ive lost friends over the course of my treatment cause i started being a fucking weirdo. Social cues are off. I learned that i tend to stare at people. I’m on my first job after having graduated with a first class honours degree but i can swear my colleagues look at me like there is something very wrong with me.

I really want to know. It’s really hard to not give up."
"I’m definitely the asshole in this, yet I’m triggered and excessively angry",1,mkkfo4,4,"I’ve been with my bf for nearly two years and we’ve always been good together. He’s kind and supportive and handles my issues pretty well. 
About a month ago I started talking to someone on Reddit and we still talk. I didn’t tell my bf until a few days ago. He didn’t like it but I assured him we were just friends and he’s okay with it. 
Now today I’ve woken up in the most horrible mood and when I was finally coming back from it again I noticed he was adding a coworkers number in his phone. He was struggling a bit with shortcuts so I helped him to open WhatsApp so he could send a message. As soon as I walked away though a very intense anger came over me and haven’t been able to let it go. My ex before him used to sext with random people and hide it and deny it and so this just triggered me massively. 
I feel like it’s completely unfair for me to be angry or hurt right now as he’s just talking to a coworker and he wasn’t even trying to hide it. Besides, I was talking to someone online and I didn’t tell him for a few weeks. I’m not really a jealous person usually (he sometimes talks about people at work flirting and that doesn’t do anything for me) but this just set me off. 
If I don’t try my hardest to shut up right now I’m just gonna blurt out something like ‘just go to her then and never come back’. 
I don’t know what to do and I can’t shed this anger. Help."
My family have given up on me,1,mkjo99,1,After another suicide attempt on Friday my family have decided they want nothing to do with me n haven't spoken to me since its only been 3 days but im so hurt they have left me on my own battling this awful illness with no help or support so now im feeling more suicidal than I was before...don't think I entirely knew the ripple effect my illness has on those around me thats prob why I'm on my own with no one now
DAE not split on the toxic people,1,mkjmph,7,"I’m not sure if this is how it is for the majority but I’ve been really struggling in a toxic relationship for about 7 months on and off, but like usually in a relationship I spilt after a month on someone as soon as any bad signs come up and I’m like over them instantly (which is bad I know) but as soon as I enter a relationship where I should probably get out, I just don’t. I continue to give everything and more and just never see the bad and switch up on them. I just end up more obsessed and hurt. 

I just wanna know if this is like something that PwBPD struggle with too or if it’s just something I’ve done to myself haha"
No good morning text,1,mkjk1i,2,"My girlfriend didn’t send a good morning text today and I saw that she was on Reddit. I’m thinking in my head that I’m not priority for her and that Reddit and the people she knows on there is more important than me.

Is this splitting or a BPD thing?

Edit: I’m actually just realizing that I might have BPD. It helped because before knowing about BPD , I would have texted her “it’s nice how your Reddit friends got a good morning, guess they’re more important than me, thanks a lot”"
Spouse,2,mkfzbb,8,"Sitting here in my bed on my 42nd birthday. Laying next to me is my wife of 15 years and the mother of my 2 children.
She was recently diagnosed with BPD and Bi Polar disorder.
For the past 15 years I have always been the empath and have always stuck by her side even though I knew she had Bi Polar about 5 years ago long before her recent diagnosis.
We have been fighting super bad since covid hit. So for the past year it has been a non stop fight. So after the last big manic episode she had, she told me she is moving to Las Vegas, she quit her job abruptly, ripped everything off the walls in the home that she purchased, jammed it all into a spare bedroom, and then finally took it all to a storage unit.
Well after about a week, she realized what she would be walking away from and  began back pedaling, asked me if she could stay. I love her with all my heart, but I told her NO.
That she opened up the flood gates and now has to live with her actions. Part of me want her to stay, and be her hero, her superman, the guy who has always been there for her. But other part of me says fuck it. Let her go and be free.
I fear for her safety, moving to Las Vegas all alone. We have been talking and she has been super hyper sexual. I guess we are not getting divorced, but separating for now and taking a break. I have a feeling she wants to sleep with other people during our break. It breaks my heart thinking about that happening. I know woman with BPD can be rather promiscuous, she swears she has not been with anyone since with got back together years ago. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation and had it work out? I want to think positively about the situation, but my anxiety and depression are getting the best of me. The more I learn about her diagnosis, the more I realize I suffer from many symptoms that spouses of  people who have BPD Deal with.
PTSD, from her yelling and screaming at me, throwing knives and causing me harm. Anxiety from feeling like I'm constantly walking on eggshells. Depression and feelings of worthlessness because anything I ever do for her is never good enough. Anyways dont even know why I'm sitting here awake on my birthday typing this out. But  just felt the need to vent about my situation and see if anyone out there can relate."

Well that went out the window when things got hot and heavy between us 

....what he doesn't know is that it's an entire act I put on to appear interesting and desirable and in reality I crave actual love making when they hold me and call me by my name not ""fucking slut"" or ""dirty bitch"" but I'm also terrified of intimacy and feel like my only place in this world is as a fuck toy 

Anyway he never spoke to me again after that night so who cares 🙃🙃🙃 (I fucking hate myself)"
"Surprised with (Quiet) BPD, but high functioning",6,mkankh,0,"I found out recently by accident that my psychiatrist diagnosed me with BPD. I was stunned. He has me on medicines for anxiety and depression, and he has never mentioned anything else. He has never recommended therapy of any sort.

Lots of what I have read about BPD rings true for me. I have a lot of difficulty with emotional regulation. I hide it well, but sometimes I am close to meltdown inside. I have never been in love, and while I’ve had a number of close friendships, I’ve started keeping people at a distance. I’ve also struggled with binge eating disorder since I was a child, and I think my BPD stems from years of undisclosed sexual abuse and parents who didn’t soothe or teach me anything about my feelings or managing my emotions. 

I don’t act out. I don’t use drugs, I don’t drink, I’ve never had any involvement with law violations, except for a traffic ticket five years ago. I am enrolled at a top 10 law school where I am in the top 10% of my class. I put on a show when I am around people. I am bubbly, funny, smart, earnest, hard-working, genuine. Sometimes that is true, but other times, I’m faking it, and I find it EXHAUSTING to me about people for long periods of time. 

I am REALLY struggling with the diagnosis. I’m angry my doctor didn’t tell me or refer me for counseling. I’m angry I didn’t know about this diagnosis before starting down the road toward a promising legal career. 

I sort of wish someone had told me several years ago. I have worked SO HARD to try to make up for what I had perceived to be poor social skills. I even considered if I might be on the autism spectrum, because I used to have really bad social anxiety and could not relate to people my age at all. If I had know earlier, maybe I wouldn’t have tried so hard. I’m not materialistic. Maybe I should have pursued SSDI or part-time, low-wage employment.

I don’t know if I can “fix” this. It feels pretty hopeless, and I’m terrified."
It's so hard,4,mkbtwc,1,"So my bpd really didn't manifest itself completely until last year (before they thought I was just bipolar). My parents kicked me out, I had to drop out of college, it's been impossible for me to hold a job, and now I'm couch surfing all because of it and I honestly don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm trans so I know things will get better once I transition but I don't want to wait if there's just gonna be more pain. My own friends have given up on me because I'm too ""borderline to deal with.""

impulsivity and other factors really getting me down,4,mk9vxs,4,"hi friends,

I struggle a lot with impulsivity in regards to my BPD. I spend a lot of money on trivial things, get tattoos, dye or cut my hair, promiscuous texts with strangers, or researching the next big change I want to make in my life and then never making it because I'm terrified. But if I'm not hyper-fixated on these impulsive choices, I feel ... an itch or a tension to just DO SOMETHING. it's like I need the release of these stupid behaviours to get through my emotions? idk if that makes sense. 

I thought about using an app like calm harm to ""ride the emotional wave"" but I haven't tried it yet because I'm scared to be alone with my thoughts. I've relapsed in self harm this week even though I was 8 months clean. It's my 27th birthday tomorrow and I just keep thinking about everything bad in my life, rather than good.

 I also have a physical disability that's getting worse and getting me down. apparently people with my disability are more prone to mental illness so that's fun. Not sure if this is just rambling now but, ugh. Advice?"
I need help...,3,mkci22,1,How the heck I’m so mad at myself. Why do I keep waiting on someone who’s told me to my face that they will never be the person i need. He never reassures me. I’m mainly the one who initiates to see each other and he rarely tries to even buy anything for us...ex: I mainly buy the food and snacks for us; and if he does it’s for himself and I have to pay for my own stuff. I don’t know why I have such a strong attachment with him. I don’t know what’s wrong with me clearly I don’t like myself as much as I claim to do. I don’t know I’m confused. I’m always thinking about this I get so insecure. Especially when we go to this one store I feel like he just focuses on the cashier girl and I hate it especially when he recommends going there. I’m going to decline the offer and see if he goes himself. I want to end this. This only makes me feel insane. He is not the person he put himself up to be in the beginning. He did some traumatizing things to be that I will never get over in my life. I’m so frustrated with myself why do I stay it’s so easy to just block him. I think about this day and night I never get a fucking break from this. I’ve lost so much time with friends and myself with just always being stuck in my head with this. What is this? I don’t want this how do I just stop this makes me mentally exhausted. I’m so tired of this this has been going on for a couple years now. I don’t get it. It’s not the ego of me getting rejected. Clearly it’s not even the good memories. I just always think about this. I feel like a broken record about this hence why I never tell anyone about this and then I just explode and I’m so MAD at myself. I HATE myself so much. I wish I never had this and I wish I valued myself more and stop selling myself short to him who clearly didn’t deserve me in the first place. I am too good for him. I know I am so what’s stops me? I need advice if anyone is going through this themselves......or just any pointers in general....
Question for BPD creatives/public figures.,4,mkaxfp,3,"Hi there, I’m an Actor.

And recently my career has been gaining a little traction, and I’ve been presented with the opportunity to go to Film School, becoming a successful actor has always been my dream, only ever since my mental breakdown a year ago I find myself terrified of success.

Those of you who have broken down before as well likely also know how hard it is to deal with the guilt after the fact, as well as the worry that everyone will find out and think you’re a horrible person. I didn’t do anything *gross* if you catch my meaning just to get that out of the way, but I was very emotionally manipulative, suicidal, and crazy, and I overshared VERY much on the internet and I know that if I get any real success, there will be the day that comes when an article gets written about me acting really crazy and awful for a year. I’m not pretending to be the good guy, I wasn’t, and for a long time before and after I wasn’t the good guy, but I now realize that I’m mentally ill and my mental health is my number one priority because I want kids, and I want a family, and I want a happy life and I can’t do any of that if I’m sick.

I’m not gonna pull a BPD and say that I’m fixed completely after 4 months of Therapy, but I’ve since gotten medicated and Therapy, and really the only things that are causing me pain nowadays aren’t the regular BPD symptoms. 

Since starting medication and therapy my moods have become less volatile, the chronic emptiness is gone, dependence on other people and toxic attachments are mostly gone, my anger is well under control, risky behavior, self harm are all gone, and I have people who I’ve known for years and years telling me that I seem like a wildly different person than I was a year ago, and even pre-breakdown, one that’s more stable, healthier, and all around better.

How do I deal with the reality that someday all of it is going to be thrown in my face eventually? Guilt and shame over past things I’ve done is honestly the only thing in my life that’s causing me pain right now, if it wasn’t for all of that I would be genuinely happy and glad to exist.

What should I do?"
My ex partner was diagnosed with BPD...,9,mk6jey,2,"I decided to post on this subreddit because I realized that the other BPD subreddits tend to be super negative and demonize people with BPD a lot. I'm not downplaying their experiences, but I just know that mine hasn't personally been that way 

My ex partner disclosed to me that he was diagnosed with bpd during an argument we had (for awhile i had urged him to get help over suicidal thoughts and depression). I'm not really sure how to process this information, i thought that seeing other people's experiences with people with BPD would give me more clarity but it almost stained my image of him because everyone just seemed so negative :/

I believe that when it comes to his illness, he doesn't seem to project it onto me very often (usually only during arguments) I've known him for two years now, and he seems to be more on the quiet side of the spectrum of the disorder. He does have a fear of abandonment but I've never witnessed him split on me really unless if its during an argument (which he usually apologizes after, (I'm assuming this is the guilt consuming him afterwards). Sometimes he also does suicide threatening gestures during arguments but since ive asked him to stop he hasnt done it again. Otherwise he is usually pretty loving and caring, usually puts my feelings first and I never thought that his intense emotions would boil down to a diagnosis of BPD I just assumed he was suffering from depression.

How can I understand him better? He is my ex but I do still plan on keeping him in my life and I still care about him. What are some things I can do to help him out? Can his diagnosis lead to a positive prognosis?"
I’m on a mission to understand the needs to the best of my ability.,2,mkdz17,7,"My fiancé has bpd. A lot of what I read on this subreddit are things that he has said to me. Like a lot of things down to exact wording. “Im always mad at myself for being mad at things that should be little things but they just aren’t for me” he’s always exhausted. Always feeling so intense. Even in times where I’m thinking “oh he must be doing ok lately” I learn that the storm has just been continuing silently in his head. I’ve learned a lot about him over the years but I want to know more. I want to be proactive and not “oh this happened and this is how I need to handle it next time”. Can you please share with me what you need from a partner? Like what do you want someone to say or do for you when you’re “angry over something most people find to be a minor issue”? Or when Your partner is the one who did something to make you experience intense feelings. Or what would you want your partner to do to be reassuring just throughout the day in general? If there are moments where you just want to lay in bed for several days on end, do you want someone who will encourage you to get up and do things you typically enjoy or do you want someone who will lay next to you the whole time(or do you prefer to be left alone for a bit even?). Basically, what’s something you find yourself saying “I wish someone/mg partner would..... “."
Loneliness is a disease,4,mkadbl,1,"I think my BPD used to be manageable because I had a friend group and I was always distracted or i would be smoking pot to turn off my emotions, but now i do not have any close friends I speak to on a daily basis and I quit smoking 3 months ago. Sometimes I feel so desperate for social interaction and a close bond with someone that I get so excited when anyone reaches out to me or puts minimal effort. I really miss having a best friend to hang out with regularly, it's been 3 years since I had a close group of friends and now all my relations are mostly surface level and I feel like there is something wrong with me. How can I cope with this loneliness? I feel guilty as well because I should be grateful for what i do have-i have great parents, a nice house, food on the table and I am able to pursue my dreams but I still feel a huge gaping hole in my heart. I even tried to manifest friends and I know that sounds silly. Does DBT help with these feelings of chronic emptiness/loneliness?? Or if anyone has any advice to cope with being alone pls comment, thank you."

Today marks 2 years since my last serious attempt. Never really opened up about this to the public before. But I’m an open book if you haven’t noticed. All I’ve got to say is this. If you’re struggling to find a purpose in life or in someone’s life, don’t. The meaning of life is simply to live. You are considerably lucky to be living and breathing right now. You were chosen one in a million for a chance to be here right now. Granted, we don’t know for how long or why. But stop trying to find a meaning to everything and just enjoy the greatest gift you’ll ever receive: being alive."
i’m completely lost and have no idea what to do. 20F,4,mkabns,3,"the loneliness i feel is so intense that words can’t properly describe it. i have had this loneliness for many years. it gets worse with age. sometimes i feel so deeply connected to certain people but then what i assume is reality hits and i realize i’m not actually connected to this person/these people like i thought. i have group of people who love and support me but.. there will always be a wall that i will never be able to tear down. between myself and everyone. no matter how hard i try. there’s something that’s just WRONG. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything is wrong. everything wrong. i cant keep doing this. 

 i have been struggling with this mental illness among others for years now and it has always been hard. i feel like i hit a new “rock bottom” every single month. it always feels like i’m in so much emotion pain and stress that there is no possible way it could get worse. it always gets worse.  or that’s what it feels like. it never gets better. 

i’m sorry that this is all over the place. i have no idea what to do anymore. i can hardly tell what’s real and what’s not anymore. i don’t know who i am. i am so lost. i cant take this anymore."
I feel like going away and never coming back...,2,mkds01,1,"Today I went to a shopping centre with my mum to get a book I wanted, and I ran into three of my friends there (I’ll call them ‘Sam’, ‘Max’, and ‘Hal’). I talked to them for a little bit until my mother told me that we had to leave, I could either stay with them or go home. I asked them if I could stay with them and Sam, and Max looked at Hal awkwardly, Hal said “no sorry, we don’t have enough seats in the car to take you to my house” even though they have five seats and there was four of them (including Hal’s dad). I offered that my mum take me but Hal said no. I got the message that she didn’t want me there, so I left.

I’ve been crying since. Maybe I should just never speak to them ever again. I was going to Max, Sam and a couple other friends over tomorrow but I just want to cancel it now. I didn’t invite Hal because she’s always been really snappy and insulting and I’ve just had enough of it, so I stay on friendly terms but don’t go out of my way to invite her over (two of my friends have also done the same thing with Hal).

I just want to leave and never speak to anyone I know again, I feel it’d be better that way. Maybe they all just hang out with me out of pity. I just want to cut myself off and never interact with anyone again. I just want to be alone."
Maybe this is just a rant but feel free to tell me if you feel the same,2,mkd94o,1,I defiantly feel like I’m spiraling in emotions right now. I’m just getting angry over the stupidest things and then I just get angry that I’ve gotten so worked up and now I’m just crying because wtf lol the only family I have left in my life is my grandma and I feel like I’ll never have a connection with her because I just can’t explain to her how I feel and I know she just wouldn’t understand anyways. I do love her so much but I’m so mad that I always feel so annoyed and triggered by the dumbest things when she’s around and like my mind just won’t let this dumb shit go.
"I sat in my backyard today, since my Cat passed.",4,mk9f73,6,"One of my cats passed away back in August of 2020. He passed away in my backyard, under one of the outdoor chairs that he was known to rest under.  
I was destroyed when I found him. I hyperventilated, had panic attacks and laid beside his dead body for about two to three hours, until my Mom and my sister's boyfriend discarded of his body.

After his passing, I sunk into a clinical depression that I haven't gotten out of.  
I lost my job. I've lost friends. I've lost family. My relatives hate me for not seeing them. I've stopped doing everything I enjoy. I've stopped leaving my room. I've stopped taking my medication. I'm always self-harming. I would sometimes spend weeks in my room without leaving it, without eating. I've lost so much weight that I've become a walking stick.  
My Mom will harass me through phone now and again, I'd let her know I'm still alive.  
I'm in horrible physical shape and was threatened to be hospitalized, but I was able to convince them that I wasn't suicidal and would start caring more for myself.   
I'll be getting treatment soon through DBT classes.

I rarely step outside the house, I prefer not too because of the anxiety I face and how terrible I look physically.. I'm horribly unattractive. COVID has enabled me a lot with isolating myself.  
I used to play in the backyard with my cats, I haven't stepped into the backyard since his passing.  
I didn't last very long today. I sat on the steps for a few minutes until my eyes wandered onto the spot he passed. I broke down and haven't stopped crying since.

I still feel immense guilt and shame about his passing. He died young, and I feel like it was my fault. I feel like I could have saved him. I feel like I let him down. He was one of the only things in my life that kept me going. We loved each other so much, he tried so hard to heal me, and I fucking failed him. I can't forgive myself for his death. I don't want to forgive myself for his death. I feel like I deserve to suffer.

I'm starting DBT soon and admittedly I feel like this would be stupid to bring up.  
I'll be in a group with other people, which I really dislike. I have a horrible tendency to compare my issues with the other group members, and my issues seem and feel so irrelevant, stupid and unimportant.  
My life issues are nothing compared to what the others face.   
Being suicidal and destroying myself over a Cat would seem minor and like a joke. They are all dealing with so much, with real problems, and I'm here crying over a Cat.  
Why am I even joining DBT, I feel pathetic?

..I don't know what I'm getting at. I'm just tired and really needed to vent. I don't have anyone to talk too about the things I'm going through, or the things I feel.  
This is probably stupid, I'll delete soon.

Thanks for reading, I guess."
How to convince my friend with BPD I care about them,3,mkay6b,0,"So I met this girl and we've been friends for a while, but before I knew about their BPD it was a very rocky relationship. I felt as though at times they hated me and would get upset for no reason. Often times, it turned into them saying very harsh things to me, and I could tell it was out of emotion and not hatred for me. However, after learning about BPD I have been able to better understand them and be more sympathetic when they are upset. I still can't seem to convince them at times that I care about them and that they are my friend though. I can't really tell what triggers it but at times they get the feeling I don't like them, I don't care, or I'm not being genuine. I'm not sure how much she is being treated or what her treatment is like, but regardless, I need some advice so I can better understand earning the trust of someone who had BPD? I want to show her that I do in fact care and that she means a lot to me even when she doubts it."
My (F) GF is her exGF's favorite person,3,mkawo5,1,"My girlfriend is friends with her ex who has BPD and my girlfriend is her ex's ""favorite person."" My girlfriend has said to me that she is afraid of what the emotional/physical consequences of her leaving the friendship (it can be quite toxic or even abusive at times) or talking about our relationship might be. I think that her ex has said that my girlfriend is the only thing she lives for, so my girlfriend is afraid that her ex will stop living if she isn't taking care of her. Any advice?"
How to cope with feelings of loneliness,3,mkcx98,3,"This past week I downloaded an app that has me tracking my meals. I know that nourishing my body is an important part of self care and I thought this app would be a useful tool. I'm doing this in an attempt to increase my mindfulness over food and it's definitely working in that regard. I've never counted calories (this app calculates the calories for me) or kept a food journal before and it has been illuminating. By doing this, it's become glaringly obvious that I have a problem with emotional eating in the evenings when I am alone. 

My eating habits throughout the day are pretty good. I'm making healthy choices, appropriate portions, and eating at regular times. The problem comes when it's time to log my ""evening snack."" Tonight my evening snack started as a slice of angel food cake with strawberries and whipped cream. Then about an hour later I ate a bowl of cereal - but I was still ""hungry"", so I had some cottage cheese and crackers. But I was still hungry after that so I made some ramen noodles with cheese. In all, my total calorie count for evening snack came to about 1300 calories. 

This happens at night when I'm in my apartment alone. I'd say the predominant feeling is a crushing sense of loneliness and I don't know how to cope with it other than eating to the point of feeling physically uncomfortable. Hence, I do consider this a form of self-harm. I'm not eating to nourish my body. I'm eating to avoid that feeling of loneliness.

So I've been trying to brainstorm alternative (healthier) coping mechanisms. If the troublesome feeling is loneliness, it would make sense to reach out for support. However, it's not exactly appropriate to be calling up my friends at such a late hour. In a pre-covid world, I might make a late-night Walmart run. However, the Walmart here closes by 10pm now. I don't live too far from a bar. I could go there to be around people, but I'm afraid to be drinking around strangers when I'm feeling so vulnerable. The bar solution just seems like a recipe for regrettable sex or even another sexual assault.

I have tried practicing radical acceptance and sitting with the feeling of loneliness, but suicidal ideation and feelings of helplessness come in so quickly. I start thinking that I'm alone. I'm never going to find a place that feels like home or people who feel like family. I am so broken that I'll never be able to change that. I don't think sitting with these thoughts is good for me either.

Surely, I can't be the only BPD person who struggles with being alone. Have you guys found helpful (or at least less harmful) ways of coping with these feelings? Maybe an action or activity I can engage in? Or even a new thought strategy might be helpful."
'Everyone thinks I'm so annoying' 'everyone hates me' -says my brain to myself.,3,mkapwb,1,Just needed a safe space to vent perhaps I might feel better after. Suffering from BPD and also addiction is hard. Today i am 11 days sober. That's huge for me truly. Thats the longest ive been sober in 3 years. Today is really really hard for some reason. I deleted all my contacts for connects to get high once I went into rehab before. I have a few friends that still get high. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that i crave the high. I messaged a few people today to try and make something happen. Nothing panned out. But i feel even worse now than i did before. They read and didn't reply. My brain tells me that its because I am a bad person and they didnt reply because they dont like me. My logical part of my brain kinda says maybe they didnt want to aid in my addiction? That is quickly replaced with thoughts from my bpd brain saying it's my fault that i dont have connects because no one wants to talk to me and no one cares. Even reading over this post now as i type I almost feel to need to delete it all because i dont want to sound like a freak who complains and be that person that everyone hates. Ugh. Im struggling hard today. I have no one right now. I know the people i messaged asking for drugs will talk about me to our other friends. I wonder what they will say. I'm so fucked up right now about this. God i sound like such a whiner. This is exactly why my friends didn't message me back.
Im sad oh so sad i want to fucking die,7,mk5t7k,2,"Hi friends I want to die. I’ve gained so much weight I look at myself in the mirror and I’m just so tired... it’s so exhausting to hate yourself so much. Worst thing is knowing What I have to do to control my weight and have not only no motivation to do what I need to do but also despair over not having motivation. 

Im such a pos. When I see a good looking woman I want to curl up in a ball. In those moments I literally feel that I would be better off dead than look how I do. 

Im disgusting. My bf has helped me enough to where I don’t feel fear of abandonment over my looks bc he’s so loving and supportive but... idc if he thinks I look good... I know I’m disgusting.

I want to die over this it haunts me everyday and I can’t stop binge eating and when I think I’m doing well I weigh myself only to find out I weigh more than I did when I was over eating. And then I binge bc what’s the point. 

FRIENDS I HATE Myself. This amount of despair cant be normal. I can’t bring myself to work out. I hate myself."
"I made a mistake while driving, and now I want to kill myself.",5,mk8k10,4,"I was doing an okay job at holding myself together today, and in an instant it's all gone. Not just driving, this mistake makes me want to give up on everything else in my life too.

Instantly after it happened, my mind started going down the list of my ambitions and dismissing them all: ""I'm too worthless, incompetent, stupid, mentally ill, ugly, and meek to make any of them happen. I can't show my face in this town again. I have to go start over in another town now - until I make another mistake there, then I'll have to move again. I'm irredeemable because of all the mistakes and stupid things I've done dating back to kindergarten. I'm a bad person with bad thoughts. No one could like me and I'll only detract from their life. I don't like anything about myself. I don't like life. I really need to die right now.""

I have a general sense of confusion that is one of the worst thing I experience mentally. I think it's a symptom of my derealization and BPD together. The confusion gets really bad when I'm stressed. It just makes me want to beat my head (and I have) because it feels blocked - I can't understand any of my intense emotions, what led to what, or why. I can't put things into perspective, and I absolutely cannot validate my own feelings.

I've lived my life with my head down and not sharing myself because I don't know what is okay and what isn't, and I've always cared a lot about what others think. I can't handle any sort of conflict because I feel worthless and wrong no matter what. I've been a chameleon with no true identity and no mental stability as far back as I can remember. I've always been secretive about myself, and I never really understood why. It deeply bothers me that I'm not able to understand myself.

I don't know where to start in order to get better. I don't have a clear picture of what better is. It feels like there is just too much to work through. I'm scared of going back to therapy because I don't want to feel invalidated again. I know there is a lot of trial and error when trying to find a therapist that clicks with you, and money is tight. I always came out of therapy sessions feeling more hopeless."
What feels the worst is when everything is irritating,4,mka543,1,"Why does it have to be like this?

Absolutely not. But that’s still what it feels like. Goddamn every other sentence out of his mouth feels like that. He doesn’t deserve that. 
So the point is how do I stop with this? It’s maybe once a week or so. Or when I’m PMSing. I don’t know what to do about it but it is extremely challenging. I’m losing my mind I just want to be able to hang out with him. I have to avoid him when I’m like this because I’m an asshole to him and then he just feels bad. It’s so fucking obnoxious to be me."
Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from their memories?,11,mk1r97,7,"I’m kind of new to the whole thing so it might be a super obvious BPD thing but does anyone feel completely disconnected from their memories?
Whenever I move to a new place (which happens quite often) or something else major in my life changes, a relationship or whatever, I completely close the chapter in my head and I whatever memory I have before that time just feels like it wasn’t me. 
I can remember what I did and what happened and how I felt but it feels like someone else’s memory, if that makes sense. At this point in time, memories up to last summer feel ‘real’ and mine but anything before that feels like someone else’s memories that somehow appeared in my head."
I feel like I can never get a job because of my BPD,39,mjuxrc,9,"In 2017 I got fired from my first and only job. A coworker had been bullying me for months and nobody was taking it seriously. My boss said I was being histrionic and making things up. The other people I worked with deflected because they didn't want to get caught up in drama or pretended they knew nothing. I tried to file a complaint but they said unless he was sexually harassing me, they had no case. One day he made a joke about my grandpa who had just passed away and I just snapped, I had a very public meltdown. My boss was furious, she kind of got physical with me by grabbing me by the collar, which choked me, and dragging me into another room. She called me pathetic, an embarrassment, and that some clients had seen me and were disgusted. I had tarnished our company's reputation and potentially lost them tens of thousands of dollars.

After that I spent 6 months in the psych ward, trying to gather all the broken pieces of myself and put them back together. I was already a shy and awkward person prior to the incident, but this just crippled me. I have good people skills and a strong sense of empathy, but none of that matters if I get paralyzed with fear when I'm around anyone other than my close family and friends. If somebody I don't know well gets within my proximity, I panic - I feel nauseous, lightheaded, my limbs feel numb, flight response. I'm paranoid and afraid that they'll abuse or attack me. It's irrational, but my brain paints almost everyone as being a potential threat.

For the past couple years, I've been trying to find an entry-level job where I don't have to be around others or talk to anyone. I refuse to let something like what happened 4 years ago happen ever again. I know it's black-and-white thinking, but I'm adamant. I haven't had much luck because most of them require skills I lack, like having a good memory or being accurate and efficient. I'm not really interested in or good at anything, when I have a FP I will force myself to like specific things because I want to try and impress them, but I have no FP at the moment so I have no interests. I'm stuck in this uneasy situation and it makes me miserable."
Being dropped from DBT,4,mk9v1q,5,"This is going to be a bit of a rant but.  My therapist team has told me maybe DBT isn’t right for me at the moment because basically my drug & alcohol use has been getting really bad again.  And Altho I’m getting drug & alcohol councelling on top of this , they still have an agenda against people who use drugs & im just heartbroken to be honest. They told me that I should just stick with the drug& alcohol councelling see how that goes.  But I was planning to do that anyway.  Then they say they gonna try me with CBT team instead.  Which said I needed DBT not CBT, passed me back to my DBT team. And Altho I’m on the phone to them multiple times a week having a crisis. How could they drop me like this.  It feels like I’m being passed from pillow to postI’m genuinely baffled & feels like no one wants me.  

Rant iver"
Why am I like this >.<,2,mkbveq,0,"TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ 

My FP was crying and I asked why.. he told me it was because of family stuff and us stuff and everything. I started to cry because I didn't like seeing him so sad. I know he likes space when he's that sad so I asked him if he need space. He said yes for a little while. I walked away and went to my closet. I felt so upset like its my fault.. and it might be. I think I've been stressing him out a lot because my moods have been all over the place and I've been struggling to control myself the last few days. So I sat down and started cutting... I'm afraid he'll notice later and be mad. He should have the right to be sad and cry and worry about himself and not me. I don't want him to think he has to worry about me when he's upset."
The expectations of normal life are crushing me,47,mjtpww,6,"I’m a full time student and part time retail worker and I just am drowning in it. The expectations of my professors, my boss, and my parents exhaust me and I don’t think I can put up with it anymore. No one understands the struggle I go through every day with masking all my emotions, the disassociation, the chronic emptiness or the lack of motivation from being depressed. Like getting motivation to get out of bed for school or work or even simply getting out of bed to go eat or shower has become a chore. I’m so low atm I don’t get how ppl push on. I constantly have something on my to do list and it’s leaves me completely unable to relax and enjoy life. And now I’m stuck in a like burned out state pushing my self farther and farther into a deep depressive state. But this is just normal life expectations that everyone puts up with and that kills me inside that I can’t even to the like bare minimum without feeling completely overwhelmed and exhausted."
Rant,4,mk6yvc,1,"This is my first time post, so I apologize if it isn’t cohesive... I’ve been in an out of counselling and therapy for a couple years and been diagnosed with BPD for a while but the diagnosis never bothered me. I was more concerned with how I felt and how I feel in a given time. These days I don’t even know what feelings are because Ontario has been in lockdowns for months i just transferred to another uni in a different city and that’s exactly when covid hit 

Plus I’m an international student here so that made it better being in a new city all alone just in a dorm.. I met some ppl along the way but I’ve been so concerned with being a nuisance or a bother to people so I’ve always kept my distance even when they ask to hang coz I feel like bother. 

I’ve decided to change all this but I’m hit with my  own self deprecating negative thoughts and I have no clue sometimes what to do with it. 

Thanks for taking time to read this... I just kinda wanted to rant, sorry if I wasted your time 

Hope y’all have a good day and stay safe"
Apologized to my ex... Felt awesome.,6,mk57m7,2,"Before I say this, I don't have any feelings for this man anymore... But I did feel the need to apologize. So my ex, we dated for 2 years, 2016-2018. I treated him like complete shit. My BPD was untreated and I didn't know any coping mechanisms at all. I was horrible. He still wanted to work things out with me and then I left him because I thought I didn't deserve him. Then, he found someone else and I got mad. Yeah. Stupid. I know. But I wouldn't speak to him but we finally will kinda talk now.. I don't wanna piss his lady off too much though. She doesn't like me, even though she's never met me, and I guess I can see why. I asked him if he wanted me to stop talking to him and he said no. I told him I was sorry for everything. I still care for him platonically and hope he's okay, and happy. I just never had any examples of love growing up, either. He said he understood, and I didn't even have to apologize to him because it was always okay. It still felt good, and I'm proud of myself. I used to have a huge issue apologizing."
How do I (19F) live with being cheated on repeatedly by someone (20M) I cannot bring myself to leave?,1,mke0bx,2,"Please, please, please read. I need help with this and I promise it will be somewhat interesting.

As pretty much everyone with BPD knows, relationships are undoubtedly the main source of happiness and the main source of pain in our worlds, no matter how much we wish they weren’t. So this is of course; my entire world right now.

I will try to keep this as short as I can while still providing enough detail to understand the situation. I met (we will call him Chase) in late 2019 off of a dating app, and within 10 minutes of hanging out we had a connection and a chemistry that could not be ignored. We were both very unstable and rushed into a relationship that lasted about 2 months, until a specific time that he broke up with me and didn’t call me back 5 min later, as he usually did. That was in February 2020, and from that point until August (about 7 months) it was about as toxic as it gets. He preyed on every last vulnerability I had as a borderline - blocking and leaving me for 2 weeks, coming back in and saying all the right things for about a week, verbally attacking me telling me I’m weak and essentially worthless and manipulating me into apologizing to HIM for god only knows what, and repeating all of these things, over and over and over and over and over. I was exhausted. Suicidal every minute of every day - except for when he was giving me attention, which was rare. He would swoop back in, come over, laugh with me for hours like we were best friends, fuck me 4 times in one night, and then not even seem to know I existed the next day. He had his own issues and the amount of times I had to talk him down from suicide was unbelievable. What made it unbelievable is what it looked like in comparison to the amount of times I tried to cry on his shoulder or confide in him when I was on the sheer edge of suicide, and he would say something like “I don’t have time for this shit” and block my number for a week. 

It. Was. Awful. I am sparing many details as to keep this shorter but in short, it was a borderline’s worst nightmare. I did attempt suicide during this time and I’m actually proud of myself for only attempting once, seeing as I had a debilitating panic attack around once a day. I couldn’t bare it. But I couldn’t fucking pull myself out. I was also an alcoholic, which made me much more susceptible to his abuse. 

In early July 2020 I came to a breaking point one night, and I just somehow knew, I knew if I was going to survive I had to do 2 things: put down the bottle and leave. Looking back, leaving was easier because he had me blocked and had already left me (I knew he’d always come back, but I needed to not let him.) So I did it. I remember the day. July 7th, I threw away what was left of my alcohol, and just began living a Chase-free life. I really did so fucking well. I think I could’ve even walked away forever. He had hurt me bad enough at this point that’s the thought of him genuinely made me want to vomit, and I somehow made my brain stick with that instead of romanticizing him. Being sober was also necessary in this process. I swear, I had more control over myself and my life in the month of July 2020 than I ever have, and fear I ever will have again. 

Sometime in early August he came back again. I had done so well, ignoring his calls messages but on this particular night I convinced myself that there was nothing wrong with checking in and asking if he was ok. He could 100% sense that I was somewhat moving on, and that he had almost no control of me at all. It was so obvious how much that drove him crazy. Him and I always had a deep, deep connection, but I was unbelievably clingy and suffocating up to this point, so he didn’t feel the need to appreciate our connection as something he could lose until now. So of course, he begged and he pleaded, and he cried until he sobbed until he threw up, not giving up until I told him I would give him another chance. I couldn’t quite say no to him. I had come so far to a point where I could essentially live without him, but saying no to him was not a strength that I had. So what I did say what is that if he could keep this act up for a month, this act of wanting to actually be with me, to really, really be with me, I might give him a chance. And that’s exactly what he did. Only it wasn’t an act. Everything changed in August. It was as if I was no one before, and suddenly he was in love with me. And it’s been that way ever since. He could not possibly bring himself to leave me now. 

We were still very toxic, but we became so close, no one could tear us apart. We were a literal team. He became part of my family, coming to Thanksgiving and Christmas, and anywhere else I went with me. We were (and are) so codependent on each other that it worked, bc we just fed each other’s codependency. He dedicated all his time to basically overcompensating for the pain he put me through for so long. I resented him so much, and we fought about it all the time, but it did give me some power in the way that no matter what, he always felt like he owed me. I never do the dishes anymore, take out the trash, or go a night without getting a back scratch. I’ve got to admit it was pretty nice. Especially considering the fact that I have been in love with him for so long and this is all I had dreamed of, never actually believing it would become a reality. It’s as if somebody dropped $1 million in a homeless man’s lap. You constantly ache for it, but you have the sense to know it will never happen. But it did for me.

All of this was ripped apart two weeks ago. I won’t get into all the gory details, but on March 20th, he accidentally fucked up and basically outed himself. It wasn’t necessarily proof that he was cheating, but it was proof that he was hiding something from only me on his phone. I knew in that moment he was cheating, and I shut down. I would not speak to him. This always drives him insane. He cries and cries and panics and begs and says anything and talks himself into corners until I give in and speak to him again. This time the only words I could muster were, “the only way you’re going to fix this is if you unlock your phone and hand it to me”. This is not something I ever wanted to do. I have avoided it at all fucking costs. He was always so secretive with this phone, and I denied in my head that he could be cheating because it would be too much to handle. I assumed that he just watched a fuck ton of porn or something, and didn’t want me seeing anything like that in his phone, which would have made me uncomfortable but I would’ve been fine, so I was okay believing that that’s what I was in denial of. 

Okay so I am trying not to drag this on. Let me just give the major details of what has gone on in these past two weeks. I saw on his phone that he was messaging hundreds of women (or at LEAST 100), from women he had already messed around with, to women he messaged on Instagram, to women he met on dating apps, to women he worked with, and there was literally no end to it. He flirted with anything that had a vagina and a pulse. I don’t even fucking understand how he found the time to do it. It had to be literally all he was doing every time he or I went to the bathroom, every time he laid awake next to me while I slept, every time I went to work (only 20hrs a week) and the very few times that he ever went home or went and hung out with his friend. We spent every moment together. He did none of this right next to me. Most of what he did was sexting and essentially begging for nudes. I know for a fact he begged one girl to fuck and flirted relentlessly with her for months until she felt bad for me and stopped answering, starting in AUGUST, the month he pledged his love to me and basically said he would slit his own wrists before ever causing me any pain again. Getting on his hands and knees to let me let him prove to me that he could be good to me, and make up for everything that caused me to resent him from the past, telling me he would do everything in his power for the rest of his life if that’s what it took. Meanwhile, CHEATING AND CHEATING AND CHEATING AND CHEATING AND CHEATING. He has ONLY admitted to what I had literal proof of and shoved in his face. I know for a fact there is so much more, and I’ll probably never know what it all is.

To say my boyfriend was sexually satisfied with me is an understatement. We fucked at least twice a day (we’ve been living together pretty much, he’s not on the lease but i had to start paying for him). I took many hot, hot ass nudes for him because he would beg. He was and is literally obsessed with my body, it could even make him cry, it was honestly a little weird to me, but it made me feel beautiful and special. I could make him come at the snap of a finger and I could make him hard in an instant after that. He always did this one thing that truth be told made me a little uneasy and just seemed like he was simping: nearly every time he would come he would be panting and holding me and say “I could literally never ever possibly have a reason to cheat on you.” It was weird to me because like, I didn’t ask? It’s one of those things you hope is fucking understood without saying out loud you know? Like obviously? Is that supposed to give me butterflies? I don’t know. I assumed it was his way of telling me how sexually satisfied he was with me, and I sure as fuck believed it. HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN LYING THIS WHOLE TIME??????

He has tried to kill him self 3 times since March 20th, and almost tried to more than that. Twice in front of me with anything sharp he could find trying to slit his throat, me having to wrestle him to make him stop, and once last Monday, resulting in a mental hospital stay which is where he currently still is. Sometimes it’s when I tell him I’m done and I can’t fucking do it and he needs to get out of my house. Sometimes it’s when I tell him I’m probably gonna fuck someone else now. Whatever it may be, he’s the one that freaks out and I’m the one that has to calm him down or clean blood off of his neck (superficial wounds), even when the both of us know I’m going through much worse pain. 

He BEGS and SOBS and tries to fucking kill him self for gods sake trying to get me to listen to him when he says he can fix it, he’ll get therapy, we’ll go to counseling, blah blah blah. Do you know how much I want to believe that? How many chances I’ve given this motherfucker? The time? The sex? The money? The love? My family? I have been the only good thing in his life for a long time. I have bled myself dry for him. He has watched what it does to me. Seen me have episodes. Seen me get physically sick from the stress he puts me through. He cries and sobs that he hates himself and loves me with every part of him, but then the same day he does that he can go into the bathroom and text some girl trying to set up plans for 3 AM. 

Thought I would add that we recently decided he is probably borderline too, but he hasn’t been able to be seen by a psychiatrist or anything, he’s been trying to get insurance. Just thought that might be slightly important to add. 2 borderlines, what a storm.

It is just simply my worst nightmare. The pain I feel. The emptiness. The lack of control. The worthlessness - not being enough. The betrayal. I was sober for months but slowly I have gotten back to the point of only being able to cope with liquor, 24/7. I can’t stop. I can’t leave him. This time he is a literal part of me and my fucking family. I try with everything in me but I am nothing without him. And he will not fucking leave me. Being away from him is impossible but being touched by him makes me cringe, unless I’m so drunk that I can’t walk straight. 

What. Do. I. Do."
I need help,2,mkafr8,1,"I’ve been gradually cutting myself off from the world the last few years by accident while seeking help. I have gotten none.

I feel like crawling in a ditch or running away to live in the forest,71,mjr6r9,10,"Everyday I wake up depressed, go through my morning routine to drag me out of my funk, and go throughout the day juggling priorities. After spending a whole day trying not to breakdown, I end up feeling like everything is bullshit. I'm irritated all the time and everyone becomes a nuisance. Of course I don't want to feel these ways, and I mentally reassure myself and repeat why I need to keep going to school and work and talking to people, but I just feel so uninterested in everything. I can't even enjoy what I am passionate about. I've been putting in all this self-work and while I can look back and see how much I've progressed that alone is not enough. I have nothing in life besides knowing I did my best because everyday I feel like I am fighting something. I'm tired of telling myself that trying my best is all that matters, because it's really not. I'm tired of feeling like I'm just trying to survive.

Does anyone else have trouble admitting people like you?,15,mjy0mz,1,"Let it be known, I just got diagnosed with this a month ago and I’m still learning about my diagnosis. 
This post goes toward any kind of relationship, not just romantic. I have trouble connecting with almost everyone. 
I just got into a relationship and I already find myself second guessing. I feel like I’ve lost interest in him solely because I can’t stand to let myself admit that someone enjoys my presence. I want to isolate myself from him and everything else. I feel like it would be so much easier if I just didn’t have to deal with human interaction most of the time, but I also have this intense feeling of wanting to be wanted. I care about the guy a lot, I wait for his messages and I ask him about his day... but I feel annoyed when he asks me how I am or what I want to do. For some reason I just have trouble trying to admit that he likes me even though he drives out to see me and hangs out with me for hours."
Not being able to talk to your FP about your feelings towards them because they couldnt possibly understand how much of an impact they have on you,16,mjxr99,5,"This is one of the worst things about a FP.

I sent a text saying ""happy easter"" to my FP a few hours ago (we only text or call nowadays because they moved pretty far away recently). Figured it would be too much to call since its just easter so i texted. They read my text and didnt even bother to respond.

Normally id be like ""whatever"", but this is my *FP*. And its not just some poor bastard that i started obsessing over that doesnt want to have anything to do with me. Its a person that until not very long ago i was very close to and that used to genuinely like me very much. Now i cant even get a lousy ""happy easter to you too!"" back.

This isnt the only thing anyway. The times ive tried and failed to make conversation in the last while all went pretty much the same way. But im also not being ghosted, because sometimes they text me some basic bs and we talk for a bit. But its just not the same energy like back in the day anymore.

The ""happy easter"" text broke the camel's back. And i want to just tell them what a shitty friend they are and cut them off completely and generally just start shit about it.

But i cant. Because this is just a person that didnt respond to a text. They cant possibly understand the way im feeling, its just not normal to them. How am i supposed to rage at them about this? I cant.

This is literally the worst thing about having a FP. Their words or actions can cause you the most intense pain, anger and sadness but if you called them out theyd think youre crazy and insane. Which lets be honest...."
DAE sob over people you barely know? I went from being extremely happy to being scared of abandonment.,17,mjw2ko,1,"Well I had a positive social interaction today and for once I felt happy/content. This was followed by a short period of hyperactivity. I was basically running around my house and rapidly speaking while telling my sibling about the people I had met. I felt so incredibly grateful for them, they were inspiring and made me happy and grateful to be alive. So much so, to the point where I wanted to cry because I felt so happy. But at the same time, a part of me felt unworthy of their love. I tried to suppress the tears and now 5 hrs later I am sobbing because I'm scared that they're going to leave me and I'm not going to be happy/supported anymore. My brain has even made up scenarios where they are getting hurt/dying and I'm being abandoned. I know this sounds crazy :(."
Bpd and eating disorders,2,mk97h6,4,"Anyone else have an eating disorder? I have quiet BPD and I'm not formally diagnosed with an eating disorder, but I definitely have one.

I don’t know who I am,5,mk3igk,1,"I know this is common with BPD but I don’t know what I like or dislike or what I want to do with my life. I feel like an outsider and everyone is has friends and families and *lives* when I have nothing.

For over a year now it’s fantasizing a life with person I only hooked up with a handful of times while studying abroad and he ghosted me basically. It’s embarrassing and pathetic.

I finished watching the show Felicity and I feel so depressed now because I didn’t want it to end. I’m now finishing college and I wish I lived in that world and had those friends and those relationships because I’ve lost my roommates/friends because of my BPD. Certain shows come around for me that are such an escape from my reality, a reality I don’t want to live in.

Increase of extremely bad memory :(,97,mjo6r9,18,"I am running into an unpleasant issue.

Entire years are kinda gone.

At the very least I wash my hands obsessively because of OCD and shower daily so no overall hygiene problems.

Every moment I'm not actively occupied by something school related I'm trying to distract myself. Hopping from one show to another before losing interest, not necessarily enjoying myself but tiding myself by not letting myself think.

Only thing that bring me actual joy are sex, hot shower, and just the notion of heat in general. I let ny hands linger longer than necessary to feel some warmth. 

Even food isn't really fulfilling. Honestly it's ironically the lack of fulfillingness that's finally getting me to work on my weight.

I don't know, I just don't know how to pull myself out of this slump. Just trying to ward myself from the thoughts of loneliness, lack of worth and no purpose but everything just feels so empty."

I shouldn't have been saved. I keep reaching out to her, so long after what's happened. I try hard not to, I often go several months without doing it, then one day, the pain becomes too much and I ask her to try and reconnect.

It's so hard. I am such a fuck up. I've never had someone treat me so well, yet I treated her so poorly and would scare her with my anger due to way back when I bullied her.

I bullied, I apologized, we became friends, now we aren't because I got too clingy.

I just want her back so bad. I'd do anything. I feel so dumb and worthless. She should have let me die."
"I'm so, so scared",8,mjxtzm,8,"CW: sex, past abuse, rape, trivial issue

I used to be hypersexual. Mostly because I was starved for affection and you kind of take any show of affection you can in that situation.

I got easily manipulated and sweet talked into sexual favours. And then always felt like shit after. I did anything anyone wanted me to. I was underage at the time and doing shit with older guys.

I'm 19 now. Six months ago, I was raped. I've been sexually abused before but this was the textbook definition.

The sight of my naked body disgusted me after that. I became completely asexual. I've recovered since then.

I met this guy, from my other account, on Reddit. He seemed (seems) sweet, attentive and understanding. He didn't push me to have cam sex. He just said he liked my body and other stuff. Why the fuck then did I say all the right things to seduce him, helped him get his rocks off and pretend to have an orgasm?

He said he was tired after and would text me later. That's completely understandable. Inside my head however, I gave him sex, he's supposed to show me affection.

Like an idiot, I asked him if he would talk to me later, 'have an ordinary conversation'. And he said, yeah, for sure.

I'm attached. I'm an idiot. I feel so stupid and angry and I'm crying.

As I was typing this, he messaged me asking if I wanted to go for a second round later tonight. I said, 'maybe'.

FUCK. Why do I feel so heartbroken. How do I deal with this in a healthy, normal person way?"
Does anyone else find dissociating kind of comforting?,146,mjk31m,18,"I know it’s a coping mechanism to distance yourself from the present reality or to deal with the effects of a traumatic event, but does anyone else find it kind of... nice?
I dissociate so often I find that most of my days feel like blurs. But I like the feeling of just being able to tune out of real life for a minute and feel nothing. Due to a recent devastating passing in my family, all I want is to feel nothing. Dissociation numbs the pain. It makes me feel like my body isn’t mine and like I’m watching my life through someone else’s eyes. The first time I experienced it it scared me, It felt like being high or something. But now I can do it on command and find myself zoning out just to stay sane. Lately I don’t know who I am. I don’t know how to talk to people anymore. I don’t have the motivation to socialize. I don’t feel like myself. I’m so in my head all the time worrying about saying something stupid, so I just don’t say anything at all. I feel broken and incapable of functioning like a normal person. I see all these people around me making connections and enjoying themselves but the only time I feel at peace is when I feel like I’m not really there. But then I hate myself for being so socially awkward. I wasn’t always like that. I used to be the most social person in the room and now I’m the one in the corner zoning out of the conversation. How can I get people to like me when I don’t even know who me is anymore? Damn. I don’t want to die but taking a 5 month nap and waking up when shit isn’t shit anymore sounds really fucking nice."
New to bpd and Reddit,1,mkas9t,1,"Hello! I’m new to this group, I’m looking for some help or guidance from people who experience this personally. I’m wondering if it’s possible to have BPD without the fear of losing someone. In fact knowingly sabotaging a relationship."
I lost my shit at someone,2,mk4boe,5,"Fuuuuuck 

I normally keep it all ""inside"". I have such turbulence with my feelings but I hide it as  much as I can so I'm either ""super happy"" or ""a bit low"" to others.

Recently I've just been done. I'm just sick of everything and I've given up. 

I was told I should reach out to people so I reached out to my group. They were nice about it...it was very hard describing my feelings though

This guy though.

This. Fucking. Guy. 

He admitted ""feelings"" for me a couple of weeks of knowing each other online, at first I kinda liked him even though the idea of a relationship terrified me and I wanted to take it slow. 

He wouldn't listen, he would push more and more. Wanting to meet me irl, wanting to plan trips together, constant compliments when they made me uncomfortable and I'd tell him please stop then later he'd say maybe it'll be good for me if I start letting him compliment me to help work on my issues. 

I found out he's pretty much an asshole. He puts on this caring, thoughtful demeanor to me but is rude as fuck with others. Something constantly didn't feel right: passive aggressive comments, whenever I called him out he immediately begged for an apology like throwing apologies to make the whole issue go away, sometimes I called him out on stuff that happened less than a minute ago and he'd deny he remembers it happening 

I said over and over a relationship won't happen and he held on and wouldn't listen to no. Upset with me if I tried tinder/dating apps, bringing up guys comments on Facebook. 

Sometimes I'd be mad at him and he'd have a meltdown and beg for reassurance from me because I can calm him down. 

Whenever I'd say about my past trauma he'd kept really drilling in ""I'm not that guy. I'm not that kind of person."" And it felt so sketchy for him to say that...it just doesn't feel right like do you have to go on about how you won't drive dangerously for me or won't hit me?

And then I majorly fucked up, I was drunk. He had a couple beers and we sexted. The entire experience was awful and I immediately regretted it. There was one point he ""accidently"" took a screenshot and I just feel sick... I told him afterwards that's never happening again and he wouldn't have it, he said ""if this is something we do as friends sometimes that'd be great"" 

Like, no, never again! 

Welp the next night, the very next night he hits on me. Denied he hit on me literally seconds after then sent me memes through other dms as if nothing happened. I was done. 

I told him I'm not comfortable us talking anymore, we can talk on the server but no more private conversations. Told him he broke a boundary etc 

Well he said he's leaving the server for 2 weeks to ""get over his feelings for me"". Left for 5 days then messaged me saying he needed someone, it seemed serious and he was just stressed about work. 

He then told me hes over me now and comes back. I don't comment. Things are chill in the server then he keeps fucking messaging me privately. I tell him to stop and he does 

Then a week later he says he needs to talk (I haven't blocked him as he's a major part of the group and server I own) and he's begging me to talk to him again, how he's so alone, he's been crying, he's knows he's fucked up beyond repair and he'll do anything. 

None of it feels real at this point...I've said over and over how uncomfortable I am around him, I don't want to talk to him and it just doesn't register...he doesn't care as long as I'm talking to him. He's at his worst 

I tell him I can't do this, I have absolutely no one to talk to about this issue either not wanting to expose what's going on to the rest of the group so I'm like ""wtf do I do?!"" 

I can't keep talking to him, it keeps feeding his delusion we'll be together...I tell him I can't do this and no I don't want to continue talking to him.

Him: really? I've honestly fucked it up that much? 

I realised he doesn't mean ANY of what he's saying...he keeps saying he ""fucked"" up and knows he's messed up expects me to be over it

He told me how he broke a boundary but because of my history with my abusive ex, that's why I feel disrespected...

My jaw dropped...he blamed my trauma from my abusive relationship and why I acting this way...not because he was a disrespectful creep 

He apologised but that was it. We don't speak outside the server 

Well after I reached out he went into my dms today saying he was here if he needed me etc etc all nice and calm 

I saw fucking red. 

I get frustrated, I get stressed, I get annoyed but I never get angry....last time I was angry was yelling at someone 4 years ago. I hide all my anger as much as I can 

But I was done

I said ""of course you do 🙃"" 

He said ""look I'm just trying to offer some reassurance here"" 

I told he's a shit liar and he just wants to talk to me again 

Him: ""I’m really not,Im literally just checking on you to see everything’s ok,I don’t want any more than that,Why would I put myself through all the stress of trying to put things right I already know I’ve done too much to fuck things up""

Me: You are so fucking manipulative

You are such a massive massive asshole

""I've already fucked up so much""

I'm so fucking done 

He was pretty shocked and told me to fuck off and he can't deal with me, I didn't respond and 5 minutes later he responded sorry and he was just shocked I called him manipulative 

I just wrote ""go fuck yourself"" 

Its petty as fuck, I could've handled it so much better but I am so fucking done 

All my fears...just went. I wasn't scared of him outting the screenshot he took to the group and making everyone know I'm a shit human being

I don't care, I'm just fucking done


**Mini edit: I welcome any and all advice (please tell me if I need to apologise asap), I'm also wondering If I should admit to someone else in the group what's happened but don't want to be a drama llama... and a huge thank you for reading too**"
Am I out of some kind of loop?,11,mjw94f,6,Why is everyone around me getting closer to each other and further and further from me? What is it about me that makes people just leave me out. Every time I predict something like this is going happen it does. I’m so sick of being right about people and yet so sad about being lonely. I want to be in the loop I want to belong but I can’t seem to make a real human connection to anyone. I’m literally important to no one. I am the connector. I bring people together and they leave me behind. My whole life will be spent like this. I’ll never belong or be loved.
best friend who knew i had bpd lied to me about...pretty much everything. lie after lie. after i put all of their trust into them. promised me all the shit they ended up lying about,2,mk6jk3,8,"i feel so disgusting. they hurt me and many others. they knew my biggest bpd triggers and put them against me. i hate them, but i hate myself even more. i feel so stupid"
Does anyone else genuinely hate themselves?,26,mjs74c,31,"I'm in general a pretty positive person, if someone has problems in trying to help the best I can and even if someone's acting like an ass I can defuse the situation or talk him out of that state.
However, I lately realized I don't feel the same way about me at all. There are of course people I don't get along with, people I wouldn't wanna speak with even if I get threatened with violence but the only time i feel so much genuine hate inside of me is whenever I'm picturing myself in front of me. It's one of the single strongest feelings I've ever felt and by times even crippling.
Anyone else got that problem and if so does any one of you have advice on how to deal with it?
Edit: grammar"
"sudden, intense, blinding anger that comes on suddenly from small triggers that literally make me dizzy",49,mjp2x7,11,i don’t know if anybody else gets this. maybe it’s because of the medication i’m on?? i’m on lamictal 300 and the side effects hit me hard. something as small as someone saying something that gets on my nerves can trigger an intense emotion that literally makes me dizzy from how intense and fast it came on. i never expect it. it only lasts a few seconds as well
F*ck it all.,3,mk3903,3,"It's happening. I've pushed him to the breaking point. 

You can never lie to me. Because I've already snooped, I already know the things you tried to hide. You lie. And blame me for snooping. Yep. Well. Oh well right. If you didn't have anything to hide I wouldn't have had to ask about them. And you wouldn't have lied. Either way it was doomed. 

It was a fucked up run and we only had a handful of good times. I'm never doing this again. Relationships are the fucking worst. 

I am the fucking worst."
My therapist is my FP,2,mk5q0g,4,"I've tried about eight different therapists in my life, but this has never happened to me before. My current therapist is the same age and at the same life stage as me and shares all of the same interests, even to the point of being eerily similar to me. We connected from the first session, and I feel like I'm in love with him. I think about him like 70% of the time no matter what I'm doing or where I am. I have detailed sexual fantasies and romantic fantasies about him, which makes me feel creepy, but I can't stop having these thoughts. I don't think I've shown him any indication of how I feel beyond platonic liking and appreciation. In one session, he described me as ""attractive"" (I don't think he crossed any professional boundaries, though, because it was in the context of something else rather than a direct compliment). The way he looks at me, though, my intuition is that he feels the same way. 

I'm conflicted because I know that these types of thoughts interfere with therapy, but at the same time he's helped me more than any other therapist so I don't want to stop seeing him. Bringing this up to him feels impossible. What should I do?"
Support groups??,6,mjynfm,1,"Does anyone know of any online support groups?

Does anybody else find most people extremely boring?,565,mj9ytt,80,"They can be super lovely people, very interesting in the “ordinary sense” but I’m still just super bored. 

There’s maybe only 2 people in my life I don’t find boring or struggle to keep a conversation with/flow. 

I manage it and just ask questions to get answers, so it’s not an issue with me being unable to communicate, I just find them and the interactions boring? Like I’d just rather not talk. 

Does anybody else struggle with this? 

Thankyou!!"
My FP is someone I had sex with one time who doesn’t care about me,3,mk2nff,4,"CW: sexual assault, suicide, self-harm

Basically over the past month I had to realize I got seriously sexually assaulted 4 times in my life already. 

The ONLY guy that has ever asked me for consent is my ex roommate who I had sex with ONCE. After this, eventhought some flirting happened beforehand,  he made it very clear he didn’t want more. It STINGS because the gremlin in my mind latched onto him like a baby monkey. 

For weeks after, I would obsess over every convo we had. I had nightmares of him killing or abandoning me or comitting suicide himself. Besides my “casual” nightmares about SA.

I nearly committed suicide over this guy. Multiple times. Because I had sex with hime, once.

When I FINALLY moved out, I was so relieved and it eased my mind SO much not to be around him anymore. Dealing with the shame of his rejection AND the SA traumas I was going through. The sheer panic I had everytime I had to go home to my parents and leave this guy.... Eventhough “being with him” meant sitting on the other side of the wall and maybe talking once or twice a day.

The other day I saw him again and for some reason my mind can not stop thinking about him, thinking we have some kind of connection. “That it must be something”. I told him about the SA and that its hard for me to be in my old house, and he said he felt sorry for me so “tHaT mUst meAn soMeThiNg riGht”.

And now I am home and life feels painful and useless because I can not be with him. And I feel like a loser because I am even thinking of being with him, eventhough I know rationally I dont want to. The chemical imbalance in my brain just makes me think I need this guy or I will pass away and it’s embarassing and it....

Hurts."
seeking a better understanding of anxious-avoidant attachment style in males w bpd,3,mk2k2q,1,"I (22F) have BPD & an anxious-insecure attachment style. I'm looking to understand more from the perspective of a male who has both BPD and an anxious-avoidant attachment style.  I'm hoping a better understanding can help me understand the distance/avoidance better to be able to give the proper support to someone I care a lot about. The questions I mainly have are like what goes through your mind during distance? Is the person you're splitting on on your mind at all? Is there anything they can do during that time? Is it painful for you during that time? If it is painful is there anything your loved one, friend, so, whatever it is can do for you in that time while you're blocking them out? even any reading recommendations on how you came to understand your own avoidant attachment style a loved one could read and understand a little better? i really want to be able to give this person love & support. insight appreciated"
heartache?,2,mk52uv,0,My mom just keep hurting me emotionally over and over again daily and neither of my parents were affectionate towards each other. My dad would slap me if he was frustrated and if I got B would say how come u didnt get an A and would yell at us when driving i feel like my sister got most of the brunt yet somehow was closer to him and now he is decased and my mom used to call me fat and has no idea when my spring break is and has not made anytime for me to go over things and wanted to cry today bc i just never felt loved or cared for by my parents yet i still try to talk to my mom etc but when i see her everytime she get annoyed or something and commets abotu my tattoos or my weight gain or clothes and keep cimoparing me to my past self and how it not her job to teach me how to do taxes or how i used ot be so pretty and used to do my makuep well and not anymore and she also would never stand up to my dad when he yell or somethign whcih is not a good role model i just cant wait to leave this shit small town and my house with my mom and sibling and maybe i do isolate mself and yeah im lonely as ever but happier alone  no one belive me i have BPD BUT THE proff is in hte pudding and worst part is people think my mom is freindly and too faced but she is not a great mother yet somehow loveds kid
Thing's are (kinda) looking up,2,mk4q0y,3,"3 weeks ago I attempted to take my own life. After I got fired in December my life went on a downwards spiral, but tomorrow I am starting a new job, I am worried because it's the same sort of work as I got fired from which is very stress enducing but I am going to give it my best shot, if it doesn't work out then it doesn't work out. Having a job will help bring some normality into my life and god knows I need the money haha.

I am on some medications which means I won't be able to drink for atleast 9 days, since October I have not gone longer than 7 days without a drink, so again I think this will be beneficial for me, and when the 9 days is up it will be a monday so with work I probably won't be drinking until that weekend anyway.

I was outside the other night and my FP (maybe ex FP idk how I feel yet) drove past, I didn't know he was back in town, I had a very breif meltdown, I was going to drink but I stopped myself because of the meds and I'm so glad I did because it would've made everything worse.

And that night I caught up with an old friend, I haven't seen him since something quite bad involving him happened, I was convinced I would sleep with him, I knew I didn't want that and I didn't sleep with him. He was there right before my downwards spiral began and has seen the major change in my life over the past 8 months and seeing him kinda just made me feel like myself again.

A guy I'm in a kind of messed up FWB situation with is going away for a few weeks, I think this will be good to help me sort out my feelings for him, after my suicide attempt we were meant to be giving each other space because he found a girl he has a connection with (he's going away to see her) but only 3 days later he came over and the only 3 times I've seen him since my attempt we've slept together and it's really clouding my judgement on how I feel about him, he also told me that he had been sleeping with other girls before my attempt when we were ""seeing each other"" which he had lied bc he told me he hadn't but knowing all these other girls want him makes me want him now haha.

I'm trying to hold a positive attitude as much as I can, I am sort of doing a 'fake it till I make it' type thing, but I really need to turn my life around because I am going down a very bad path, I'm trying my best to just accept things and let them play out."
"Need skills, or something, just anyone",1,mk8sze,7,I am in the ER RN because of a suicide attempt. And I just found out my girlfriend and FP cheated on me after swearing i was the only one she had eyes for and she loved me. She replaced my name on her Instagram bio with his. I just feel like my entire world is collapsing and i don't know what to do.
I’m trying to make a new friend,6,mjwv1j,4,"For as long as I can remember I have been struggling with having more than one relationship. Me and my boyfriend, my FP, have been in a relationship for two years and it’s been great but I’m so attached to our and only our relationship. 
But yesterday I challenged myself, I have this girl at work and we really get along. Conversations are never strained it just flows and I feel that she’s actually interesting. So I sent her a text suggesting we’ll hang out some time outside of work. She responded that she’ll be delighted and that I am a super nice person to be around. We also added each other on snap chat and I feel I somewhat made a new friend. Something that most of the times feels impossible to me. 

But fuck that, I challenged myself and I had a great outcome, I will continue to challenge myself and that horrid voice in my head that tells me I’m not worth shit."
Anyone ever feel like you've been pushing down so many bad past memories your brain can no longer remember the good or the bad memories?,3,mk0mwx,2,"Like I get that nobody remembers everything perfect but some days(being in a long distance relationship) I actually forget my boyfriends face and I have to look at photos to remember. Or Having a pretty decent conversation with my sister and remembering it was a good conversation but having no clue why because I don't remember anything we talked about.
So many times I just find myself forgetting everything and I'm terrified it's because I spent years suppressing the bad memories the good memories are now just kinda following."
Interested to hear from anyone (especially women) wirh co morbidity of ADD or ADHD,7,mjwcvx,6,"Hi everyone. Hope you are all doing as well as possible. I had an epiphany recently. My beautiful, vibrant and wonderful daughter has been partially diagnosed as having ADD. We are still going through the process of getting a full diagnosis but I am almost sure after doing my own digging, that yes she does present with most of the prerequisites for such a diagnosis. Interestingly enough, it seems that a lot of what she is experiencing was what I went through as a kid and I feel like I might have been living with ADD my whole freaking life without knowing. 
Obviously, my intention is for my daughter to get all the help she needs. She is super intelligent and I am so tired of hearing that if she were to stop being a dreamer and just focus... Blah blah. She isn't slow or stupid or unfocused or unmotivated, she is quiet (too quiet), shw has liw self esteem and is always down on herself for not being clever enough or extroverted or good enough ( all of which I know to be untrue) and it kills me that she feels alm this negativity toward herself. 
I feel like maybe, presenting with the same 'symptoms' as her as her, there would be some info regarding BPD and ADD co morbidity. There is a lot of info out there regarding co morbid symptoms but not a heck of a lot re adult females with BPD and ADD. If anyone could point me in the right direction or share their own experiences, I would be very grateful. 
Thanks in advance xx"
i think i have an FP and it’s killing me,1,mk78gh,3,"i have this really close friend who also has BPD and recently she came to my uni so we’ve been in close proximity for a while. we hooked up once in november and have made plans to do so again but nothing set in stone. we had feeling for each other in 2019 but it all kinda fizzled out to the friendship we have now. 

i’m trying to be understanding because she claims to be going through a hard time but she seems to have time for everyone else. 

at first, i thought i was just being sensitive cause in all fairness she was only posting snapchat’s with her uni friends after not being at uni for ages. but then the other day she posted pics of her and her friends on insta. and again i tried to chill. but then she posted a tiktok and now i’m so triggered. 

we haven’t spoken in over a month! i mean that’s more than enough time to cal someone back. i’ve basically called her everyday or every other day. 

we literally haven’t argued or anything. i just feel so abandoned and i thought she’d be more empathetic to that feeling cause she also has BPD but she just seems so distant and uninterested in me and it hurts. 

i never considered her my FP before but it’s just triggering trauma from my last FP relationship which is why i think it is. 

i’m so upset right now and have paragraphs to send but i don’t want to make a big deal of it cause she likely isn’t mad at me and i don’t want her to think i’m a baby who can’t handle myself — which i know she probably won’t but i can’t handle the possible negative reaction.  :("
Resources for managing BPD during pregnancy/child rearing?,2,mk2ugy,4,"Does anyone have any resources (books, podcasts, etc.) about having BPD while pregnant/raising children? Or any resources that they found particularly helpful?

I’m not planning on trying to conceive for another couple of years, but am actively thinking about how pregnancy and the early stages of child rearing will affect me. I’m planning on going through DBT skills again in the 6 months leading up to trying for a baby since I’ll have to get off of my meds and worry about a resurgence of some symptoms along with normal mood swings from hormones.

As it currently stands, my BPD is largely under control. I graduated from skills group nearly 5 years ago and take a mood stabilizer. There have been some ups and downs requiring me to return to therapy and I was recently prescribed another medication that I may or may not start taking (psychiatrist is leaving it up to me, which I appreciate), but overwhelmingly I manage my symptoms effectively when they pop up and have great interpersonal relationships with many people."
"I've Hit on 8/9 Symptoms Over the Past Week, But Have Come Out of it With a Greater Understanding of Splitting, and Working on the Tools",1,mk741t,1,"This turned out to be a long one - TL/DR at bottom.

My lady friend has been really helpful in really walking me through stuff, and helping me to understand the disease.

She's been staying with friends for a while, due to my last uhh, I guess it would be a ""period of intense depressed mood.""

The last argument we had was over something so trivial as well. A tiny misunderstanding on my part lead to me spiraling and ""splitting,"" I had asked her not to bother me about a certain thing.... And she wasn't.... But that's how I perceived it. 

So I went to a different room to try to lay down and cool off. She came in to try to help soothe me (great) but after a few attempts to explain herself I just went off on her, and hard. This lead to me sleeping in another room for the night.

We didn't really talk about it the next day, I don't know if that's either of our faults really but yeah, it's a huge mistake everytime. She went to her parents place to hang out the next morning.

Anyway, after brewing and ruminating on it alone for some while, I decided that it was time to turn to the other tool in my kit currently - Alcohol. And I lashed out, letting her know I'd be drunk when she came back, amongst a bunch of other shit.

This is when she left for her friends house - luckily I was already thrashed and sleeping when she returned to the place to grab some things.

The thrashing went on for a few days, passing out after finishing my supply, going to buy more, the whole time looking at the noose, I finally reached out to the boys and tried my hardest to not lash out at them, but still explain myself, and amazingly we made plans for a couple days out. So I figured I owed it to them, to see them and have a one more good time, ""last hurrah"" or what have you. 

My Mom came over around day 3-4 ish to stay the night and keep me safe, still all the while I was drunk. She fed me and everything, I love her to death. Sometimes we're not worthy yaknow? Cuz God knows I've split on her before.

And then, luckily right before my fun day with the boys, I had a psychiatrists appointment - and got to spill some real stuff to her about the past few days. Couldn't have timed that shit better, it was the most therapeutic visit I've had the whole time with this doctor. I'm always scared to open up about the suicidal thoughts though.

She doubled the dose on like everything, and added an anti alcohol medication for me. So after sucking down a few pints with the boys (not without me crying over it), picking up a couple 6 packs to tide me over for the pharmacy visit, I went home to drink and sleep, tomorrow would be a better day.

I've picked up my new meds now, and the alcohol ones have been doing some wonders tbh, I have had a couple urges, but later at night, instead of constantly throughout the day like I used to. I assume it's because I take the shit in the morning and it wears off.

The one thing - and she warned me - with the heavier dose of Prozac, I need to do it with food. Threw that shit straight up the second day cuz I didn't listen.

My girlfriend came over last night though, after I sobered up and adjusted my meds. We had a good chat. She said it was the best we'd had in years, before she went to go back to her friends house. I feel abandoned really, but I know shes coming back, because we're both committed to working on it. We'll be having dinner tonight.

Anyway, I hope the ramblings regarding my past week or so help you guys to maybe figure some shit out, or something, I'm not really sure why I wrote, but I sorta wrote my title to the post.

Sorry to mods if I've flaired the post the wrong way.

Thanks Everyone!

TL/DR:

The symptoms were a wild ride this week.

I understand that my tendency to split, or identify good deeds and wrong deeds as coming from separate entities (a good person, and a bad person), has been a major contributor to my wildly different interactions and thoughts regarding my love ones.  

I am taking small steps to make myself better there, and trying to not use absolute language when thinking of the  things that my loved ones do. And yay for trying to get back on the wagon.

Hoping this will lead to less angry outbursts, less abandonment issues by proxy."
Tired of feeling like the bad guy for having boundaries,2,mk2t7l,2,"My friends are currently all pissed at me for threatening to cut them off if they talk shit about me. They’re denying they aren’t shit talking me but I don’t believe them. They’re offended I don’t trust them. 

Why do people get so fucking offended if you don’t trust them? I don’t trust anyone! I don’t mean to sound like a 14 year old off tumblr but I probably trust my mom and that’s it. This is proving to me I shouldn’t trust you cause you’re calling ME the bad person for asking you to not crap talk me? 

Nobody gives a shit about people with BPD. My friends usually don’t see this side of me but I am splitting really hard right now and I feel like I hate all of them. I could just block them all right now but i’m trying to hold off. They act like they care but they don’t know the real me. They’ve already shown me they don’t like the real me considering how pissed they are after I had a BPD outburst for the first time. 

My friend even told me he thought my therapist was wrong the first time I told him i’m borderline. That’s how much I hide it usually. For this very reason. And now I’m going to be the one completely at blame for having emotions. 

I’m fucking pissed and tired of having to apologize for other people triggering me. If you didn’t trigger me I wouldn’t have said I want to cut you off. I told them many times without lashing out that I was hurt by the situation that’s been going on. I’m so frustrated. 

Also advice is welcome."
DAE wonder if they’ll be able to accomplish what they want out of life?,3,mk04yl,2,"I have been feeling that lately this disorder will cause me to be unable to do the things I want in life.
The other day my friend was telling me how he wants to become rich and how determined he is to make that happen... and see I would love that and I want that but anytime I start to look into the process and understanding where to start I get incredibly overwhelmed and then ultimately give up, telling myself I’ll never be able to do it.

I can barely keep a job or attend school without extra help, and on top of that the things I want to do in my future change constantly and I never know where I want to end up. I want things to be easy and just get rich without having to do any of the work, which I know sounds impractical but I get so overwhelmed at all of the “real world” stuff there is for me to learn after I graduate. 

I try to remind myself that there is nothing I can’t do and that the world can be anything I want it to be, but it feels like this disorder holds me back from so much and I don’t know how I will ever make a happy, wealthy living and life for myself because of it. Does anyone ever feel this way?"
I’m missing my FP who is my ex.,1,mk6zvz,3,My FP texted me today and I miss her already she probably texting her new bf and it’s making me really jealous and anxious. I can’t think of anything else but it.
DAE still live with their abusive parents because they can’t afford to move out?,6,mjwk3l,0,"I have been emotionally abused my entire life by my very own parents and I dread living with them every single day. I just can’t afford to move out, which is the problem here. I rather live anywhere than here. I would live with my grandparents if I could but they don’t have room."
i can NEVER be just moderately sad,52,mjl4qs,13,"something inconvenient happens? a perceived abandonment/insult? buckle up because my whole day is going to be spent SPIRALING, literally contemplating suicide or dramatic isolation. 

i wish, more than anything, i could say “oh that sucks” when something annoying happens, and continue about my day."
broke up w my bf Bc he called someone i don’t like,1,mk62rx,2,"I broke up with my bf/best friend last night when i was high. We’d been together since last June and had a fairly healthy relationship, but he did remain friends with an abusive ex-bf of mine for longer than he probably should have (he knew about the abuse). It’s worth noting he’s since cut off the guy and apologized to me for it. What led me to break up with him was a couple weeks ago he and I were on vacation and while we were having a night in he decided to leave the room to call his friend (f) who said some misogynistic things to me. They only talked for 20-30 minutes, and I hung out with his brother, but I haven’t been able to get over it. I was so happy with him before that, but after the call I haven’t been able to see him the same. I don’t know if I’m in an episode and I’ll regret this or not and none of my friends are answering me."
Can’t stop ruminating,4,mjvw3b,0,"A bit of background: So uncontrollable anger is not normally a symptom of my BPD. If any trace of anger wells up in me, I break down into tears instead. So the last couple years I’ve been working on feeling anger and uncovering repressed anger. It’s been a slow process, and a little bit on hiatus while I go through a pretty persistent depressive episode. 

Anyways. Something happened at work where I ended up in a yelling match. This person and I have never gotten along, but we’ve never yelled like that, and it was about something so trivial. It’s kind of a blur in my memory. I remember thinking to myself, “I’m not gonna back down, I’m gonna stand up for myself here.” Because I have a history of not being able to stand up for myself and in this situation I knew I wasn’t being unreasonable. But somehow it devolved wildly into a totally uncontrolled yelling match. I kept trying to bring it back around to grounded discussion but it was just impossible. I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve raised my voice at another person! 

So I left thinking I wanted to quit my job and everything was falling apart. I’m not used to feeling anger so it felt like the end of the world. I thought about how I’ve worked on expressing anger in therapy, and wished I had the props my therapist uses - a big foam block and a foam bat to hit the block with. In lieu of that I grabbed my ax and went into my backyard and chopped the fuck out of an old dead stump. I tried to give voice to my anger like how my therapist would guide me through the process if they would have been there. Then I went inside and cried. 

At first I felt really good about my efforts to feel and release my emotions in a healthy and intentional way. I guess I’m still proud of trying to use skills I’ve learned in therapy. But. I can’t stop ruminating. It’s been three days and every night I just loop through what happened. I can’t stop feeling ashamed for the things I said that were not emotionally intelligent in the heat of the moment. I can’t stop thinking about how I want that person to suffer, or how I feel bad for them because their life must be so miserable to behave like that. I think about facing them again and what I’ll say or not say. I think about how I can’t deal with this and it’s a reflection of everything else I can’t deal with and I should quit my job and run away. 

I hate that this person has taken up residence in my brain. They are not worth any more of my energy. 

I don’t see my therapist again for another four days and we have other important shit to talk about! I don’t even want to have to feel the need to bring this up in therapy at all! It’s so stupid! I just want to stop thinking about it. Howwwwwwwww"
i’m the worst person,2,mk0wu3,1,my mom and i had a very heated discussion which lead me to get really angry and i broke some things i regretted it but i was just so angry then my sister came in and it got even worse to the point she started kicking me and hurting me (i don’t blame her) she said i’m the reason everyone in this house is unhappy i got so mad i ran out of the house and i’m sitting at a bench crying and i hate this i hate this so much i cause pain to everyone around me i wanna move out so bad but i have no money no job nothing i don’t know what to do i don’t wanna keep ruining their lives anymore
How do I reach out?,1,mk57xe,2,"I don't really have any friends. I live with my family but I don't think they can help me ( they dont believe that there are middle grounds for mental illnesses, just you are either ""depressed and need help"" or ""normal and life is hard so deal with it"")(before you say to move out and live on my own, I did, I did go abroad for 3 to 2 different countries). 
I am not diagnosed with bpd yet, but this sub relates with me in so many levels than other mental health subs. Why not just consult a psychitrist? The local psychiatrist from where I lived only diagnosed me with ""imagining myself that I have some mental illness, that I found on internet"". 
I am currently 24. As long as I remember, no year went by without feeling lonely. Don't want to go on much details on that. Is it because my mind is clouded that I cant remember good stuffs? No. There were good stuffs. But most of the moments (good or bad) were just me all alone. So why am I desperately wanting a friend? Why cant I just be normal and accept my loneliness and build my self on my own? Is it because I am thinking that ""I cant do it?""
I could go months without talking to anyone except my parents (who care about me a lot in their own way.), which is also for a less than an hour every week, while I was abroad. 
How can I stop feeling lonely? I never had friends most of my life, so why am I feeling so lonely? 
Sadly there arent any dbt groups, therapists from where I live. Its expensive to live where there are therapists in my country and I cant afford it right now. 
I know most of you would think this as a joke, but thats alright. Maybe this is fake and I am just pretending, wasting my time writing all these. 


""Maybe I'll be your friend""  = gets bored of me before a week.
""I can help you"" = ""have you heard of Internal locus of control, where you stop blaming others and focus to solve problems on your own?""
""I wont ignore you"" = ghosts me for no reason. 
""You can tell me anything"" = only thing you know is complain 24/7
""Stop pushing people away"" = pushes me away.

Where can I get a friend? A friend who cares enough, not to ghost me. Someone who tries to understand me without rolling their eyes. I don't deserve human company, right?
(Bad english? not so sure why, language center is all messed up)
And yeh, this post wont make any sense to me within 6-8hrs. Feels bad enough to delete posts like these after sleep."
He's gone.,2,mk0nk6,2,"He's already 2 states away and didn't even tell me.

I just had him this morning. I woke up to him next to me. I had sex with him one more time. I kissed him one more time.

My FP is gone. And honestly I think he's deploying this summer so he is never coming back.

It hurts so bad. He means so much to me. I feel so empty and alone. Hes never coming back and I dont know what to do."
I’m tired of my attention-seeking behavior and feeling fake,31,mjn66q,7,"I am in extreme distress, but no one else sees it or believes it. Despite being professionally diagnosed with many disorders (in addition to BPD), none of these professionals seem to take me seriously. I have been told time and time again by everyone that I have not had “enough bad things” happen in my life to warrant my mental health issues; to be fair, I haven’t had any trauma aside from intense, long-term bullying during my childhood. As a result of this, I feel the need to “act out” and exaggerate to prove how much distress I’m in. It’s creating a vicious cycle.

Everyone seems to assume that I’m just looking for an excuse or looking for sympathy. I am trying so hard not to over-exaggerate my problems, but it’s hard not to when no one is taking me seriously when I’m being genuine. I don’t want to have to fake anything. I am genuinely in extreme distress every day of my life and it’s taking a toll on my life. In a way, I am looking for sympathy and being attention seeking, but it’s not out of malicious intent. 

I am so tired of not being taken seriously for everything I’m going through. I’m so tired for feeling like I’m faking everything for sympathy. I’m so tired of being a burden to myself and everyone around me. I’m tired of being exhausted because I can’t handle things or function as well as everyone around me. 

Note: while I did flair this as a vent, I am also looking for advice and support."
Love has lost meaning for me,5,mjv08g,10,"Like..when someone says ""I love you"" I just..don't feel it. It feels like just words. Deep inside I kinda just think to myself, ""Yeah sure you do."" sarcastically but I'll say it back and mean it with all my heart.

I do love others. I love others..way more than myself. Not to say I don't love myself. It's about a 50/50. Like I know I'm generally a good person, with talent, and I'm a hard worker and a really good friend, but..ever since my ex left me last year. I just..really can't find it in me to believe when someone says they love me anymore


Once again. It's just words out someone's mouth. It holds no weight to me. I acknowledge that they do, but the question then is ""for how long"". 

Another thing. I genuinely cannot find deep attraction in others ever since my ex. Like..I've slept with 5 different women since she left..I don't feel any spark. There's nothing that jumps out and makes me crush on anyone. It's like I want all the shit of a relationship, but without any of the titles or attachment. Like yes please cuddle me, kiss me, love on me, let me love on you, let's fuck, but..I never fall in love. I never get a crush. No one jumps out to me like my ex did. Like come on a stoner metalhead with childhood trauma isn't exactly hard to come across, but..my ex is the only stoner metalhead chick with childhood trauma that I want. I don't care to learn about anybody else. I don't care to get close like that to anyone else. I don't care to share my favorite color with someone. I don't want anyone relationship wise..aside from my ex (big shit show story behind her and I). Like I spend so much time honestly lonely and deprived of intimacy that it's all I crave, and whilst I'll happily take it from anybody, I also don't want to commit to anybody.


Like how tf does someone say ""Be my girlfriend without being my girlfriend.""? Like..treat me like a boyfriend (cuddles, kisses, hanging out, fucking, let's have pet names and shit, make cute memories) but you can just do whatever tf you want cause I can't commit."
Bpd and weed,1,mk42yp,22,"Hello fellow borderlines,

Currently furious at my partner for refusing to sleep???,1,mk419b,1,"My partner never sleeps and it gives my anxiety because obviously less sleep = more grumpy from anyone and it I’m currently sitting here enraged at him as he’s spent another 12 plus hours awake refusing to sleep and I want to do laundry but it’s a two person task and I feel like we can’t now due to his lack of sleep. I know I’m completely BPD spiraling but he’s gone out to get a tablet , played video games , cooked and all that all while his eyes are drooping and I’m just wanting to do the laundry and we always fight when he doesn’t sleep so I am too afraid to bring it up. He will claim he is fine and go anyways to prove a point and eventually his mood will wear on me . It’s just frustrating because if I stay up too late on a work night he’s nagging me about work in the morning but he can spend 12 plus hours straight awake and not even attempt to sleep . Laundry is a two person task because the Matt is far away and we walk and it’s too much for one person alone - I need him to be fully rested so we can get it all done and now the day is half gone and he’s not even tried . I’ve tried politely to say he should go to sleep but he just isn’t listening and I’m getting angrier and angrier as I sit here doing my own chores but wanting the laundry to be done and knowing I cant handle the argument . If he would just go to sleep I would even sleep out the door with my own things so he doesn’t attempt to join me resulting in a quarrel because he is too over tired to do the work. But he won’t !!! Ugh"
BPD: Superpower or am I broken?,2,mjz6o2,8,"Yesterday, I was working my minimum wage retail job as per usual but it has been getting progressively busier each day. We were very understaffed, and I was the only one on the floor. There were so many people talking, horrible music on the radio, so many things to remember, and I felt like I couldn’t keep up with everything. I had to work the register and it was customer after customer - it never stopped. I couldn’t even catch my breath while standing still. I had to get them to sign this, give them this receipt, give them this pamphlet, maintain eye contact and good customer service, but also be able to swiftly move past each transaction. While working the register, I also had to straighten the floor, maintain fitting rooms, (remembering # of holds, # of items, # of people in line for the fitting room, etc.). I’ve never been great at math and having to juggle all of these numbers started to put me in a spiral. Bins of clothes were starting to stack up, our copies of the receipts were getting mixed up, and I kept forgetting to give them the damn pamphlet. I’m usually pretty good under pressure but this is different. I worked at Trader Joe’s for 2 1/2 years and that shit gets CRAZY during the holidays. Then again, that was 3 years ago... I’ve had a lot of substance abuse that has impacted my memory and threshold since then. Anyways, I was seeing & feeling every warning sign before a big burst. I was scared. I was in public, I was being watched, and I felt like I was set up to fail! I felt and still feel that it was humanly impossible to run that store ultimately by myself! The other two girls there (my managers) were buying inventory so they needed to stay behind the front. They kept barking at me to do this then this then “Hey can you check on ___?” and “Please open up reg” and blah, making me bounce around the entire store. I’m pretty used to that but I was the only one there to do pretty much everything!

Next thing I know, my heart is racing. My eyebrow is twitching and it’s making me want to punch myself in the face. I’m shaking so much that I keep dropping the coins when giving cash back (I even accidentally opened the nickels in the quarter slot :( sorry closers). I knew that it had reached my breaking point. Way past that point. At any minute, I could have an embarrassing dissociative breakdown in the middle of my workplace. I reached over to one of my managers that I trust dearly, the other one is a c*nt from hell, and told her that I need to talk to her when she gets a minute. 35 minutes later, I finally tell her these words: “I can’t do this. I mentally and physically cannot do this. I don’t even know if I work, I don’t know what to do, I just really can’t do this” At this point, everything was really blurred and I could hear my ears ringing. I started tearing up and shaking even worse. She said “do you need to take a minute in the back?” A MINUTE? IM SORRY? What the fuck is 60 seconds going to do for my well-being right now?????? I said “I don’t know, I just can’t” I don’t know why these were the only things coming out of my mouth but whatever ... She requested that I stay until we found a cover or wait until the next person comes on. I agreed and told her I was fine doing that and it hurt even more knowing that if I left, I would be jeopardizing them. There I go again worrying about other people more than my own well-being... I stayed and I hovered near the register because that’s the only place I felt safe TBH. I told her that because of my disorder(s) and being neuro-divergent, I get overstimulated very quickly and more than just overstimulated. She took it as me being a bit dramatic and just anxious, saying she completely understands “exactly” how I feel but going home would put too much on the store. Next thing I know, my c*nt from hell manager comes to the front after being in the back for like 15 minutes. She left when I initially told my nice manager how I was feeling. At that time, evil manager was standing about 3 feet away from us, so she’d only be able to pick pieces of what she heard. She came to the front, hung up a phone, and approached me. She said, “So basically [boss’s name] said you need to go and you’re free to clock off, she’ll send you your last check in the mail.”

I froze. Am I being fired right now?

I said, “What? What do you mean?? What happens after I clock out?” and she responded with “When you leave the building, you are unemployed.”

I demanded I talked to our boss directly and that this doesn’t make any sense and she goes “She’s at a wedding right now, Mina.” Bitch you just got off of the phone?? You had time to discuss firing me but she doesn’t have time to come to me directly? Embarrassing and unprofessional.

Now I was trying to put the pieces together here. Who in the FUCK gave you the entitlement to take matters into your own hands (btw she’s not even a manager manager, she just has a key) to call our boss about MY situation that I didn’t even talk to you about?????? She called our boss upon hearsay, assumed that I was resigning when really I was in crisis, and next thing I know, i’m told to leave my keys and leave. I couldn’t believe it. I still can’t believe it. I’ve been up all night thinking about what I did wrong and I just don’t know. I couldn’t control myself deflating. I couldn’t control the panic. I tried every coping mechanism, planned to get a bite to eat on my lunch, (WHICH!!! I should have been sent on my lunch at 1 pm and my last punch was at 12:57) They really didn’t try to accommodate at all and sent me on my way. These people who I thought were my friends and who I thought recognized my solid work ethic and devotion to the team. Yeah only 12.25 an hour but it’s the only job I can have right now! I have bills to pay and a shelter to maintain. I have to feed and be fed. This absolute raging c*nt is 19, has everything handed to her, and is swiping on tinder with no shoes on behind the counter. I busted my ass to prove to our boss that I am capable of going into management, especially with my experience of being a long term manager at my past job.

I am in shock. My brain keeps being mean and trying to find reasons for why they jumped to that conclusion. I was just starting to get trained into management and upped my hours. At home, I’ll still think about work because I worry and worry. I rethink everything that I said that day, things I could have done better, and it sometimes impacts my already struggling relationship. I feel that this is somehow a blessing in disguise since I knew how deeply dissatisfied I was.

I’m still so angry. Anger is the emotion I have the biggest difficult with. I want to go back and beat the bitch up! Not only did she do me dirty here, but she has done me dirty each and every time I’ve worked with her, including embarrassing me in front of customers/co-workers. I keep reminding myself to find zen and that it’s not worth the energy but WTF ? Do I file for unemployment, make a claim, let go and move on? Or send pounds of animal feces to her door by an anonymous sender? Idk. I just need perspective on this and feedback and... help? I guess? Idk."
Bpd and one sided love,2,mjyxb6,1,"I am a diagnosed borderline, i was in love with a girl i am not sure if i am now or not thing is i end up texting her and end up hurting my self she does not love me she never did the thing which hurts me is she never cared it's been five years now i really want to move on but i can't last night i ended up texting her i texted her a lot of stuff and then ended up removing a few of them texts she replied and said that i should move on it hurt me like hell it was painful i should not have texted her i cried like hell it was so painful i am on medicine for last 6 months lamotrigine and olanzapine fluoxetine i have been stable for last two months but today i feel anxious it is hurting like hell idk what to do 😭😭😭 i want to hate her my chest is heavy today it hurts"

I guess this is more of a vent/ramble than anything else",2,mjymve,0,"Last night someone cancelled plans that we had made a month ago on me. I had been looking forward to this especially since it was going to be a combined belated birthday/end of passover dinner thing. I had already been having a very bad week to begin with and this was just icing on the cake. I kind of just had a breakdown. I don't really know what I was trying to accomplish with this, but I got to the point where I ended up taking a handful of excedrin (probably around like 15) BECAUSE I knew it wasn't enough to really do anything other than make me feel sick. For a long time now I've kind of just been in the belief of ""oh I'm fine on my own. I don't need help."" And I mean I know that along with other things I was doing last night was not okay, but I just can't bring myself to care. I'm not currently seeing any sort of professional, and I just turned 26 so I lost my insurance, but was having issues with insurance applications so I couldn't get any coverage for April, so even if I wanted to I can't really do anything about it until May 1st at the earliest."
Major insecurity in close friendships,1,mk2q4c,0,"Hi all, my first time posting here despite being a frequent viewer of the posts. I’ve never thought my situation was that bad that I’d have nowhere else to go but now is the moment where I feel like I can’t speak to any of my irls without damaging our friendship or their opinion of me. 

The situation has been something that’s bugging me for a while and I feel is completely irrational but the more it happens the less irrational my frustration at it becomes: I have a friend (we will call him Bobby/Robert) and since I’ve first met him I’ve always called him Bobby. He told me that he hates being called his full name and he asks everyone to call him Bobby. However that isn’t looking like the case, when I’ve met his other friends they’ve all called him Robert, his family calls him Robert, his colleagues call him Robert. It feels like the only person saying Bobby is me and I feel so stupid for it. It’s causing a major problem in our friendship to the point whenever we have a conversation where the subject of his full name comes up, I will get so distraught about the situation and we end up not talking for a few days because of my outburst. I just feel like I am being singled out and that Bobby does not view me as a friend because he will not accept my calling him Robert despite letting virtually everyone else in his life do it. 

Am I being totally unreasonably insecure and irrational about this or is the Bobby situation actually a little suspicious? Has anyone else had a situation where they are told that they can’t do something that everybody else seems to get away with doing? How can I deal with this in a way that doesn’t make Bobby freak out ?"
How can you get into a relationship?,1,mk2oeo,0,"I can't imagine myself getting into a relationship even though I really want one.
I've only had sexual relationships because I seek out emotionally unavailable guys. I really want a partner to love me for who I am but because I hate myself, when a man takes me seriously I don't believe him and run away.
I have a fwb right now who's starting to show me affection and I think I can imagine him being my boyfriend but he doesn't know I have bpd. I'm pretty sure he would take back everything and run away if he finds it out. 
I'm going to therapy but I just wanted to ask:

How do you cope with being frightened to lose your partner? How can you get into a relationship feeling like that? 

(btw sorry if I'm confusing, English is not my first language)"
My FP My husband left me,10,mjqd9t,6,"My husband and I planned to move to Australia. We sold our house and moved into a friend's Airbnb. We've been stuck in the house for a year by the way. When we get here we are both freaked out and fighting and he tells me he wants a divorce. He left me to go collect the rest of his stuff that's in a way another state 2 weeks ago. He'll be gone for a month and a half but will be back. Before he left he took all his stuff and put it in a different storage unit. 
I I'm freaking out so i went to a Psychiatrist he tells me I have BPD. Wtf? He's like without a doubt. I go to the therapist. Same thing. I've been married 17 years. I've held down a career for almost 20 years. And none of it matters. It all went to HELL. I'm in a run down fucked up cabin in the middle of nowhere, screaming crying losing my mind about to send in a letter excusing me from work for at least a month from the psychiatric hospital because I can't find baseline. I dropped my wallet thankfully it was found at security, my dog ran in the street I think I might have to leave him with a friend, every second every breath every moment is spent thinking about my husband. I can't sleep I can't eat I can't stop thinking about him. It's physically painful. I read about what an FP is. He is obviously mine. It makes me question everything about the reality of our relationship. It is absolutely soul shattering. I feel like if I look at it too hard I may end up breaking something in my head. I feel the most unstable I have felt since I was a kid and I am no kid by any means.
What do i do? It's not getting easier like everybody tells me or what should be happening.

how to deal with recovery plateaus? (TW suicide/self harm),3,mjvlqw,3,"trigger warning: mentions of suicide & send harm.

context: i was diagnosed with bpd in 2015. i started dbt (group + individual) in september 2019, stopped in march 2020 due to being laid off both my jobs. restarted with the same therapist in january of 2021, gonna start group here soon as well. 

the past month has been brutal emotionally. i went to the hospital two weeks ago after relapsing with self harm and suicidal ideation. i’ve just been a mess. 

i feel like i’m hitting a plateau with my progress. i feel like i’m barely surviving right now, and i’m frustrated with that. have any of you guys experienced this, and what did you do to push through it?

abandonment complex vs. actual abandonment,7,mjrwns,1,"i feel like my fp has fallen out of love with me.

normally i convince myself that people are leaving me, and i work to convince myself that someone would never stay. i avoid feeling alone by never letting myself rely one someone's company. 

but in this case i am worried that i am convincing myself to stay with someone. that the signs are there, and i am avoiding alone-ness by keeping someone's company when really it would be healthier to not rely on them, emotionally.

i am so disregulated. i offer people prizes to love me and when i stop giving the prizes and expect me to be enough, they stop seeing the shimmer of it and i am the asshole for not being what was advertised. 

what? emotionally vulnerable? i hate hearing ""this isn't what i signed up for."" so i have to be the standard? not even me - but me being desirable? 

how do i know? it stops feeling real after a while."
I’m tired of this empathy...,11,mjq1nm,3,"I am filled with so much empathy, it hurts. I don’t feel anything for myself anymore. I wish I could be my own person.... I wish I didn’t feel everyone else’s pain at such a deep level. Because no one.... no one ever feels mine. I’m all alone in this."
My partner's past is driving me crazy.,1,mk15q1,5,"I feel like its been nonstop panic. We met 2 years before seeing each other again, they stopped talking to me to get back with their ex. They moved away and broke up with that person for another. Then broke up and had a wild 6 months and saw a lot of people. They lied about the number, who they slept with, and what happened right before we started dating, up to a couple of days in fact.  

Told me they didn't sleep with people that they did sleep with, on multiple different occasions. the worst part was lying about their body count, they told me it was 8 which is much higher than they had led me to believe since i was number 3 when we first met (i lost my virginity that time, and only slept with one other person). then 2 years later said ""i lied it's actually 12"" because ""I specifically remember counting with my friend"" then went back to ""i must have counted wrong it was 8"" I found all this out because I was stalking their profile and their past and everything.I was told so many times ""there's nothing else"" or being blamed for being upset. all, in the end, to find out i was right and they were lying.

I feel completely irrational but I cant stop obsessing over it. ""who else was there"" what else aren't they telling me. we've been together for 7 years and i don't see a world with my partner. but I constantly obsess over these thoughts and it is driving me crazy. we talk about it but it never helps. I want to just have full trust again but it's so hard to do that and feels like i may never get there. Im so scared that ill never be able to let go of this shit.  don't want that, I want it to be better. 

Sorry for the long rant. I just wanted to get all of this out. Please don't tell me I'm being irrational because rational is not really a word I work well with.

he follows a really beautiful girl, they follow each other. she’s a model— i model. but she does a lot more than me. she looks so cool. i compared immediately, and now it’s making me want to split. i really don’t want to, cause being with him feels so good— but i can’t suffer through the same things i did last time. i don’t know what to do. what do i do..."
Maybe I'll never get better.,1,mk0vec,2,"I went to my first bpd support group and one person has been diagnosed 15 years ago and therapy didn't really work for them (DBT) neither did medication and they never went into remission, they just became worse. And I worry I'll end up like that, I'll never get better or whatever that means. I don't feel like anything can take away the fear of abandonment, chronic emptiness and all the behaviours and thinking patterns associated with BPD. I feel like all that stuff I read about how lots of people with bpd get better is all a lie. The bpd will just continue destroying my life until the end comes."
i have no friends and i feel like it inevitable that im going to be lonely forever (tw for suicidal thoughts),12,mjnp7u,4,"(kind of a vent but i want advice and support) 

i have lost my only friend (well not really but she is embarrassed to be seen with me and doesnt show interest in me anymore also she is my fp) and now i have no friends, no close family members, nothing but my pet dog im still young so im trying to hang on until college to see if theres a possibility that i might make a friend there but i feel like its stupid for me to think that someone will want to be friends with me considering i have bpd and social anxiety so im really awkward. my biggest fear is being lonely and i have to face that fear every second im alive and it's unbearable. if anyone else who struggles with bpd and/or social anxiety has any advice for making friends please let me know because i dont know what to do anymore i literally cannot fathom an independent life with no friends nor do i want to become an independent person. is it inevitable that im going to be lonely if i stick around just waiting for someone to magically come along? i NEED to make a friend desperately but have no idea how too because im currently being homeschooled and too scared to go back to irl school, i have terrible social skills due to being lonely and barely ever speaking for my entire childhood due to bullying and being emotionally neglected and abused at home. i feel really hopeless right now and cannot picture any kind of future :/ any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙏"
I want to die. Tw ig,8,mjpkzk,12,"Plain and simple. I want to die. Idgaf about the stupid suicide hotline that gets posted. I want to die so bad. I cant do this anymore. Im a fucking idiot. No one has ever actually cared about me.

Im just laying here praying something kills me."
Any experience with accutane?,1,mjzd7n,1,"I was aware of many potential side effects going into starting accutane 3 weeks ago, but figured they’d be mostly physical and not mental. Sure as shit, with my amazing luck and neurochemistry, my thoughts of self harm and suicide have boosted to a degree that I’m not sure I can ignore. I hate it because it’s already working so well on my acne, which makes me feel terrible. 

I’ve read studies regarding a 20% reduction in brain activity in a cortex which is correlated to depression when activity is lower. Wondering if that means for us borderlines who are not clinically depressed, if perhaps our depressive episodes become worst and the suicidal ideation is exasperated. 

What was your experience with accutane?"
I feel more sane when I’m on my period and crazier when I’m not on it,8,mjox9l,4,"It’s like reverse PMS. It clearly seems hormonal, but I hate it and when I try to explain it I don’t think others understand. My mom said she notices it too that on my period I’m so rational and level headed and calm but the moment it ends I’m like angry and anxious and constantly picking fights."
Bestfriend split on me like a month and a half ago yesterday she texted me saying ‘sorry for hurting u’,1,mjyxrw,1,"This text came out of nowhere after basically low/no contact since the split I texted her back told her it was okay and that I still love her the same and will never give up on her. I told her I understand splitting is part of her survival instincts and I never blame her. I told her I would never be able to replace her in my heart.


I feel so bad for her I hope she’s not feeling guilty, do you think there’s a chance to fix our friendship especially if she is texting me now."
I need a reality check but I don't want to ask anyone I know so I don't come off too intense,1,mjytxb,0,"I'm doing my best to like...act normal and not let other people see my anxiety but I just feel like I still need advice sometimes and idk who to ask that it won't overburden them or come off as weird or too intense.

I started hanging out regularly with a friend of mine who is very well adjusted, I like her a lot,we started taking walks weekly. I introduced her to another friend and they get along really well, which is great. But last week we all decided to take a small hike and I couldn't do it, like it kicked my ass and it was awful and embarrassing. I'm just all effed up because of depression and covid and whatever. So now I'm kinda concerned they will start hanging out without me. Like I think the normal person thing to do would be to be chill about that and be like ""yeah cool sure catch you next time"" or something. But I am super paranoid they are gonna abandon me and I'm trying not to be weird or let that show but I have the weird goth 90s kid thing where instead of being ok or just totally blabbering about how I'm afraid they're gonna leave me, I just kinda vaguely make funny jokes and pretend I'm fine. 

Like...I think I'm overreacting and being afraid that they will stop hanging out with me because I'm a burden or out of shape or whatever ...but it also just feels really inevitable that everyone will leave me because I suck. That always happens. People always leave. I get along with friends one on one but then when I introduced them they either hate each other or get along so well I get cut out of the picture because it becomes so obvious how much of a weirdo I am. 

What do. If I say anything, it's going to come across as insane ranting, but if I say nothing I know they will just feel my anxious vibe and I'm gonna be paranoid. If I avoid them, it's a self fulfilling prophecy. If I was emotionally stable I could take control of the social interactions by suggesting outings or somehow being more competent, but I'm just not dude. I'm a broken ass toy trying to pretend not to be. Gehhhhhh...."
It all makes so much sense,3,mjv01g,1,"I’m a 25 y/o make, For the second time in my life I have ruined a great relationship with a great love of my life. I’ve learned that this person would be called my “Favorite Person”. I’ve been wondering what was “wrong” with me because it always feels like I try so hard but it’s never enough, and when I lose control, or I think “split” is the correct terms, I get very violent. I never hurt people physically, always walls and tv’s and objects, I destroy things. I feel trapped in my own body, cognizant but not in control. I’ve been reading on BPD, and it all fits. It makes me feel so good to know I’m not the only one who is like this. It feels so good to have a name. I’m not diagnosed, but I’m going to talk to my therapist Saturday about it. Any advice about how to bring it up to my therapist? Or any advice at all?"
Advice on dealing with/getting over obsessive crushes?,2,mjujrs,2,"i’ve only ever had a few in person crushes and that is purely because as soon as i attach myself to that person, the feelings don’t seem to go away. they last for a solid few years or until it gets to where i’m not seeing them often (like changing schools and not seeing them in class anymore). 

over covid time though, this changed. instead of attaching myself to one person, as soon as i felt any romantic feelings for someone, it was an instant ghosting and ignoring of any messages from them. i basically pretended they didn’t exist. it wasn’t healthy but it worked, yet now that i’m back in college, being faced with romantic feelings for someone is hitting me so much harder and i honestly feel like i’m going crazy.

there’s this guy in my law class and although i act completely normal around him, i feel myself almost obsessing? i don’t stalk his accounts or anything, more i’m constantly thinking about him. my mood drastically changes depending on how i think he views me. right now i feel so anxious and genuinely hate myself purely because i’ve convinced myself he was only pretending to like me. i feel like i’m going through hell and don’t know what to do. i’ve become friends with this guy and don’t want to end up hating him or pretending he doesn’t exist because i’m convinced he hates me or think it will save me from getting hurt. i’ve also already started having some intrusive thoughts about him and i’m scared they’re going to escalate. 

does anyone else have advice on dealing with this sort of stuff? like how to get over crushes or cope with them in a way that doesn’t make them feel like they’re controlling my life?

edit: i don’t want a relationship right now, i’m genuinely not in the right headspace for one so admitting any feelings seems unfair to the guy."
BPD and Good Things!,6,mjqtic,2,"Hey!  
Aside from our BPD downs and struggles, what are some things you're proud about at this very moment?  
Maybe anyone's got some new achievements? Ate their breakfast this morning? Blocked their episode before it started? Did something new? Anything? :)  
Let's remember and point out all the good things here! Even the little things, so we can all learn to recognize even the smallest progress!"
I screwed myself over....again..,5,mjqjki,4,"So I was six months clean of self harm after my last favorite person leaving sent me over the edge and threw me into a mental hospital. Then I start talking to this guy because he followed me on insta and alot of my friends are friends with him. So then boom ten minutes into our first convo my brain was like “You love him and also he’s your favorite person.” So then he found out pretty quickly because Im really bad at hiding my emotions for people and he asked me “hey do you love me?” And instead of lying I was like “yes” and we discussed that he wasnt interested in that kind of relationship that we would just stay friends. Well then boom, I realize hey he doesnt talk to me much anymore, and he also seems not interested when we do talk so I should probably ask him about it. And everytime I asked he was like “no its okay, Im just busy.” And for some reason my dumbass believed him??? So then That leads to quite a few self harm relapses and feeling like Im the worst person to ever exist. And then today I thought about attempting again and my friend talked me out of it and convinced me mine and his relationship was unhealthy so I needed to stop being his friend. And so I did and then he was like “Yeah youre just too intense.” And LIKE FUCK I TOLD YOU I HAVE BPD AND THAT YOURE MY FAVORITE PERSON WHAT DO YOU EXPECT??? But yeah so thats how I sabotaged yet another relationship with someone because Im awful and shouldnt be on earth."
Quiet bpd with a shitty family,1,mjxk0x,3,"So I'm 19 and live at home with my mother and 29 yo sister, they both posses a plethora of narcissistic traits that over time has led me to go low contact/no contact with both of them but because I still live at home it's practically impossible to go anywhere in the house without either one of them breaking this boundary I set using a hoovering tactic or scapegoating/blameshifting which only makes me feel worse about who I am and how I feel about how they treat me. I'm not too strapped for cash for food so I don't rely on them for groceries but until I have enough money to leave I'm constantly stuck in this constant inner turmoil of ""do I engage in this frivolous confrontation for the false sense of hope that my family actually cares about me, or do I ignore the invites for ""open"" discussion and allow myself to be berated even more than I already am simply for standing up for myself.""
It constantly feels like I'm making the wrong decisions but I know I can't go back to a family that abuses me then resents me when I speak up about said abuse, it feels like I'm losing my mind. It's like when I speak up about how I feel in accordance to the way they treat me, they no longer understand English. All in all there's nothing I can do so I'm just gonna sit here for as long as it plays out but it's been like this for maybe 2 years now lmao"
will someone ever love us as much as we love them?,99,mj7usi,63,"i feel like (and know) i am more into my boyfriend than he is into me. i know he likes me a lot, but its with the small things i can just tell it isnt as much as i love him. is this bad?? is this how i’ll always feel?"
bpd relationship with the love of my life,1,mjwgwz,2,"i met my lover a year and a half ago but we know our love is unlike any other. We’re now 19/20 but we promised each other unconditional love for life, and we have a special bond that is truly magic. Earlier this year around 7 months ago he struggled mentally a lot and a cycle of pushing me away / hurting my feelings started on a regular basis - but I learnt then that Love encapsulates everything about somebody else all the ups and the downs and that I would sacrifice certain things happily for this love to exist. To sum it up quickly I know he has a history of childhood trauma, led him to rely only on himself and cut off everyone else very easily if ever disappointed + went on antidepressants for a bit after getting diagnosed with clinical depression earlier in his teens, and now I was the only one with his family to be unconditionally loving and caring for him. I love him so extraordinarily much, and I know he does too, he warned me that when he pushes me away so violently i should know it’s not him. 
So i want to fight for this Love, for him by any means.
He broke up with me last week by falsely accusing me of cheating, saying he wants me to hate him, and ever since blocked me from all ways of communicating with him, unfollowed me from everywhere, in sum he erased me from his present life. I truly believe our Love is meant to be, and although it’ll be difficult we can overcome it if I get him to see a therapist. It’s always hard to talk about his mental health - let alone now that he sees me as his enemy and never wants to see me again.. i’ve told him i really am hurting / self harming and he has been completely indifferent, ghosting me. It’s extra tough on me but it’s nothing compared to what I believe the pain he is now. We never talked about bpd/ he never got diagnosed but i read into it this year and it fits perfectly who he has been.
We have been in long distance alternatively for almost a year since Corona now and we will keep on being it next year, which justifies why he gave up on all these efforts.  I don’t want to give up on him so I booked a train to see him next week and although I’m pretty sure he is gonna refuse to see me and I’ll go back home without having seen him, I need to show him I truly love him...

Anyways this realization that the love of my life is pathologically pushing me away and making it so hard is really fucking me up unlike anything I’ve ever lived in my Life. 
I really need help from people who have positive experiences of bpd relationships because I know on my life God put us together for a reason..."
"The lack of utility in the term ""Borderline Personality Disorder""",0,mjw93m,2,"There seems to be an emotional disconnection between what I feel and what I think of as ""BPD."" Saying ""I have BPD"" or that I suffer from it aren't guttural statements that I know to be true as I'm saying them. It's like saying a triangle has 3 sides, it's just kinda true because we agree that it's true.  


I think the terms BPD and Borderline Personality Disorder take away something as they attempt to describe sufferers and the condition. To me, BPD is a very vacuous and empty term and there will not be a guttural punch to it because it was designed clinically and not ""for humans in the real world"", for lack of a better term.  


Before our modern era, (some or most) people didn't use to think of the world conceptually as a place of things. They used to think of it as a place of action or meaning. The world would consist of that which you could interact with and what effect it would have on your life. (Maybe a reason as to why people were more easily religious, as religion could be seen as having an effect on their life and thus more real?) To think of a BPD sufferer existing in an era like this, I would think that these people would have described it differently. They might've said that a sufferer had gone through certain trials/tribulations or had been lacking something in their early life and thus now is affected by this experience. To me, this is a more useful (at least in my day to day) way of thinking about BPD. A series of cause and effect, essentially. For me and my head, it can be hard to fit how my personality has been morphed, how my ""traumas"" have formed my fears and strengths, and how these affect my moment to moment thinking into... ""BPD."" It seems much easier to imagine that because I had a toxic, selfish family environment without a positive male influence and thoroughly negative feminine personalities instead, that I turned out like I did. This leads to this which leads to this and ends up here.  


Besides being the thousandth thought experiment I've run today, I believe this could be a more helpful way of viewing the disorder since when I think of BPD purely clinically and as DBT as purely ""the thing I should say/do"", it all sorta loses it's kick whereas my emotions get that extra persuasive edge of being closer to the human experience than something like the terms of ""BPD"" or ""DBT."" And while I understand that we shouldn't lower everything to the base level of emotions as people who suffer from an emotional disregulatory disorder, I don't think that means we have to act as if emotions themselves are simply a phantom phenomenon. Humans do exist on a level of reality where things have meaning and if they mean nothing, then they are worth nothing. Even if more modern minds wish to be purely objective, rational, and detached."
I just watched 'Ingrid Goes West' and now I feel kinda weird,3,mjrfqw,1,"hey guys,

(I'm 21 with bpd.)

this movie was not THAT big of a hit (at least in my country) so I'm gonna write some info about it: Ingrid Goes West is a 2017 comedy-drama movie with the goddess Aubrey Plaza in the main role, and with other stars like Elizabeth Olsen and O'Shea Jackson Jr.

in the movie Aubrey's character (Ingrid) is a mentally ill young woman, who's very lonely, basically she has noone and her mother just died recently. she starts browsing social media (Instagram) a lot and find influencers who she thinks are cool and try to become friends with them. but not in the healthy way. because it's clear in the movie that she does not know how she should approach them in a healthy way. so she starts writing notes about her idol's life and then basically she just starts stalking her in real life, she bumps into her ""randomly"" and try to become friends with her, then they became friends, in her house she takes pictures of everything just to copy those in her life and to make sure that they are alike so she will love her for sure. then of course lies come out plus her favorite person becomes friends with other people and she just can't handle it.

watching this movie made me realize that I'm... basically Ingrid.?? I mean I have noone and I don't have any idea how to make healthy friendships, when I ""pick"" someone I want to ""own"" them and I don't want them to have other people in their life and that's very creepy and unhealthy. plus I literally did the same as Ingrid... I followed people on Instagram and tried to become friends with them but I had no idea how that works?? so I just wrote weird stuff to them and some of them blocked me but once I asked a Russian girl who was on holiday in my country if she wants to hang out with me, and she said yes, so we met once and hung out a bit, then I started learning Russian and became obsessed with her and Russia and decided that I'm gonna move to Moscow just to impress her and see her daily or idk??? then I saw on her IG story that she has other friends and then I was disappointed and basically just give up on my plans..

so yes, I'm not sure you guys care about this stuff but I just wanted to share it somewhere so here it is.."
It’s been a long time,2,mjswq1,0,"My bpd has been really out of control and my impulsiveness been making me do or think about things I wouldn’t normally consider.

I used to self harm when I was younger and the last time I have done it was in 2017. Lately I have been so confused with how I feel to the point of feeling like my bpd is winning.. 

I recently bought myself a semi colon necklace to remind myself of how far I came with my mental health but my mind kept pushing me to do it almost as if I “missed” the feeling of doing it even though I felt the fear of thinking about it.. but it has convinced me so good that after 4 years of not doing it, today I have self harmed myself..

I am so sorry.."
BPD and Career!,3,mjr3sh,6,"Hey!  
For my whole life, I've always had a question to myself at the back of my head, what career would best suit me and my abilities/skills?  
Because of my BPD and mood swings, I've never been able to answer this question, because I've still got a lot to learn about my BPD and how to control it, so it doesn't get in my way on daily bases and I'd be able to create a nice future for myself and choose the things, that best suit me.   
I've noticed a lot of people with BPD are very creative, but then again that's for each person individually.  
I'd like to know, what careers have you thought about or maybe already have chosen one, that seems the best for you?  
Maybe you have something to add about a job, that was the opposite from good to you and what type of job was it and why it wasn't for you?"
I think I have BPD and this sub make me feel less alone.,47,mja55l,11,"Hi everyone
I only make this post to express myself
I'm (F 20y.o) from France, it's hard for me to talk in english but I'll try my best.. I've been struggling my all life with mental health like anorexia nervosa and bulimia, ED in general but with anxiety and depression.
I'm in my second year in psychology at university, mounts ago we saw personality disorder. My depression became worst at this time, but I started to be able to describe more precisely my symptoms. I started to see a psychiatrist and a psychologist, they diagnose me a depression (not surprised) and dissociative disorder. But I know that there's something else and everyday I discover some things that I forgot and the list goes on..
But when I see your sub I feel like everyone knows what it feel like everyday to live..?"

Sickening low self-esteem (tw: suicide),4,mjnoxq,7,"\*Not looking for advice, although encouragement, relating, and personal anecdotes or shares are welcome\*

Hey everyone. I have been doing awful lately. I think that I am weak to my severe depression. I often think why haven't I killed myself yet. Writing those words definitely hurts me..but..honestly I question whether I will ever be someone who realizes her goals and lives a fruitful life. You need motivation, discipline, and good mental health for that. Folks I am losing the battle and have struggled and suffered for years now. Do I just accept that I am going to live a crappy life? It's up to me to be happy and make the changes that  I need to make but I won't or can't. But living a crappy life feels so bad. Going from ""meh I'm used to it"" to ""Fuck I can't take this anymore!! I need to make a change, NOW!!"" but still not being able to. And I do put myself down for that all the time. For being weak. For being too scared to make a change. For thinking it is too hard to take action. Too hard to successfully change my diet, too hard to hold down a meaningless job in late-stage capitalism. 

Everything is too hard. First off I wake up and get hit with the hard reality living with this illness and how shitty life is and has been. It takes hours for me build up the motivation to do something. Today was doing laundry. And that task was motivated by the anxiety and pressure of needing to do it. Is this going to be my life every day? Only completing one task and being like ""welp, that's enough for today."" How the hell can I get anywhere in my life living like that?

My main point of this post and how I feel is that I feel too weak to this illness. That I feel like life is too hard, and blaming myself for how hard life is (after all, it's my negative thoughts right?) In this life, it is required of me to force myself to do the basic necessities to exist. But I don't want to. I want my dreams and desires to arrive at my doorstep. That's why I often think about suicide. I obviously don't want to put in the effort it takes to bring about positive change (plus I have already tried so hard for years to change my mental illness around), and because of that and because I fail I should therefore kill myself. I'm living a passive death anyways. But I know suicide isn't the answer, and I wouldn't be successful. 

Please I just want life to be easier. If I wasn't at the mercy of my severe depression I think I could live a decent life. But I haven't learned how to manage my depression, how to beat it, and so..I'm just failing at life and suffering every day."
"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just the replacement of one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""",805,miwc67,51,"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

I know the stigma attached to Borderlines in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. And it's the BPD lot who need it the most.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.


*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**"
Last minute plans,36,mjba7q,15,"Do last minute plans freak anyone else out? I made plans for the day, mostly just to hang out with my pup alone. I’ve been around a lot of people the last week and being 100% alone feels right. My best friend just invited herself over and internally I’m freaking out. Mostly
because I have had to explain to her a million and one times that I don’t like doing things like this and it’s like she doesn’t listen. 

I’m even worse at saying no so now it’s like I have to really change nothing but everything about my day so she can come over. Is my
room clean enough? Should I wear socks? Put lotion on? I have no groceries yet what if she gets hungry and wants to go out to eat? I don’t wanna do that??? THIS is why it’s so hard for me to switch up my day. My brain goes into overdrive."
Sinking in,5,mjmru7,6,"When I was a kid, you were the biggest star in my eyes. You were my crush; I watched all of your videos. I looked deeper into your profile to understand you more. As the years went by, I was really invested in your work and your world from a computer screen. I dated someone in high school and put away that ridiculous crush. The high school relationship ended (as most of them do) and I went back to the obsession. I found a way to contact you. You answered back! It was incredible! I had just turned into an adult months prior. Finally, we were going to meet up after talking for a while over the phone. It was the scariest experience of my life. I’ve never been the type to sneak out, but I did it for you, and myself. I wanted to feel freedom and excitement. You were 3 hours away. It was a LONG drive. I pulled up to your driveway after midnight, sweating and shaking with nerves. You tapped on widow for me to come in, and the rest of that night felt like a fever dream. A few more visits passed by and I got to meet the real you. I asked you not to do what you did, many times beforehand. I was facing away from you. I begged you to stop. You hit me in the face and it was that moment I realize this was a grown man who’s doubled my size, and I was really in trouble. I fought, cried, and blood was everywhere, dripping down my legs, in the cracks of my toes. I smeared the blood from my legs to my fingers and shined it in the bathroom light so you could see. “Look what you did to me”. My face was hot, felt like my tears had turned into steam, which pushed back into my eyes. You just kept laughing. I was in a place I shouldn’t have been in. I wasn’t supposed to be there, no one knew where I was. It was beyond too late to get out of there, and I wasn’t supposed to be in a certain place until the next morning. My head was pounding from the pain. I felt that my insides had torn, almost to the point where I was afraid a doctor would have to be involved and the police would’ve been called. Even after this you still took advantage and had some fun for yourself. The next morning you gave me breakfast and kissed me goodbye. My emotions swapped from extremely scared to forgiving. 2 weeks had passed by, I watched your video and you had told that awful moment to 200,000+ people. Granted, you didn’t use my name, but strangely during those 2 weeks, my mind went blank of the incident. I even messaged you and said it was a funny story. The physical bleeding pain took 5 days to get over. Now and then the act would appear in my mind, but I would quickly cancel it out. It took a real friend, (not the friend I had told before, who only laughed, glancing over what I had said to think the whole thing was just a kink I was into) to point out that I was wronged. Everyone in the video was laughing, the comments were laughing, and comments asking questions, “Why would some girl allow that to happened? Jesus! this guy hooks up with straight-up whores” the crazy part is I still see you. Maybe this is an attempt to convince me, what happened wasn’t a waste. That maybe there are good times to come. Only a few times did I enjoy myself. I’m in a constant cycle, I need to leave, but my brain doesn’t want me to go. I’m trapped in my mind. I want to be free from everyone. I want to let people know, that’s why I’m writing this, but I can’t have my family involved. I don’t want my true identity out there. 

Please protect yourself, please don’t do what I did. Never. Meet. Your. Heroes. 

They can be monsters"
Does anyone else find their emotions intensified?,8,mjjz5r,3,"As the title says. Honestly, it feels as if my emotiona are intensified by so much. If I'm mad, I get very mad, sad I get extremely depressed, etc, etc. If I'm being honest, and as negative as it may be, I tend to shut off any and all emotions because of it. It sucks, but I'd rather be a blank slate than extremely angered, sad, or whatever else there may be."
How do you handle the feeling of emptiness?,10,mjigo2,2,"I often feel empty and purposeless, like there is nothing to look forward to. I feel a dissatisfaction with life. I guess it is hard to put into words how I often feel but emptiness has a lot to do with it."
Just got officially diagnosed,28,mjbohu,9,"I got officially diagnosed today, and honestly i feel weird... because i always knew it was more than anxiety and depression, but i was never sure. Well i got it today and i feell.. relieved.. like i’m not crazy, i went thru some shit growing up and it has always affected all my relationships and i always thought people would think the worse of me  .. im not sure what else to say but, hello everybody! i hope everybody’s day is going nicely and stay positive as much as you can!"
Does anybody else experience periods of extreme hyper sensitiveness to emotions occasionally?,12,mjgwi9,4,"This is going to sound weird maybe, I honestly don't know if it's my bipolar II disorder or the borderline personality disorder, but sometimes maybe once every 2 weeks or more, I get extremely emotional and cry **very very** easily at things that wouldn't normally make me cry. 

For example I'm watching Godzilla versus King Kong. The most basic of sad parts in the movie are making me literally tear up and want to just bawl. 

Normally when I see things like this I would think ""oh that's sad"" But it wouldn't phase me emotionally, I wouldn't have nearly as an emotional response."
Does anyone else have a difficult time being an advocate for themselves?,16,mjfuq7,2,"Currently I work part-time and I'm doing college part-time. To many people this might seem ""easily manageable"" but for me it's getting really difficult. I've dropped out of college before and now at 28 I'm trying to finish my degree. I have classes 2 days a week and work 4 days a week. I really want to ask my boss to let me work 3 days a week instead. I'm scared to ask but my mental health needs a days off (along with my housework). 

It sucks when being an advocate for myself is hard! I end up dealing with things that make me uncomfortable or stressed. I'm so worried my boss is going to be mean to me or say no. I already get the feeling he doesn't like me. I'm a part-time employee so I'm trying to give myself some perspective on this reasonable request."
How do you learn to stop taking things so personally?,36,mj9c1g,7,"I really need to learn that someone not replying to me for a while does not mean they don’t like me they might just be busy

and i need to stop crying all the time about my relationship.

So any advice would be great but I’m really close to killing myself and some advice would be great"
"Does splitting/devaluing always come as conscious thoughts about disliking the person, or do you sometimes just get really anxious/paranoid about someone?",1,mjszuq,1,"I don't know if the title makes sense, let me try to explain. 

Part of why I wasn't sure if I have BPD before is because I wasn't sure I related to the whole devaluing thing... like I don't feel like I suddenly have thoughts that I dislike someone I was liking a lot before and push them away. But I do notice that sometimes in the past, with someone who I'm possibly idealizing or feeling too attached to, I'll kind of push them away out of fear in one form or another. It's not even just the ""I feel like they'll leave so I'm going to push them away"" (at least not consciously) that I hear about with BPD. Instead it's getting anxious or even paranoid about them, suddenly feeling like they don't have good intentions and are almost dangerous, interpreting talks more negatively (I'll swear they're judging me or think they're being hurtful). Maybe these are just times when I actually became aware of someone being bad vibes, I don't know, but it feels like it might be more than that.

I do also somewhat split or devalue, but I never felt like it was ""extreme"" enough to be BPD. And it wasn't in the context of romantic relationships (since I've avoided those most of my life). It'd be getting annoyed at family members and suddenly feeling distant and less loving toward my family (still loving them, just not feeling it at the moment), wishing I could start a new life and be away from them (but then again there was conflict in the house, so who knows). Or I'd secretly think bitter negative thoughts about friends, like suddenly looking at this friend and seeing her as so fake. I thought of it as just kind of a bitchy bitter cynicism coming from my unhappiness, which I wished I didn't have but couldn't help."
Anyone else afraid to be in a new relationship?,9,mjhqn3,2,"I’m so afraid that I will do something stupid and hurt that person/ruin our relationship.

I don’t want to be needy, controlling or overreact.

I want to be in one, but I’m worried that I will destroy it because of my BPD tendencies."
I feel so unhappy,10,mjgzp5,4,"This disorder is so damn painful. Every day I feel like I'm somehow trying to get through life, but don't know what I'm doing because I wasn't granted a manual to life that all the functional people seem to own. It kind of feels like I fell out of my mother's womb straight into quicksand of some sort. Some days I'm able to stay more afloat than on others, but when I look back, I somehow haven't made any progress at all when it comes to getting out of it. I'm still stuck in the same exact spot and I don't really see a way out."
Why do I completely disappear and just watch it happen...,3,mjni5d,3,"I’ve been taking a few medications to cope with my extreme mood swings, and while they can blunt some of the symptoms, when I’m ACTIVELY “in an episode”, it’s like I’m not here. I call it an episode because it’s-- I’m not there. I’m not me. It’s like I forget who my boyfriend is and what he’s like, I forget physically where I am, and I have these violent sudden urges to run and self harm. I can say positive things I’ve learned in therapy but it’s like fighting the sea. I don’t even get the chance to think before I do something it’s like it’s just happening. I don’t sit and contemplate even, I’m just beating the shit out of myself by any means I can get my hands on. Whatever’s closest. I’ve tried DBT, it couldn’t even be utilized until I got on meds, and they worked in the beginning but they’ve been of little help lately. I just see what I’ve done later. It hurts my partner greatly. I do it to punish myself, “for being bad” (angry, or other feeling I’m not supposed to feel) which will cause me to be “abandoned and hated”. There’s an internal voice that speaks only in the second person, and I’m just subject to it’s abuse, physical and otherwise. It talks like “I’m going to kill you.” And “I’m gonna (hurt you)”. There’s a refractory period where I can think clearly/calmly for a few seconds then I hurt myself again, then for like maybe 20 seconds, then again. An hour later- again. 
I know, I have a diagnosis of PTSD too. I’m sure many of us do. I’ve only seen online articles talk about “contemplation” - not sudden violent “involuntary” compulsions to do it. God it’s hard, I feel so abusive.

I don’t have enough time to think. I’m just sitting in a destructive body. What does it take to get me out of that rush? Has anyone dealt with that?"
How do you now bring up stuff that’s been a problem the whole time?,6,mjik7x,3,"This sounds weird but I think it’s a quiet bpd trait so maybe not to yous? I realise it’s the exact same patterns I have with my emotions except this is physical which is why I think it’s weird.

I’m constantly in a mild amount of pain. More of an ache maybe. It’s not like immediately inhibiting but it affects my actions. Like I always lay instead of sit, for example, to the point where I now can’t comfortably sit down. 
I’ve never really told anyone this cos it didn’t seem relevant. I manage it, there’s nothing anyone else can do or that I need them to. It’s partly because I broke my back a few years ago and I think the rest of my body is due to being so sedentary afterwards so I’m pretty ashamed. 
I don’t think about it. I literally only noticed it was such a thing when I drank ayahuasca and realised I was blocking it out a lot and letting my subconscious mind deal with it.

I live with two people with painful chronic conditions so it would be ridiculous to complain when it’s so mild. 

But now it’s dawning on me that all this pushing shit into my subconscious is hiding from me the real extent of how it’s affecting me. I will constantly put off doing anything physical regardless of how much I enjoy it. I won’t even know why. I’m usually stoned so I’ve been chalking it down to that but I’ve been sober a little while now and I’m realising that there’s a process in which I picture doing literally anything and amongst any other feelings there’s an underlying exhaustion and I never realised why or even really that it was there. The feeling of exhaustion is disproportionate the actual pain I feel, almost like I’m picturing it as being excruciating, perhaps rationality lost by this process being mostly subconscious?

It’s affecting the people I care about. I cancel all my plans even though I was really excited about them and suppress the disappointment so I just have this constant apathy going on and don’t really understand why. 
I’m not doing enough round the house, the dog needs more attention and my sex life is non existent. And I’m just sat here ignoring it all, hating myself, feeling so distant from anyone and anything and having no idea why. 

Everything just feels like such a mess. I feel like I’ve wasted most of my life and it sort of feels like I’m lying to the people around me, like I’m hiding some deep, dark secret even I’m not fully aware of. 
And I feel like I can’t just say this now. My boyfriend fell out with me today about things that are directly related to this and I didn’t say much cos I didn’t know what to. My mind was completely blank because I had no idea why. It’s only after that I’ve been thinking and noticed just how much pain I’m in. Particularly when sitting up which is how I need to be to do a lot of things I’m putting off. If I go back now and say “oh yeah Soz about the last two years, turns out I’m actually in pain and just never thought to mention it”. That sounds so fucking stupid. Especially when he’s currently in agony due to his own conditions. The ironic part is he’s constantly apologising for complaining about being in pain and I’m constantly reassuring him that he really doesn’t need to apologise nor suppress his expressions."
"Yearly, I hate my birthday post",10,mjg9t0,3,"I feel like my birthday always reminds me of how little people around me actually care. 

So I'm turning 25 this year, and I wanted to celebrate with dinner or something - so I started to ask people if they would be able to come, and most said no they wouldn't. It was either that or that they didn't know yet. Then there was the whole, I couldn't think past 5 people to even invite, because otherwise, it would be weird that I was inviting them. 

So yeah, every time April 1st rolls around, this whole month is wrapped in the gloom of my birthday being around the corner."
I cut him off *Small win*,17,mjcrrq,5,"I've posted about my ex previously but deleted the posts due to being embarrassed, but in short, we were together for 9 years in total and I broke down and contacted him yesterday. I'm embarrassed that I did as I was doing so well after two months of no contact. So down we went into our toxic pattern of saying how much we missed each other and he told me how sorry he was for the abuse over the years and I felt myself slipping. Dreaming of our wedding again, planning what our children would look like, growing old with him and then suddenly I stopped myself I said enough is enough. I explained to him the morning that I wished him well, was grateful for his apology and told him that I wouldn't be contacting him again and proceeded to block him off of everything, and removed all ways in which I could contact him. Usually, I would have let this carry on for weeks or even months until he hurt me again physically or sexually, but I decided enough was enough. I deserved more than what we were giving each other and I wanted to be free of the relationship. 

It's only something small but honestly knowing I had the power in me to do that is making me feel as though I'm getting somewhere, slowly but surely! I just want everyone to know that if I can make progress I'm so sure that all of you can and I'm so grateful for all of the support I've received from this forum"
"In a crisis over my ex, help, cw suicide",2,mjp6bb,0,"I am splitting over my ex, I am suicidal, I am alone, crisis services are useless, I feel so ashamed. 
Found out ex was sleeping with his ex while together and after, he's a narcissist, he's got a new girlfriend and all I can do is cry and feel sick about it. If this goes on I am going to hurt myself. I feel such a fool for loving him, and still somehow am hurt that he's moved on. Before I knew new information I found out I was still very much not over him, pining for him, and now I know he deserves none of it but it hurts so much I am throwing up.
Police and ambulance have nothing to offer, crisis team has nothing to offer, they've already visited me in the house. I've made a noose.

I need help getting my mind off this, the more I think about my ex the more desperate I get. I cant call anyone and wake them up even tho I'm suicidal. I really don't know what to do. I want to talk to someone until I fall asleep, and just be safe. "
BPD as a PD,8,mji3sk,13,"does anyone else hate the debate on whether BPD is a BPD or not? some people think it’s a mood or identity disorder. personally, i find that damaging. it is a BPD. it shares aspects with other PDs, for one. i just hate the debate on it."
DAE: Has anyone else had therapy problems?,9,mjgwhi,4,"I've changed so many therapists, I won't even mention the number because it's unbelievable. The things they say irritate me easily, I feel like they don't care enough to ask me the right questions or say the right things to me. Often I feel like I don't want to open up to them, or to express any feelings in therapy. Then they always point that out and that irritates me even more and it makes me even more unwilling to open up lol. Other times I take their words the wrong way, I accuse them of things and I start a fight. I've had fights with almost all of them, even the most patient and polite ones haha.  


I guess I am what you'd call a difficult patient. I was wondering if I am the only one."
First love and I hate it,0,mjrla7,3,"Sup I am 16yo and recently got hospitalized for severe depressions, as it turns out it is borderline anyways atm I am still hospitalized and just found my first love. 


She also 16 also has BPD, she is the most beautiful and impressive girl I have ever seen, we talked for hours and flirted for hours and it was going perfect. 


Then I told her about my feelings and she replied that she felt the same but after that we stopped talking. 

I now have my first girlfriend and we aren’t even talking I am spamming her whatsapp in my episodes in hope that I get any attention or approval from her. But nothing. Now she doesn’t know if she still loves me, I pressured her a bit into making a decision but nothing she wants more days. She litteraly told me she doesn’t love me today but doesn’t know how she feels in a few days.

I am so fucking scared I started cutting myself because of this shit, she is like a fucking goddess to me. But when we are getting too close everything crashes down and after 2 weeks we are already at a point where everything can just end. 

I need advice pls. I am fucking desperate my emotions are stronger then ever in the positive and negative"
Give me a moment,6,mjizg0,1,"Sometimes I feel so unstable.  I don't think anyone can deal with me. I feel alone. Empty. I can be strong. But  sometimes I want someone my side. I want to fall in love, but I'm such a mess."
Fighting,11,mje07l,8,"Hey.
 
Does anyone else have a hard time not being able to stop preventing a fight with someone? A friend? Partner? Or anyone? 
Like you don't know why you suddenly became so angry and it (you) always end up making a mess? Do I make sense? Do you understand? 

And if you do, how do you cope? How do you ""act opposite""? And is there any tips on how to actually try to prevent the fight from happening?

I'm not sure if this makes sense, but I'm so lost and the fighting is causing so many unnecessary fights and drama in my life, like I don't have enough of that already."
It hurts so much to feel so alone,7,mjgqxx,3,"I hate it. Everything seemed like it was getting better. Then suddenly it was worse than before. I wish I could find safety somewhere and in someone, like I did once before. I don't feel as if I have a home."
just realized a friend unfollowed me on instagram and i’m losing it,1,mjnkgq,3,So i’ve been having a rough time as of late concerning friendships. My roommate and I used to be part of a big friend group and ended up splitting up getting separate off campus apartments. The 3 friends in the other apartment would invite my roommate to hang out and not me. I usually had work or plans with my other friends so I just kind of ignored it. It became more frequent and I could just tell they didn’t want to tell me things or hang out with me. One of them just unfollowed me(although I think she actually blocked me then unblocked me) and I absolutely lost it. My roommate chooses them over me literally all the time and ignores me for weeks at a time. The other friend unblocking me made me feel physically hot I was so pissed of. So yeah one person who i’m not even close to led me to me crying for 3 hours and ripping the posters off my wall in my bedroom. FMLLLLLLL
Trigger Warning,5,mji670,3,"I get so tired of being worried about what other people think of me. It’s where most of my anxiety comes from, if not all of it. That fear of abandonment. Having no confidence in myself as a human being, or even as an adult. I feel like a child trapped inside a body, constantly reaching for any type of approval I can get. Constantly questioning myself and my interactions and if I’m good enough. Even if I am totally cool and capable in the moment, the second I step away my mind is clouded with doubt, insecurity, and second guessing. 
That’s the shit that makes me want to kill myself. More than absolutely anything else. If I have to deal with this unrest for the remainder of my life, why shouldn’t I end it? 

Anyways - this is how my brain spirals on a low. No matter how much time I have between lows, it’s like the last one never stopped. Does anyone relate to this specifically? I’m really shitty at putting this feeling into real words, so if it doesn’t make sense, I’m sorry."
"The past two years broke me, but I am rebuilding! [TW: ED/SD -mentioned vaguely]",16,mjaqqh,16,"So I've gone through hell the past few years. I was raped in 2019, while the love of my life was deployed. My heart was shattered as I was abandoned, and left alone as my world crumbled beneath my feet. My mom got very sick, and my Dad was diagnosed with a deadly form of cancer.

Self harming became extreme, my anorexia deeply formed and solidified, to the point I was a walking skeleton. April 2020, I was in a bad car accident that hurt me pretty badly, enough that I am still injured and feel pain, a year later. It took extreme levels of agony to be able to be able to stand unaided again, much less walk and move. It was hell, and extremely painful, and is a daily battle. My next relationship helped the anorexia, but deepend my self-hatred and unhappiness. Gaslit, and mentally tortured me. When I left, choosing homelessness over the 80 days of abuse he put me through...  He went insane. Held me hostage in a car. Stole everything I owned, including my dying cat. Which he stole and kept, until I was given her corpse back by the vet. Stalking, nothing shy of mental torture. Attempts at blackmail and extortion. Identity theft.... And god I can't even begin to list how many times he broke the restraining order by contacting me. Over 100 times! Destroyed various friendships of mine, and almost destroyed my relationship with my dying father. (Thank god my Dad is smarter than him.) He has been hellbent on ruining my life for no reason other than misplaced rage and spite, enough that I fled over 700 miles for my safety. I was borderline suicidal, and had given up on life. Enough that October 2020 I attempted to take my own life for the tenth time in my life. I saw no reason to exist.

Now I weigh a healthy amount, and have maintained it since November of 2020. I still don't eat daily, but... Mostly. I'm more happy I have kept on weight. I can work on proper eating habits later. 

I have not cut myself since October 2020. Have no had another suicide attempt since then, although truthfully I have had a few thoughts, in various bad moments.

I'm working on my car, and traveling issues and anxieties after the accident. Working on my social anxiety too, which has been extremely bad. (Yay covid vaccine and mindful social distancing to protect everyone else!) 

My body image issues are hell, but I am finally embracing myself, and my beauty. And learning how to begin to accept and love myself. It's hard as fuck... But so worth all of the work I've put into it. I love being able to feel pretty. It's a **lot** nicer than feeling disgusted with myself any time I tried to make myself look nice.

I have been able to build myself the start of a job I love more than I can describe, and being my own boss is highly helpful, because I can work around my mental health requirements. I am working towards getting insurance, so I can go and get a therapist, because I absolutely need one. But just because I have one doesn't mean I don't practice mindfulness or work on DBT and self-betterment. 

And working especially on my trust issues. Every day is a challenge, and work. And yes, I slip and fuck up sometimes... But I'm proud of the progress I have made. I've worked hard, and have come a very long way.

I still have so much work ahead of me. And I can't wait to apply myself. I forgot how wonderful, and beautiful actually *healing* is."
Is it common for BPD relationships to be rushed?,0,mjqmtp,2,"She had quiet BPD. We didnt break up once until discard. She idealized me for 2-3 years, then devalued for 2-3 years then discard took 2 weeks. She would internalize a bunch and not self harm but she was a people pleaser. She also had to have her way with many things and so when she wouldnt she would hold that against others. Like when she left me she brought up things that I thought we resolved but to her it was like she remembered each salt grain in the injury (not saying there was alot nor that I ever purposely hurt her). More so just mistakes that ended up hurting her because of her sensitivity. 

She has 0 friends because she finds it hard to trust.

The first 2-3 years were idealization it seemed. Had met her in college class, she was calling me babe and such 2 weeks into texting. First date we went to a movie, dinner, and an overlook. She had me grab her boobs over the shirt while we watched a movie in the movie theatre recliners. Then at the overlook she straddled me and we made out for like an hour. Hickies etc. She wanted to get naked and likely have sex or such but I stopped her just because I really dont want to do that so quickly with someone I was/am interested in dating more so then just a hook up. When I told her we can wait she seemed down and so I explained. Then driving home, she asked if we wanted to be official since we had been talking for about 3 weeks and that this was the first date. 

Rushed very much so. 

Our second date she introduced me to her 2 siblings that are close to her in age when we went on a triple couples date. 

I met her parents like within a month.

2 months in she tells me about her traumatic relationship past (2 boyfriends during first year of college, one 4 months and he was lying to her the entire time about himself, and second one sexually assaulted her when she and he were drunk).

Each time we see each other she is doing more and more sexual stuff. 

When we finally have sex, she didnt want to use a condom because she didnt like the ""barriers between us"". I was not okay with that, we used one.

Then we discussed her getting on birth control to not use condoms and we both agreed (this would bite me in the ass despite her agreeing - later she told me she was sacrificing for us being on birth control and that it hurts her that she needed to be on it. Almost like she felt I didnt want kids with her.)

She said I love you around at 3 months. 

8 months-1 year she was talking about having a family with me and getting engaged secretly so her parents didnt find out. She mentioned getting pregnant and moving away for 9 months so her family wouldn't know (their religious).This didn't happen because ... college and I set a clear boundary thats not what I wanted to do right then. But also after time went on this fizzled out despite me telling her I wanted this when we graduated so I could support and afford things.

We texted every single day good morning and goodnight despite whatever was happening. If I missed a text, she would get mad or sad like I didnt care. 

She almost always wanted to spend time with her family and not mine, her reasoning was because she felt comfortable around them and their loyal to her so she feels safe.

During the phase of devaluation, it began when she expected to get engaged on our 4 year anniversary. We drove home after a weekend vacation, she cried 3 of the 4 hours and was mad and sad with me because she created this expectation of it happening and when it didnt she felt I didnt love her or that I didnt want to take the next steps. I shared with her my plans to get engaged a few months following graduation - she still was sad. So after this, anything I did to remotely hurt her without intent and to even the smallest degree she held like an umpire calling 3 strikes. Things I figured we talked through and moved past she never moved past because she brought them up during the 2 week breakup discard phase. 

Her quiet BPD would come out in her pouting like a child and blaming others for the pain she felt. For example at the beginning of covid she wanted to take a trip with me and her sister. We both said to her that we felt uncomfortable because of covid and didn't want to go. She got really hurt and said ""I am simply trying to figure out plans for us to get out of the house and enjoy ourselves, but you two just shut my idea down so it doesnt even matter.""

Does this seem normal for those with BPD? 

Or is this just how a normal long term relationship progresses?"
How do I learn how to take decisions,3,mjj6ry,10,"I (19f) just can't take decisions, I think too much. Idk how people can just choose and move on. I left my toxic relationship some week ago only to go back in it again. I feel stuck, please help me."
I just got diagnosed with BPD and it’s already getting used against me.,11,mjd9iw,7,"My therapist diagnosed me with BPD a couple days ago. I told my family and significant other. I thought they would be supportive, and also just wanted to share that. I had been questioning if I had it for a while. 

My family now tells me i’m “splitting” whenever someone genuinely upsets me, and my significant other would say the same thing. He also told me when I was upset that it’s my “BPD acting up”

Is this a common thing? I didn’t think they were going to define me by this. It feels extremely bad."
i cant do this anymore,10,mjdwfo,2,i hate being like this so fuckint much. i keep splitting and i’m tired of it. it’s so draining i am sobbing so hard over this person when a second ago i wanted them gone. why am i like this fuckint christ i want it to be over so bad i hate this so bad someone please just ugh i want to just stop i want it all to stop
I'm in a relationship with someone who has BPD and I want to be as supportive and helpful as possible. What are resources I can use and what are things I should know?,5,mjiw01,2,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 months, and there are times where she is obsessed with me and I love it, but there are also days/times where she is very distanced with me, finds things to complain about in everything, and generally wants to keep a lot of distance between us.

We communicate about it, about how she can see it happening, understand it, but it still happens. About how she's ashamed about it a bit and hates herself for it.

I want to be as supportive as I can, she's such a perfect match with me and I really want to be there for her in every way that I can. I'm currently doing my best to make her not feel trapped with me. I'll ask if she wants a hug or if she wants space, and I'll never question the answer regardless of what it is. I do my best to be with her and make sure she knows I'm not abandoning her when I'm not around, I know that's one thing that bothers her, and I will always be just a text or a phone call away.


What are things I can do better for her? What resources can I use to help and help her feel safe and reduce triggers?"
“You could be so much worse”,2,mjmo6f,5,"Does anyone else get triggered by this? My partner and I were discussing YouTube videos he had seen featuring people with BPD, and I asked if they reminded him of me in any way just to spark conversation about myself and my negative borderline habits. He replied that no, not particularly, and that they behaved in a way that was worse and more extreme than me. I asked how, and he explained that they cut themselves more often and said nastier things than I do. I immediately split on him. I interpreted it as him implying that my pain is not as bad as their pain. I know it is absolutely ridiculous and that was not his intention, but I feel so unsure of myself and my identity as a “sick” person. Why am I like this."
Think of yourself as “in recovery”,9,mjdfyp,0,"Last year I did a stint in-patient and have since gotten on meds, gotten a therapist and stopped self-medicating with weed. I’ve cut my outbursts down to almost none at all (yay!), but I’ve struggled with major anxiety and depression since. My therapist tells me to think of myself as “in recovery,” which is something I try to remember when I’m feeling overwhelmed. In recovery means everything doesn’t have to be perfect. In recovery means I’m still on the road to feeling better. In recovery means I have a disorder that I’m still learning to control."
Keep using DBT skills,5,mjfucb,0,I recently finished my 6 month DBT program. I definitely didnt think it helped that much until I reflected on it and realized how much calmer and patient I am. Still not 'perfect' but much easier to be around. Anyway how do I keep using my skills and not relapse into who I was before? I want to keep getting better at handling myself and using the skills I learnt but I find it so hard without 'school'.
Dissociating and trying to take the other person's perspective during social situations...?,1,mjptpp,0,"I've realized this is something I do, I think I've done it most of my life, and it's kinda horrifying. 

A lot of the time, if I've been alone and relaxed and then I go to talk to someone, it's like I tense up and I can feel my attention changing in a way where I start almost observing myself somewhat in 3rd person. My focus shifts, and rather than being able to just be me and focus on my thoughts, half of my brain is just thinking about what I think they're thinking and how they'd want me to be, and often end up acting according to it.

 It happens so naturally to me around people. It's like the 1st person view, my sense of myself as an independent existing person and everything is just swept out from under me like a rug. Most of my own thoughts leave my mind, and I'm trying to act like this little puppet and please the other person. If I try to fight it, try to be myself and just not think about this at all... well, at times it's just impossible to do, and it feels so intensely anxiety-inducing that I have to dissociate and people-please again to keep from going crazy with anxiety. 

I don't know whether this is a people-pleasing, fawning type think, or whether it's masking (from ASD), or what.

Does anyone else do this?"
"When you're BPD and you're idolizing someone, and you know someone who has BPD (ex) and is idolizing you.",1,mjpt1e,1,"This is so painful. I can't feel anything for her, and I know that she's absolutely obsessed with me, feels like I'm everything. They feel like I'm the best thing on earth, and want to be with me so much, even if it means that I'll hurt them. I know I'm going to hurt them so I can't be with them. I know that it'll only be toxic if I'm with her again.

Meanwhile I'm obsessing over someone (My FP), and being in the position of being rejected is difficult to cope with although I've mostly gotten over it and can now have a healthy relationship with them, without the obsession being present. But with her, she's not making much improvement. She still wants to be with me so, so, very bad. And I just cannot do it. It gives me perspective to how the obsessed feels about the obsessor, and I know just how much pain she is feeling for me, because I felt so much pain when I couldn't be with him. I felt like life was pointless without him at the worst of it, and she's straight up told me that's how she feels since she can't be with me. And I just can't change the way I feel.

If there's anything positive about this:

\-It makes it really clear how it feels to be an FP, I guess, because I am hers.

\-It makes it really clear how it feels to be obsessed over when that isn't what you want.

\-It makes it clear to me how I need to keep my obsessions together, or else I'll lose a nice, positive person in my life."
Is anyone else unable to know if they're dreaming or not ?,7,mjfblm,5,"I know it sounds kind of confusing but, for a few weeks now I can't tell a dream from reality. Like, last night I was dreaming I was texting someone, but then I woke up and saw I didn't text, only I didn't wake up and was still dreaming. So I decided to text them, and surprise surprise I woke up again and hadn't text, but I think I was still dreaming. It is like a cycle. I still woke up in the morning thinking I had send that text but I didn't. This as been happening me with all sorts of things and I feel like I'm going mad, I wake up tired and super confused.  I can't even trust my self at night smh, has anyone else experienced this ?"
"My bf won't answer me and I think he's sick of me and wants to leave me. And if he doesn't, I think me freaking out will make him.",2,mjl9rw,3,"I am freaking tf out. My bf and I have been together for almost 2 years. With my bpd and his add, we have our hiccups, but for the most part it's good. I love him very much.
About a week ago, after he left my place, he stopped answering my messages as often. He'd text a reply maybe 2-3 times a day, where normally we'd text on off through out the whole day. He just got a new PS game and he said he's been in his own little world playing his game and not paying attention to his phone, which in and of itself is fair enough... But it hurts, and I get scared. I told him this and asked that he'd try to remember to check his phone once in a while, like when he takes breaks to get food or things like that, and if he could at least text me goodnight when he goes to bed so I know he's not angry or ignoring me.
But he didn't.
He came over yesterday and we had another talk about it, where he promised to be more considerate, and I believed him...
Except I haven't heard a word from him since he left 15 hours ago. Ive sent some texts and tried to keep my cool, but I'm just about to lose it. I tried calling him but it goes straight to voice mail.
I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm dying. I have a feeling that his phone battery is dead and he's gone to bed (it's half past 2 in the morning), but that means he hasn't set an alarm and probably won't wake up til very late, and I probably won't get a reply before tomorrow afternoon.
I am so fucking scared of laying here alone with all these feelings. I'm so sad, and scared, and pissed, and hurt. I feel like he's going to leave me, which I told him, and he said that's not going to happen... But idk. I've considered telling him that we NEED to work this out, and that it needs to stop bc it's destroying me, and if we don't I fear it's gonna be the end of us, because I can't stand being in this state of emotion for much longer... But I'm also scared that if I say that then he's going to crack and tell me that he actually wants to break up with me, and that that's why he's been withdrawing"
"I want more attention from my boyfriend; even though he spends most of his time on me, I still weirdly feel ignored?",2,mjozp8,2,"26F here. I feel too petty to ask for it... I feel like being toxic AF and ignoring him because I feel kind of hurt. Like he went to his family for Easter then invited me last minute cuz I guess he realized it’s rude, then he went out with friends to a bar and didn’t even call to say goodnight to me. Idk I just feel like less loved by him and i feel like rejecting him since I feel rejected, that way I can save my ego and pretend it’s not him leaving me but my own choice. I was abandoned a lot as a child, so I know that’s why I act this way, but it doesn’t change the fact that I still want to do it :/ I just wish he realized that yes I’m dramatic and annoying but calling me to say goodnight means a lot to me and he knows I had a bad day so I just wish he connected the dots himself . He does spend most of his time on me I think I just need to be a brat and vent here on a forum where ppl can understand me without thinking I’m an ass. I’m letting him enjoy his time but ugh just feeling ignored and less important rn"
I'm feeling extremely alone and unable to speak to the people closest to me about my feelings,6,mjfk4y,0,"As per the title, I feel really alone. I almost feel like I'm in a box where no one can hear me and I can see people but they can't see me. Or like I'm watching myself type this message up. I've gone through DBT and built myself up to be able to function enough to get a job and talk to new people and make phone calls and all of that stuff. But communicating with the people closest to me during these episodes is the hardest thing ever because the guilt of putting my problems on anyone else is TOO overwhelming. (Especially recently, given my partner has recently attempted suicide and ended up on a ventilator - she's alive and physically well now but mentally she's still in the drains. My poor girl.) 

I feel like I have no outlet anymore. I'm very much a loner - but being a loner is something I'm happy with, I prefer to be by myself and not have many friends, unless they're able to understand that I'm not always able to be the super outgoing, fun and adventurous person that I can be. A gal gers tired you know? I just need to be able to let off some steam from time to time because once that bottle starts filling up, it's only going to explode and cause misery for anyone around. 

Any advice on how I can alleviate these thoughts and feelings without feeling guilty would be greatly appreciated!"
What the heck am I doing?,3,mjhu1a,2,"So I dont know if this fits here, but i recently started cutting dumb things in my body,

""I USE ARCH BTW""

"I wish I had more friends but at the same time I don't want to get to know ""new"" people and I feel like I won't have enough time/energy to keep more relationships (friendships). Feeling bad about it cause I'm afraid I'm sabotaging myself..",6,mjdeup,0,"Alrighty so I have 1 male bestfriend and 1 female bestfriend. He honestly is my FP and I got to admit I spend most of the time with him and he's always on my mind. He lives nearby and I care about him a LOOOOT. My female bestfriend lives in an other town and we don't see each other that often anymore since she moved there and she's very busy with school. 

I had to put my school at pause for 1,5 year now and next September I'm going to resume my nursing graduation year. I don't have any groups of friends and since I'm not going to school anymore, and I work in teams with older nurses, I'm not in a great situation to spontaneously make new friends. 

My FP has lots of friends, different groups of friends and lots of social contacts. My female bestfriend is such a sweetheart, I absolutely adore her and I'm ashamed to say I recently started to feel a bit jealous of her.. We're very much alike and we understand each other so well it's like she's my long lost twin. She's going to artschool and she gained new friendships and is very busy getting to know the people from school and gets in contact with new people trough what they have in common: making art. I'm so so proud of her and so happy for her but at the same I'm ashamed to admit I'm a little bit jealous. 

I don't mind that she has less time for me and I don't even feel like I'm being replaced. I'm jealous cause we both used to only have each other, and now that she's gaining more friendships and getting to know more like-minded people, and I see all the fun she's having on Instagram, I feel like I'm failing.. I know I shouldn't compare myself to anyone but i just feel lost on where to find LIKE MINDED friends, non judgemental people, since it's covid + I'm not going to school (+the class I started with all graduated already) +at work there's no one of my age. 

I always felt like I was destined to be a loner, just have 1 or 2 friends.. I never really cared about it and to be honest I'd rather be with my FP all the time than having multiple friends I have to divide my time between. But I feel like I'm missing out or like I'm sabotaging myself into feeling like I'm not worthy of having friendships/being social. I'm afraid I'm keeping myself into the comfortzone and it might be better for me to shift my focus, find more friends so I can become a little less dependent on my FP.

Not sure if this is just a rant but any reply would be welcome. I could use some advice, recognition, anything. Tell me how you deal with this or if you even deal with this at all. Either way, thank you very much for reading and I'm sorry if this story gave you a headache cause English ain't my native language lol."
how do i find out someone if someone is mad at me without directly asking?,0,mjnl06,2,"usually no one is ever really mad at me. but whenever i think someone is currently upset with me i cannot do anything but obsess over it and get depressed. like i know they’re not mad but i’m feeling all of the sadness from it anyways.


before, i’d just directly ask “are you mad” in the hopes they’d simply say “no” and i’d feel fine again but of course the average person is gonna have a reaction to that question because it’s pretty weird to ask out of nowhere. it’s also annoying to always be asked that.


so is there a way i can find out without them knowing i feel they are upset? does this situation make sense to anyone else?"
"When therapists have been understanding, patient, etc., what did it mean for you?",3,mjh19x,2,"What difference did it make to your treatment and how you felt about treatment?

e.g. I would say myself, when I had a good therapist who I felt had patience and didn't judge me or push me too much, I felt safer to explore and disclose information I had previously been too scared to mention.

I'm a therapy student who has a history of significant mental illness nad a BPD diagnosis- trying to become the right sort of professional. I've experienced a lot of bad treatment myself from ill-informed staff who have been inaprropriate and rude. Some professional make too many assumptions about things they don't understand."
Not officially diagnosed so does it count..?,1,mjncmn,9,"I knew I had depression in my teenage year, but never thought of bpd back then. I'm 20y.o, and it's only last year that, when I was reading about mental illnesses, I can across stuff I 100% related to, and the name was bpd. I took an online test, result was that I certainly had it, and that I should get officially diagnosed. But I don't have the money nor the time to do it.
Then I talked about it to one of my closest friend and they said that it was pretty obvious for them. But I still don't want to self diagnose myself, it just looks like I'm seeking attention, because for so long, I thought that what I was feeling was normal.
When I told another friend about it they also told me that it was obvious, and even now they pick up stuff i do to prove it to me. 
But the thing is, I don't want to ""reclaim"" it till i officially get diagnosed, but also, some symptoms are there and it's undeniable. So if hypothetically I'm interested in someone, what should I tell them? Or should I even tell them anything at all?"
DAE want different things from their FP depending on the day,0,mjn5m4,0,"I feel like the things I want from my FP and the reasons why I want them completely change day to day. Last week I wanted her to be my mother and take care of me like a child, the week before that I wanted to be in a relationship with her or simply wanted her to cheat on her husband for a night with me, this week I just envy her and want the life she lives because I think it’s a worthy life.  I want what she has while also wanting to be a part of what she has. 

How do I deal with my feelings for her when I can’t even decide week to week what I’m actually feeling for her? I’d like for things to just be normal with her but I don’t know how to get to that point."
This weeks been hell. New job and just found out my bf cheated on me,1,mjn4e4,1,"We’ve been together for nearly 3 years. We’ve been having issues. I’ve been off the rails because he works out of town and I never get to see or speak to him much, when we do he’s distant. He can back from work after nearly 3 weeks and didn’t even smile when he saw me. I started my new job the next day, it’s an opportunity I can’t pass up for my future so it’s really important my mental health is decent. He didn’t want me around and I had a full on breakdown. I hadn’t slept or eaten so that intensified my mood. I punched myself and hyperventilated until I went to sleep. The next day we decided to not see each other for a few days and have some space. I found out he went to my brothers house with cocaine and was up all night. I told him to never bring coke to my brothers house and he did. I was furious. I was starting work and he was high and so uncaring to me. We didn’t see eachother for 2 days and decided yesterday to see eachother again. We were having a great day, I wanted to work past all the issues we’ve been having. We had sex and just laughed all day. Until I brought up the fact that one of his friends has been trying to contact me since the morning he did blow. His friend wanted me to call him. I knew something was up because I never hear from this person. I confronted bf and he told me that he was high and drunk and called a bunch of friends to tell them how crazy I am. He said he talked to a female friend and one thing lead to another and he got nudes from her. He told me that she said “don’t you have a gf” his response is “she’s crazy man” and then it progressed. I’m so fucked up and I don’t know what to do. I can’t be alone, I can’t believe he did this to me, again after regaining my trust. I feel ugly and worthless and I’m so fucking hurt. I can’t go through a breakup again it will kill me"
DAE fantasize about bad things happening to their FP,0,mjn2mk,9,"CW: mentions SA

I find myself fantasizing about my FP being in a situation that would cause a lot of emotional pain (most of the time some sort of SA) because I want her to confide in me. I feel so much guilt about this because obviously I don't want her to be in pain, I just feel like it would prove to me that she likes me. I feel like if she told me something that serious I would struggle to believe our relationship is one sided."
"I'm not currently diagnosed with BPD since I'm younger than 18, but I have some concerns, did anyone else have them?",0,mjqjso,1,"Long story short though, I'm currently diagnosed with GAD for about 3 years now and it was hell getting to understand what I'm experiencing and getting a diagnosis, given the fact that I live in a third world country.

It was an awful experience getting overprescribed by benzodiazepines in the early days of my diagnosis. All in all you get the picture, shitty mental health care, shitty therapy.

I've always got concerns on whether or not I have BPD and through research I feel like i strongly relate to Quiet BPD. Now alright I don't wanna seem like a ""Self diagnosed / Furry / Half demon / Xe/Xem"", But I'm honestly pretty concerned and just understanding or putting a label that'll make me understand these random awful experiences would make it much easier to deal with.

Is there any other way I could get a proper diagnosis or do I have to just keep playing russian roulette with therapists and psychiatrists until i find a proper one that'll help? And did anyone else experience this in their youth too?"
"I ruined everything I had, but I'm not really sad about it",4,mjeoe9,0,"Me (27F) and my husband (29M) are together for 5,5 years. There were ups and downs, but I didn't really felt to run away from him. And if, it was those crazy daydreaming stories, that I do not want to be true. 

Past few month thanks to covid situation, it was really hard on my husband. He can't do his job (luckily he is fully paid), he can't do his hobby. Last two months was super hard, because he had tendonitis in his hands, so he cannot do nothing. He's gamer, and he could play. Torture for him. 

For me it was extremely hard, because I just didn't expose my emotions at all. I was diagnosed quiet BPD. Every emotion is bubbling inside me, instead of exposing it. So it hurts phisycally every single day. When I expose it, it's just...everything. When I'm sad, I'm crying so hard, that I cannot breathe, when I'm happy I laugh to tears, when I'm angry, I'm agressive...I think you know what I mean. So it's like constant anxiety, because when I do not expose it, it's just like fire inside, that hurts as hell. 

I managed it and I feel really good about myself. Few years ago it was so bad, that my emotional bursts were like every single day. And because I had so many emotions locked inside, I was always confused, what I'm feeling. It was hours, sometimes day, that I couldn't remember correctly, because it was just soo foggy. Now I can remember it and I can be moderately calm about it. I'm not agressive, or selfharming.

For past half year, I was just empty and didn't felt anything. I started to smoke weed more and more, to not feel anything at all. I wanted to be fully present for my husband in his dark times. He was sad all the time. And his responses are not crying, but being just ugly to me. Everything pissed him off, even if I was nice to him every single time and tried to communicate everything to support his needs...instead of mine. 

Our sex life is nonexistent. He is just not horny and I am horny all the time. I learned to just masturbate, watching porn. Sometimes there's sex, but I feel like hand, that he's using for masturbating, instead of his wife, that he loves. No foreplay, almost no touching, looking to his eyes...it's just sad. 

It was Thursday this week (today is 3th of April) and our common friend M asked my husband out. His girlfriend B introduced us and and since day we met, we felt that ""animal connection"". M is working in porn industry and he is just as horny and twisted as me. B is frigid and scared of sex.

My husband and M went to continue with hanging out in our house. We were drinking and after my husband went to bed, we was alone. We were talking at first, but something happened. We were discussing one kiss, that we had. My husband knows about it. But me and M interpreted this kiss differently. But from there, it was just blank horny mind, that was driven only by instincts. 

We were kissing each other, and just petting each other. Clothes were on and we were aware, that we cannot have sex. It was really nice. I felt like woman after really long time. He was so horny and me too. Everything was right and I just wanted to continue with it. After some time we split and went sleep each to different bed. 

After we wake up, we were with me and my husband talking just about random shit. B should come and I wanted to discuss it with my husband in privacy. But after party went through the night and B and V went to sleep to diferent room. But me and M were...just like we continued the night before, but much more intense. Clothes were on and I was aware of my rule. But I couldn't help myself and just touched him through his pants, he touched my breast and so on. It was really beautiful. 

We all discussed the possibility of sharing each others parnters lot of times. But each time we were against it. I am borderline and B is borderline too (I think, she diagnosed herself as ADHD, but I just see true BPD, maybe some comordibity, but I'm not an expert). So we didn't want to tempt anything.

Last two days were different. I just cannot think. It was such a long time, that I felt this animal hornyness, that I love. And my husband is scared of me that way, because sometimes I'm danger to him or myself. So I went vanilla past 5 years. 

I told my husband and he is reacting as he should. He's feeling betrayed. He would felt that way, if I tould him after the night that happened first. I shouldn't continue it the next night. Now he's thinking upstairs and I am in bedroom. I took lexaurin and smoke some weed to calm myself down. And it helped a lot. Still I'm feeling as a shit, but I should feel that way. 

I told him one thing, that I realised. I just need hardcore sex full of passion in my life. What I have with my husband sexually isn't enough, but almost everything else is great. We communicate with each other greatly, but still...sometimes I feel like I love my friend. Not my husband. 

It's just messed up. I'm messed up. I want to have this marriadge, but I just need to have option to have sex with someone, that actually enjoys sex. Not that it's only obligation. I just want passion in my life. Nothing more. And M is ideal for it. We have perfect love/hate relationship, we clicked in every single of our fetishes, and there's absolute no possibility, that I could possibly love him. I cannot respect him enough for it. He's just my annoying friend, with whom is possible to talk about porn in absolute open way. 

I need to wait. And if we will get divorce, I wouldn't be mad. Sad yes, angry that I spend 5,5 years with someone, that actually wants to be alone, but not mad. Maybe it will be good for me. But my plans for having a family would have to wait for some time...and maybe I'm just calm about it, because I have lexaurin and ton of THC inside of me. 

P.S.: I know, that I shouldn't smoke and drink as much. I know that taking lexaurin without prescription is not really good for me. I cannot be 100% abstinent in anything, I have agreement with my therapist about these things. This is too much, I know, but truly I'm glad that I didn't took anything worse, that we have ""archived"" for 4 years in our house."

Now I don't know if that has come up because maybe instagram is tracking what I search(I watch alot of true crime documentaries and people have instagram accounts about the crimes and they have interesting posts on there so i search up the names of the crimes or criminals) or is has it come up just because instagram believes bpd is a dangerous subject to talk about.

My BPD is based of identity shifting, rage, and dissociation, that is more in relation to DID, except it's identities and not full blown personalities.

I've come to notice that BPD, DID and ASPD in terms of the identity aspect have a lot in common, they just manifest in different ways.

What other people's most prominent symptoms and how do they affect you?"
my parents think my bpd stems from myself,16,mj2hu8,6,"TW: suicidal thoughts 

I’m literally at my last straw and I feel like I’m completely losing it. I recently opened up to my mom how I truly feel, I basically told her how I constantly think about killing myself and how I can no longer live like this and I really need help. She basically told me I brought this upon myself, and that no one can help me except myself. Except I don’t even know what’s going on with me, and I’m freaking out. I’m really at my last straw. She told me I’m selfish for unloading all of this on her because it makes her sad. I wish I had a mother who would just hug me and say it’s ok. 

The worst part is that she thinks that it’s me who gave myself this “illness” when in reality it was years of my mom and dad being both physically and mentally abusive towards me. I don’t know what to do. I really need help, but my parents don’t understand. I’m so sick of feeling this way. I just want to feel ok again, except I don’t know what ok feels like. Thanks for taking the time out of your day for reading this :)"
I am just so tired,0,mjgvk5,1,"Sorry for the long post, but at this point I need to let out my thoughts

I am just so tired of constantly being betrayed, being lied to, being used and then discarded later. I don't know what's the point in trying so hard to become a better person, and be loving when it has to end up in disappointment, betrayals, backstab and lies? 

Full disclosure: I have my issues, I never was a good boyfriend. But I tried my best despite everything, I actually loved my last partner with everything I had, I never lied about how I felt about her. Even after everything ended badly (two people with BPD getting in a relationship was never a good idea in the first place), I still cared for her as a friend, it's just something of what I am as a person, I can't forget about the people I once loved. I kept tabs on her mental health as much as possible from her Reddit posts, I never talked about them with her because I knew she didn't want to talk about that stuff with me, I just did that so that I could offer some support if it came to it. A couple days back she posted on an advice subreddit about a medical issue that troubled her, and in it she mentioned that she never had any feelings for me at any stage, never found me attractive, and was just with me because she had no other option. This just completely shattered me, it fucking destroyed me and took me back to the hole I was trying so hard to run away from.

I had accepted everything that was wrong with me, I agreed on almost everything she said was wrong about me, and am actually working on those things to be a better person. But that revelation, it just worsened my self esteem issues. And when I confronted her about it, expressed how hurt I was and how it would have been better for me to hear this from her own mouth rather this way, I was rightly told how it was my fault for going through her Reddit (stupid ik, but I had requested her while parting ways that I would appreciate if she didn't post about me there because I can't going through her Reddit), what really hurt me was how she just said that it was a white lie, and if she would never say it to someone with bad self esteem issues.

I just don't understand why? It just hurts now to see how all the times I was told I didn't love enough, I was just trying to love someone who didn't even like me. I hate how this revelation has just numbed me so much that I can't be upset about it, lash out or atleast be able to fucking cry my heart out for once. I am just shattered to my core, I try so hard to be close to my emotional side, and everytime something like this happens and I am back to putting up walls all around me.

I wish I could atleast hate her for this, all there is disappointment and just forgetting every memory about her I have been cherishing during my bad times in a whiff. I hate pity more than anything and that was all that I was actually getting during the whole disaster of a relationship? It just keeps breaking me from the inside as all these traumas get buried deep inside me, breaking me apart piece by piece slowly.

I try so hard to keep on living, be better, overcome my issues and be the best person I can be, and keep on loving life. But it just seems like an impossible task, I don't know if I will ever be able to trust or love someone again. I am just so fucking scared that maybe the next time I get suicidal, I may not be able to hold myself back. It sucks to suffer like this, I just hope it stops soon, I really don't know how long can I keep fighting like this."
I HATE THIS,11,mj3w0a,1,"So basically my current FP told me he didnt wanted to hang out yesterday bc of a misunderstanding and I was ok with it THEN i went on to get slightly drunk (bpd + alcohol: hell) and LIKE THE STUPID BPD HEAD I AM I BLOCKED HIM EVERYWHERE AND DECIDED TO CUT ALL CONTACT just to regret it this morning when I woke up.. and NOOOOOOOW HE WONT TALK TO ME BC HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT I CAN BE A LITTLE bratty and unstable..

SO YEAH, HERE I GO AGAIN BEING THE COOL GIRL THAT SUDDENLY TURNED INTO THE UNSTABLE MONSTER.

well.. RIP us, I kinda saw a future BUT who would want a future with someone like this? I hate my life and my stupid radical brain."
Is it normal with BPD to feel nothing for your partner at times?,18,mj1jyu,11,"This is something I've experienced in the past, but since this is my first long term relationship, it's becoming more of a problem. 

I love my girlfriend to the moon and back, but I go through periods of time where I feel little to no attraction or romantic feelings at all. 

Sometimes when we kiss it's like fireworks, but lots times it feels like nothing at all. There are so many times where I have cognitive knowledge that I am having an amazing romantic moment with someone who I love but my emotions just aren't there. 

The one thing that never really fades is the comfort I feel when I'm around her and how soothing it is to be in her arms. She's not my FP, so I know those feelings are genuinely about her and nothing else.

I always know that I love her and am attracted to her, but most of my feelings come and go so much that it sometimes makes it hard to feel happy in this otherwise loving and committed relationship.

 Is this a BPD thing? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just crazy or not really in love? What do I do? I feel so guilty for how I feel. :("

I'm working and full time in college and I'm just overwhelmed. I quite literally am falling apart.

Anyone talk out loud to themselves everyday?,154,mio2o9,35,"I just want to know if anyone else here talks to themselves. Out loud like someone else is in the room. Have conversations and talk about what's on TV and whats going on with yourself. 
 

I know it seems weird lol but I just want to know



Wow Thank you I didn't expect alot of people to upvote this. I just talk out loud and say my thoughts. Sometimes I'll pause the TV just to think out loud. It's like I'm my own friend. I just didn't expect alot of people to do the same thing. Idk if it's normal or not lol. Some people think it's crazy lol"
BPD struggling with hobbies/alone time.,5,mj5j5u,4,"It's hard for me to remember what I used to do and how I spent my free time, before I got in a relationship with my boyfriend.   
We're very close and moved in together quite fast, but he knows about my bpd and is very understanding, also I'm working hard on my bpd, so our relationship is going very great!  
However, we spend a lot of time together and I'm okey with that, because he's my fp, but he needs his free time too.   
I understand that and want to cooperate with him in this, but I'm struggling to find new hobbies or how to spend time alone enjoyably. Things bore me out quickly and I don't know how to push myself to try new things. More so I don't even know what to try.  
Any recommendations on hobbies and how to enjoy my time alone?"
dude.. BPD is no joke,83,mirqvu,13,"in the matter of seconds/minutes i can ruin everything and not feel any negative feelings for those two seconds. but after the matter of me destroying my relationship singlehandedly in under a minute, i feel complete and utter guilt for even existing.

"I feel like I can’t connect with anyone, even those close to me.",3,mj7r6d,2,"(26F) I‘m struggling so much with feeling entirely disconnected from everyone in my life, and I don’t know what to do. I have weekly therapy. I recently had a 6 week inpatient stay. I’ve changed my meds. I’ve had TMS. I maybe (?) have autism; my psychiatrist puts my symptoms down to BPD, depression and dissociative episodes. 

This is a disconnected post, sorry. 

I’m in a 6-year (polyam) relationship with my BF who has a GF of 1 year. We previously all dated, but her feelings for me faded and now she’s primarily with him, even though the three of us spend most our time together in the same house. I feel like an alien, like I’m invisible. 

It feels like I’m angry at everyone all the time, like I can’t tolerate anyone - and at the same time I feel so disconnected. It’s like I’m putting up a wall that no one can see. Everyone reassures me they love me, my BF says he wants to be with me. His GF says she loves me too. People reach out to me frequently. I get praised for my work. I’m doing a PhD. 

I don’t reply to anyone because it feels like I can’t; I feel nothing about the relationships I have with people and then just continue to let them die. I want to feel some sort of desire to talk to people, to have some sort of ability to maintain a community. 

I’m so sick of feeling empty. Why can’t I connect to people? It feels like I could pick up and live my life alone in an instant and nothing could change. I feel so alone and alien. It’s almost like I don’t exist. I want to feel alive. 

It feels like the only things I have to make me feel alive are sex, disordered eating behaviours and SH. I don’t have the former beside my libido evaporated years ago thanks to meds. Thanks to therapy I no longer have those other coping mechanisms in my everyday life - the result being that I have nothing that helps me connect to the world. So what the hell do I do?"
Being in a poly relationship and dealing with abandonment,4,mj6dy6,2,"I often feel i can't do it anymore, but I'm fixated and obssesed. I spend my time in the most stupid and unhealthy ways. Just looking at his social media or of the women he pursuit. I'm tired that everything detonates my fear of abandonment. I live in fight or flight. I'm constantly telling him i  can't no longer do it because he doesn't make me feel safe. When we are together things are great, loving and fun but when I'm not around him everything collapses and i just want to hate him. I wish i could like someone else but I'm obssesed and i can't even look at anyone but him. I'm thinking about moving to another country so i can let him go."
Taking out triggers on FP (21F) DAE/how to manage,3,mj7gd8,4,"Ok so first up I wanna clarify that I’ve never done anything physically harmful to my partner, I don’t yell or throw things at him or anything explosive. 

I do however get into constant low sulky moods where I’ll tell him that he’s being mean in a kind of jokey way, or get frustrated and grumpy if he’s not giving me the type of attention I want/trying to do or watch something without me. 

It’s like something will happen to make me feel some sorta way and in my head he should know that that thing happened and that I’m upset without me even having to tell him. 

We both work late hours in tiring jobs and he does a lot of the cooking and caring for my dog. I know that my behaviour weighs on him a lot but in the moment I just never realise I’m doing it. 

Does anyone have any advice about managing/recognising this typa behaviour? Thanks guys I love you ❤️"
Is it wrong to ask my bf to not go to a certain gym?,1,mjdvbk,3,"My boyfriends ex works out at the gym I work out at and my boyfriend has been thinking about going to the same gym.

BPD and struggling with jobs.,8,mj3abm,5,"Recently I got a new job, which is great!   
I'm proud to have responsibilities and my own income, but with all my past jobs (including my current job) and bpd, I've noticed that I've always struggled with keeping a good image and doing the work I'm suppose to do.   
I keep trying to find ways how to lack at work and try to escape my responsibilities in a way no one could notice, but these actions can lead to getting fired or leaving a very bad impression of myself, if I get caught.  
I try to push myself to do these responsibilities, but if I'm ''not in the mood'' it's hard for me to push myself past this point.  
Am I the only one? Any recommendations on how to get better at jobs?"
I think I was misdiagnosed with bipolar 🙃,0,mjdqf6,8,"So I was diagnosed with bipolar Bipolar when I was 17. Iv recently gone back to therapy after A very toxic marriage was over. I am a very self aware person (almost to the point where it drives me insane) Iv read that with BPD mood swings are trigger by events whereas bipolar is more random... I would 100% say that I am triggered by events or interactions with people. A phone vibrating while I’m hanging out with my person as an example: I immediately start to feel this lump in my throat and I get anxious and fearful it’s something bad or someone they shouldn’t be texting and I shut down. I am constantly suspicious of everyone’s motives around me..relationships, friends, coworkers, etc... it’s like I just see red flags everywhere when people speak or interact with me and I over analyze EVERYTHING to look for those red flags. My feelings for people can turn on and off so quickly. Usually I date someone for a month or two then they say or do something even small that I read into too much then feelings are gone and not recoverable for a period of time. I fall HARD and QUICK for people then it’s like it slowly simmers out as I find little things I see as a red flag, BUT then I can’t cut it off... like I don’t want them but also don’t want them to leave either... 🙃It doesn’t help that my ex husband was extremely abusive mentally, sexually, and sometimes physically. I can’t tell if I just have CPTSD or if I’m presenting with BPD. Has anyone else been misdiagnosed with bipolar first? Or have any similar experiences? I understand nobody is a medical professional and just looking to see if anyone can relate to my situation. Thank you! ❤️"
does anyone with “quiet BPD” ever wish they were more explosive?,24,mixldx,9,"please note: first i want to acknowledge that having more implusive and explosive BPD is very difficult and i want to make sure you know i’m not trying to fantasise it on purpose. 

i tend to act in and just withdraw myself. i’ll write paragraphs in notes and never send them. or ill rant to myself about them. cry and generally feel like shit. but sometimes i wish i had the guts to lash out. 

it’s usually my first impulse but i fight it off and just stay isolated and depressed. 

this only vanishes when i’m with my family though — it’s mostly built up from the trauma they’ve caused me. but with my friends i rarely rarely ever go “crazy” and cut someone off. I think i’ve only done it 3 times but it was necessary. and if i do i still feel a bit guilty.

also i used to be an alcoholic but managed to cut wayyy down. and now only drink and parties and very rarely. but i sometimes wish i was back where i was a few years ago and i was messy. 

i mean i’m basically addicted to weed now and do get upset without it but can force myself about a week sober before i crack. 

i think it’s mostly cause i want people to take me more seriously about my illness. specifically my family cause then maybe they’d take me seriously. and sort of as a cry for help. 

i’m very great full i’ve come a long way with healing but there’s that part of me that doesn’t want to get better and it sucks cause i deserve to be and i know that. but fuck the split thinking is stressful as hell."

Whats your reason to go on living with NPD/BPD?,3,mj6vjy,3,"Why do you guys feel life is worth living? I have a diagnosis of NPD and BPD and I’ve been having trouble accepting that my life is still worth living. My current therapist “doesn’t do diagnosis” but I know I have cluster B (typically cycling between presentations but usually more vulnerable). It is clear to me that this is the problem and I even had it confirmed by my previous psych when I asked him point blank. My current therapist is just trying to help me improve by not focusing on it and I really am doing my best to trust him, but I can’t stop myself from focusing on the fact that I have NPD and BPD. Anytime I try to shift my focus on my childhood like he wants (he is more into cPTSD angle which I get) when I remember that I have these issues I feel so deeply ashamed and embarrassed and like it is a cop out for me to ignore it. I always thought the point of life was to love each other and to try and make the world a more fair and equal place. The older I get, the more I realize that this is my disorders talking. My NPD tells me the world is not good and that I / everyone need to try and fix it even though it is an impossible task, and my BPD tells me the only point of life otherwise is to love others when really I should be loving myself. Ironically, i have a paraphilia for weight gain that makes it extremely difficult (impossible) for me to have fulfilling intimate relationships and enjoy normal sex. I have had many relationships but they have all been rough and I am unable to connect or get pleasure intimately which partners do not like long term even though I get them off physically. I also cannot in good faith have kids for obvious reasons, which makes me sad but I can handle that. I am beginning to realize that healthy people seem to be living life for the purpose of enjoying the moment, chasing dreams, and just being happy discovering and being who they are. I am not able to enjoy these activities as is. I am bogged down by constantly trying to fix myself so that I can do these things and blend in to live a normal life but the fight seems impossible. It is my understanding that particularly narcissism is not treatable and that my physical brain is wired to be this way and unlikely to change. My previous psych said yeah you meet criteria for NPD but we can’t do much to fix it and wanted to focus on other things instead. I don’t see what the point of living is if I am a narcissist. I am deeply disturbed by this and I hate myself for it even though I understand cognitively it is not my “fault” I feel it is my responsibility to fix. I am so bothered that i can’t fix it and humiliated to be this type of monster so I try and hide from the world but it is really hard to be so alone and ashamed all the time. I want to kill myself because I know I am a monster, but I don’t want to be selfish and killing myself seems like the most narcissistic thing I could do really which defeats the purpose. I am struggling to come up with a reason to live other than that it would be bothersome to others if I killed myself, but I also feel that my existence is harmful just being here sucking up oxygen and burdening others like some sort of monster. I am wondering what other people who have these disorders focus on as a reason to live or a purpose I guess in these circumstances and how you cope with accepting that narcissism is not possible to change? I’m sorry to ask this here, I tried posting on narcissist Reddit but they do not accept posts like this because they consider it harassment to refer to narcissism as a problem. I know there is a lot of overlap and a lot of people with dual diagnosis in cluster B so I just thought I’d see if anyone here has any advice."
"In a moment of fear and desperation, I asked my live-in ex to get back with me. I now fully regret it.",1,mjcxu6,0,"He is a selfish  cheater, semi narcissist in his own ways. It had a big hand in making me eventually verbally abusive from snapping mentally. So He/we are toxic. He has never seen ME break up with him nor immediately NOT run back back to him. He was taken aback how I ran off to my brother’s for a few weeks to cool off and never called him

When I came back  he was being way way way too nice. He didn’t ask to be back with me but it was clear he was buttering me up. In that moment I got weak. He looked so handsome. I wanted his warmth and I wanted security. Basically all the wrong reasons to fall for him again. But I was impulsive + I realized I would face living in the projects which are pretty awful, I cried to him &  blamed his ways on myself and promised to do better (ie. be a doormat) and asked if he wanted to work things out.He looked so happy and relieved and also said he was sorry for being a liar. He was on the brink of tears and looked at me as if thinking 
“Omg maybe she really will change this time and omg I love her”

He said happily
“Ok well let’s see” 
as in he really wants to but needs to see if I changed (hahahaaha like as if I’m all to blame and am the only one who needs change) 

But soon after I felt like I gave back my power to him, let myself be re-shackled to him, to this lonely golden cage. Here I have no immediate needs that cannot be met. He is happy to provide. But he also becomes UNhappy if I express unhappiness about his selfish habits, lack of romance, lying ways, and evidence of cheating. Most especially he is annoyed at me for being traumatized and resentful by it all 

All I can think to do, is never mention  anything about getting back together again. Say nothing. Ask for nothing more other than essentials. Work on getting ssi and housing, and split. 

Because I know what ultimately makes him happy is me not talking much when he gets home, not asking for much, not expecting romance or exciting dates or conversations. He just wants an invisible housewife"
I thought I was doing better but now I’m splitting again.. (TW),1,mjckg1,0,"TW for self harm

Hi guys. It’s been a while. I was doing okay. Pretty good, actually! But now things are spiraling again.

My ex and I broke up because he was toxic, manipulative, and tried to use me on so many occasions. We were long distance, but he introduced me to one of his long distance friends.

Her and I hit it off so well! And she’s so accepting of my coexisting mental problems (primarily OSDD) and has never been rude or anything about it. And she says I’m a wonderful friend and gives me all these compliments!

But now I feel like she’s becoming distant? Things have been hard for her recently, and I’ve been supporting her to the best of my ability. However, our conversations are becoming shorter over the last two days, and now I’m getting very very scared. She’s been acting off. And she won’t open up to me. I know my ex has been >!cutting himself regularly, and posts about it in his statuses!<.

Now, BPD brain has come to the conclusion that she hates me and does not want to talk to me ever again. So now I’m getting really scared. I didn’t know she was my FP until now. I didn’t know I became so dependent.

Why am I like this? I’m so scared. And so angry. Why can’t she just love me (platonically) like I love her? Is there an underlying reason for this? Why am I so illogical? I don’t understand anymore! I want to know peace but I’m panicking. She’s the only friend I have who’s inclusive and doesn’t care about the personality disorder shit."
Close friend (22F) of 4 years isn’t comfortable being with me (21M) in her apartment without a third person present,0,mjgwbk,11,"I don’t think this is a personal thing, I think this is just a general rule that this person lives by, and I respect that—I was the one who suggested that she might not be comfortable in this situation in the first place. But it is still a shock and hurts a lot that this friend doesn’t trust me enough to be alone around me. We’ve been on walks together and spent plenty of time 1 on 1 at school. Our friendship is 100% platonic and I would never think of crossing a boundary, and I’ve never felt any attraction to her regardless. It just feels very strange that I’m seen as a potential aggressor; I would be all for her being cautious with people she knows only moderately well, but we know each other about as well as anyone knows us. 

Can any men or women offer some perspective here, or suggestions on how I can cope with the irrational insecurity that I might be abusive at heart?"

Need help supporting GF with BPD Episodes,12,mj0i3k,15,"So my girlfriend has been having frequent episodes, every night or every other night. Now I totally realize that there isnt any ""solve-all"" answer for episodes, and at least from my position (not to mention long distance) the best I can do is offer advice and my love.

However, if theres absolutely ANY advice someone can offer in helping calm her down during episodes and keep her spirits lifted, from the perspective of someone else with BPD, i'd be happy to have it. Because whilst im not struggling at supporting her, the advice is still very useful to have.

Did everything I was supposed to in order to move on but 2 years later I still can’t let go of my ex,6,mj2glf,9,"My ex and I broke up in March 2019 and I’ve been in a new relationship since May 2019. We haven’t spoken to each other once since the breakup (he broke up with me via email🤠)- he’s liked a few of my social media posts but I block him every time he shows up on my socials. I just can’t bear it. I miss him so much. And my new boyfriend is so much more stable, honest, and loving. But I just miss my ex so fucking much and two years later I still feel physically sick when I think about him being with anyone else. Maybe its because I didn’t realize the last time i saw him would be the last time. Maybe it’s because my new relationship doesn’t have that same undeniable passion that my ex and I had.  I just don’t know why it won’t stop hurting two years on... at this point I don’t think it’ll ever stop hurting. god I miss him so much.  it really makes me feel sick knowing that I still struggle so much without him whereas I imagine that he is completely fine without me ...  does anyone relate or have any advice?

Last night I had a bit of an unleashing on my FP.,1,mjbqov,3,"I was sending a lot of text to my ex. He is, still constantly on my mind. He has told me over and over to basically leave him alone. I’ve done ok for almost 2 weeks. Then out of nowhere I went off on him. I have to say with all honesty that I was drunk. I do not remember all the things I said. I do remember him telling me to stop in a few text. I am having a lot of guilt and shame right now and I’m afraid to go back and read all the mean things I’m sure I said. I need some advice, should I go read what I wrote? Would it be helpful, or does it matter, should I delete?"
Idk,12,mizfjk,5,"I have nothing special to say so I’m not expecting any responses. The BPD is just running wild rn so time to vent

I feel like I don’t want to go to others and vent about my problems so to not be a pain to them but then I get to a point where I feel so shit that I don’t care any more I just want someone to help me so I try to manoeuvre the conversation to where they can ask me how I am but they never ask. Most of them at least. Some of them do sometimes

I’ve had too many friends block me lately and it always leads to me thinking that I’m just horrible to talk to or something. Idk how I am but it seems to be the logical conclusion to go to.

I had some proper social time for the first time in ages and I did the thing where I come out of my shell too much. I don’t want to consciously restrict how much I talk or what I do. I want to enjoy my time with people. But I don’t want to come across as weird or anything negative, which will likely happen when I come out of my shell too much. I also don’t want to stop myself too much and be too quiet either. It’s an awful dilemma 

I don’t expect any responses but they’re appreciated. I’m just feeling so bad over all of this stuff rn"
What are some jobs that you all can manage?,0,mjate1,8,"If you work, what sort of jobs have been the most manageable? What factors go into that? Or if you are in school, what are you studying/planning to do (it's so hard to stick to one path...)"

Who else gets seething jealousy when it comes to others?,10,mizv68,2,"I know jealous isn't exactly a BPD trait, but I feeling like having BPD makes jealousy a thousand times worse. I don't know how to be happy for others when something good happens to them. I just wish I was them and hate myself that I can't be like them. Watching my friend do her project for class and seeing everyone tell her how good it was, and rightfully so.  I couldn't help but fucking start hating my self right then and there because, fuck, why can't I be like that? Why can't I be that likable where the minute you walk into a room everyone just gets so fucking happy? When I walk into a room full of people I get nervous and occasionally lose control and lash out. I'm trying my hardest to be better, but who am I kidding? I  know my ""better"" still won't ever be decent. 

&#x200B;

She's been doing so well for herself lately, meanwhile I discovered who I really am which was an unstable, splitting asshole who can't go more than two days without having some emotional meltdown. I felt so horrible today that I had to call the suicide hotline and while talking I realized maybe my ""jealousy"" is really just my fear of her abandoning me for better people. I can't stand the fact that she might realize that I'm weighing her down and there's better people out there for her and she has no need for me. I can't blame her."
"Started therapy, feels like I don’t need it anymore after breakup",3,mj4g00,5,"I’ve recently started therapy after waiting for so long to get accepted. Around the same time I broke up with my then boyfriend and started new medication which works great.

Getting over him was so much easier than I thought and things have only been going up since then. 

The problem now is: I only have issues with my BPD during relationships which means I’m sitting in therapy and she is asking me if I thought about hurting myself again and other stuff. I didn’t. That’s great, no self harm anymore. No arguments that get way too heated. Nothing.

But how can I get help for my future me now that I don’t have ANY issues at the moment? I can’t explain my therapist anything anymore now that I feel alright. I’m scared I’ll get “kicked out” again because they might thing I’m alright now?

I promised myself to not jump into the next thing again (I barely had any time in between my previous relationships, you know how it goes lmao). And I’m great at keeping it like that at the moment! I’m actually feeling alright and that’s nice but I feel like if therapy goes “bad” now and I have a new boyfriend some day that it will just start all over again. Just because I currently fail to explain to her of what’s usually wrong.

Is there anything I can do without forcing myself into a bad situation?

I kind of need someone else’s view on this, it’s also a little bit of venting I think?"
Feeling loved and cared about in hospital.,1,mj992q,1, I am a borderline and bipolar person who just recently started having trouble with si and sh. And I just realized why I was hoping from hospital to hospital. I feel more cared for in a hospital then I do at home or at college. Do any other borderlines feel this way?
I need to hear survival stories. I'm terrified my bpd wife will take off with my child never to be seen again.,4,mj30xt,8,"95% of the time she's the best wife anyone can ever have. Extremely loving, super understanding, same taste in everything, cooks the best healthiest food, including baking our own bread and pizza. She's very well read, incredible sex and lovebombing all day long, we agree on almost all topics etc. But 5% of the time when she'll have a meltdown over an argument, it only spirals into one thing. Every. Single. Time. No matter how big, small, trivial it is, the end result is the same: ""I don't want to be with you anymore"". Then she looks for plane tickets and starts packing her things. These meltdowns used to happen biweekly but I was able to learn how to avoid them, and now they happen every 4-6 weeks. Not bad at all. 

And it's not a bluff. She actually means it and I know she does. Then it takes a guantaran effort on my behalf to apologize for everything regardless of what I believe, and calm her down till she's back to loving me.

Here's the thing. It's a little difficult for her to leave these days for the following reasons:

1) We're in a foreign country, but we're moving to her country next month. I'll be the foreigner on a visa. 
2) She's unemployed, but might be in the future. That said, she has enough savings to last her a decade and can live at her vacant family home, while I poured all my savings into the marriage. 
3) We don't have children yet, and 99% of her time on Instagram is looking at babies and wanting to have one so badly. 

This might all change soon. We're moving to her country, she might get a job and she might get pregnant soon. I fear that when the next meltdown happens, it will be much  less complicated to just pack and leave. Only then, I won't see my child again, and will spend my time and money chasing custody. It's not how I want to spend the next decade. 

I need to hear success stories here. Did anyone have similar fears? Did they materialize?

Edit: BPD runs in her family, she has a divorced aunt who has it. She hasn't been formally diagnosed, and hasn't started DBT due to the pandemic etc. We're hoping when we move back to her country we can get that started."
"When the one person in the world that you wish understood you, doesn’t",3,mj47dc,4,"So tonight while I’m at work for whatever reason my husband decides to go through my room. I sleep alone and he sleeps on the couch. He tells me he found my pink bag. It’s the one with my gear in it. Instead of sitting down with me and telling me that he found my stuff, and show some concern or care.. he shakes his head and goes “you’re on drugs?” He towers over me with a DISGUSTED look on his face while I’m cooking. Looking down at me like I’m just a piece of shit that doesn’t deserve to live. So he puts me on the spot, attacks me, and causes me to become so uncomfortable in my own skin? I suddenly feel like sinking into the floor. I truly have been doing so good at keeping this a secret. We’ve been together for almost 9 years, married for 2. (We’ve always been on and off but things were actually going pretty well and so we decided to get married and finally get our shit together and focus on our little family. Once we got married things went downhill again). He had no clue about my addiction, though I only started using about 3 years ago. It never hurt anyone, I function fine. it was the one thing that I had to myself. It was my safe place, something only I knew about and I liked that. And he has to always TAKE everything from me. Well tonight he just took my soul away. Then you know what he says to me? “Who are you fucking for your drugs?” Like.. is that all that’s on your mind? Not fear that the woman you married, the mother of your children can OD at any moment? Not concern and worry that you may lose me? But your ego is more important.. okay. Way to make me feel like a worthless junkie that nobody really gives a fuck about. Just the way he looks at me just makes me want to die. He looks right through me like he’s lost all respect for me. I don’t know about you.. but if I just found out someone I really love and care about uses.. I’d give them a big fucking hug. I’d tell them that they don’t need to keep it a secret anymore. That I am here for them. I get how hard it is to just quit. Ask them what’s going on in their lives that is causing them to do this. Not fucking attack them! I can’t deal with this feeling eating at me from the inside. I feel so dirty. So worthless. He keeps cornering me to tell me who I’m getting my shit from, because I don’t he flushes everything I had down the toilet. Is he trying to fucking kill me????? Then he goes right back to playing his video games and ignores me the rest of the night. Like am I nothing? I feel like he did that just to make me feel like shit. I think he wants to see me suffer. There is so much I wish I could talk to him about. So much that I keep bottled up because it’s like talking to a wall with him. I could pour my heart out to him, bawl my eyes out and be on my knees begging for him to just listen to me and try to get me.. and he will not budge. I learned about love languages.. he definitely has more of the physical affection love language. He only is nice to me when he wants sex which we haven’t had in like a year. I just can’t have sex with him anymore. I feel like I’m just being used and I’d rather die than feel that feeling again plus my sex drive is dead now. I’m just not attracted to him anymore because all I see is a lazy fucking asshole. He doesn’t admit UNTIL THIS DAY that he used to hit me. He choked me out against the wall until I passed out with my oldest son in his arms when he was only about 2! When his family ganged up on me and his dad tried to hit me he actually grabbed ME and pulled ME back. I think that was the day I realized he doesn’t give two fucks about me. Back in 2013 my mom passed away. My ex showed up at her funeral and my husband (we weren’t married at the time) made me feel like complete shit with his passive aggressive bullshit and starts a fight with my ex in front of everyone. I’ll never forgive him for that. Actually finally writing all of this out loud makes me realize how much of a toxic, selfish fuck he is. He doesn’t take my BPD seriously, matter of fact he uses it against me. When I split and go ballistic he actually laughs at me or just leaves because he’s “tired of it”. Calls me names every day. Psycho bitch, stupid cunt.. tells me GET HELP. Not, “I’m here for you and I love you. I’m gonna help you through this and be there for you every step of the way.” He makes me literally terrified to seek help. Because of the way he mocks and ridicules me about the way I am, makes me feel like no one in the world will ever take me seriously. Like I’m actually a burden to even associate with. Like no therapist, no doctor can ever help me. He jokes that I need to be institutionalized and put down like a dog. He loves to always bring up my past, even though he knows it triggers my episodes. I just don’t understand how I ended up with someone with so little emotion and I have all the fucking emotions. I just need him to be THERE. How the fuck can someone treat me this way for years and I still keep him around?  Like seriously.. a person can only take so much. I’ve tried to make things work for the sake of our kids but I’m at my breaking point. The thing is.. I don’t ask for much. I’m falling apart more by the minute. To think all I needed was for him to be there for me.."
"I feel like the world is out to get me, even though I don’t do anything these days...",1,mj91yy,1,"Just getting this off my chest. I’ve had the worst adolescence/young adult life & I am constantly feeling like I cannot grow because of the things that happened, & continue to happen, to me. 

• 2013-15 (age 15-18) I was in a turbulent relationship that ended just before my 18th birthday on an interstate trip because my boyfriend broke my trust about drugs, something that was kind of hard to do considering we did the same drugs. I was toxic that whole relationship, cheated on him & self-harmed in front of him. Was a raging alcoholic. 

• 2015-16 I dated several boys that I completely fucked over in various ways due to alcoholism & undiagnosed BPD, but also am dealing with being abused by my work place which is causing me to panic, & not getting paid. 

• 2016-18 I moved countries & had multiple turbulent relationships there, burnt out, suicidal & drinking. All this time I’ve been actively self-harming. Get kicked out of familiy’s place in foreign country, feel left out & fucked up. Come back to my home country after being fired from my job for shaving my head. 

• 2017 I fall in love with a boy but fuck it up by overstaying my welcome & he’s really immature. He is my FP. I decide to start healing. It’s rocky but I’m trying now. Every day I imagine us together & it *hurts*

• 2017 I am raped by a tinder date. I start dating a different boy & completely settle down, thinking he is my refuge of stability. 

• 2018 I spend some time in the psych ward for being chronically suicidal. Get fired/quit from my job on a day I nearly killed myself by a girl who is financially abusing me.** still obsessing over fantasy of FP who I have no contact with

• 2019 Discover I’m polyamorous & he doesn’t understand. I cheat on him, but it’s different this time. It’s with my FP from 2017, & he’s matured beyond belief. 

• 2019 we move in together, we’re in love it’s great 

• 2020 abusive housemates, a friend leaves his girlfriend, my best friend, dying of an overdose in my house because he broke up with her after she got psychosis. I took her in. She threw it in my face along with another girl who abused my household that I ended up butting heads with. I start dating the idiot who ditched dying girl in my house. He turns out to be a narcissist & abuses, gaslights & cheats on me** with the girl who financially abused me 

• 2020 my cat dies just after his 1st birthday. I have feelings that it’s my fault as it’s the only time he’s been out at night that long (I really tried to get him in but he wouldn’t come, & when he was coming in... was hit by a car. I cried for 3 days.) 

• 2021...... still suicidal & terrified of almost everything except my boyfriend & being here in my house. Constantly there’s little fights or drama I get brought into because of my kind heart, not my BPD. I feel so lost & alone. I have no money to heal with my community at events etc.. I am so suicidal all the time. 


I can only take so much. & these are only the major events. Childhood was bad. I’m currently in therapy & trying to get diagnosed as autistic, instead of BPD. I feel misunderstood."
HOW do I shut off my idealization?,1,mj8u7t,1,"I have a huge problem in idealizing people I want as partners. I had this issue with my last ex where nothing he could do would be wrong. I would excuse awful behaviors, and he would treat me like crap. I told myself he was misunderstood, or I would just rationalize bad behavior. 
I wanted to move onto something new after a year of trying to find happiness in myself and I met someone who actually SHOWED me they were a good person. Turns out, he is a master at lying and has a girlfriend of over 3 years and has a whole plan laid out to get away with it. This is someone I was friends with for over 10 years so it was a huge bummer to be let down as a friend, have my trust shattered, my health at risk, and honestly — what I should see as the end of the entire thing. I should not put up with someone who treats me this way, and if he wanted something more like I did, starting a relationship on lies and with cheating is just not happening.
So why do I struggle so much with ending this? I keep telling myself the same crap I told myself with my ex. Maybe he is misunderstood, maybe he’s too shy to end it with her, maybe I am misunderstanding something too.. like maybe he was always a piece of shit and I am just so caught up in my head creating false hopeful realities I missed it. 
I had my ex tell me once I never listen to him. he said that I seem like I do but then spin it my way. and I know he is right on that. How in the world do I stop this?

I never devalue people either. I just kind of give up after some point in time but sadly *in the past* i would take them back. new me is not doing that, but I just can’t stand how I put people on a pedistal and I never mean anything to them, even though they make me feel that way."
Everyone seems to think that I'm just exaggerating?,1,mj8rsy,2,"I've been dealing with moderate to severe mental health issues for 5 to 6 years now. I struggled with bulimia, severe long depression, anxiety, self harm, suicidal ideation etc... since about 6 month ago I've had tics. The tics kind of gradually started and become a lot more noticeable once I started to acknowledge them.

I feel like whenever I try and talk to anyone about my mental health symptoms, especially my closest friends, they just don't answer me and avoid the conversation? They seem to think I am just reading into all these different conditions and that's why I am still unwell. They clearly think I am just exaggerating and wanting to be unwell. 

I find it extremely upsetting to be confronted with that, because one of my biggest triggers is feeling invalidated and misunderstood. 
Yes I do read into many conditions, and yes probably I wouln't dwell on things as much if I didn't.... but I am reading into them because I have all these issues that no-one seems to get?
I feel like they all just want me to stop talking about it and that makes me feel completley isolated. I feel like no-one gets that I am really stuggeling with all these things, I am not just making it up? 

Well, I mean maybe they are right and I should just stop making my mental health much of a focus. I just feel like it is such a big part of me and it seems to consume so much of my life, I wouln't know how to shut it out without making things worse?

I am honestly really doubting myself right now and couln't really use some perspective."
Does anyone else get random thoughts that you would be happy if the people you love died?,6,mj0gay,6,I get these reoccurring thoughts every so often it makes me feel so bad afterward and I feel like I’m a terrible person. Get I’ll get thoughts like “oh I’d be happy if my dog died. Or even my grandpa and even writing that makes me cry. I don’t know why I randomly get them but I feel so bad cus I love these people and animals so much. I don’t want these people to die I wouldn’t be happy I would be devastated.
What are your biggest triggers?,7,mj0eyj,3,"I feel like I need to talk triggers with people who GET IT. I can’t help it when I flip out sometimes-trust me I do not want this. It’s embarrassing; I feel immature and toxic.

What are your biggest triggers? Do you have any particular coping mechanisms?

The first for me is feeling embarrassed/shamed in some kind of way when I have my guard down...for example in a rare instance that I feel happy and am not “watching” myself/my actions. 

Another is not feeling loved/wanted by my partner. Feeling rejected...which then leads me to project all my self loathing onto them. 

Both lead my down the BPD rabbit hole in a major way."
help help help !,3,mj27c1,4,"how do i stop myself from idealising guys? i really liked this guy and now it’s worn off.. he likes me and my feelings are now barely there.. how do i get them back because i’ve been interested in him for two years on instagram and we started talking few months ago, i was super interested and we met up multiple times.. and now nothing :/ i feel nothing.. 

:/ i also just started anti psychotics so maybe that had something to do w it but ah! i want my feelings back because he is genuinely so good for me, he’s the first genuinely nice guy i’ve been into! the rest of my exes or love interests have all been manipulative and toxic.

I only exist if I talked to someone,55,mim58e,16,Does anyone need to talk to someone 24/7?

Intrusive thoughts about partner/relationship,2,mj4zgg,3,"I really feel like I need to share this somewhere because this is killing me. Share your thoughts in the comment section if you can relate!

I’ve been together with my boyfriend for a year now and find myself smothered with intrusive thoughts related to extreme jealousy and insecurity. This has been an ongoing problem for me for years since my first relationship.

The thoughts might revolve around my boyfriends past relationships, his female friends and my fear of not being lovable or attractive enough. These are just a few examples though. I feel like ANYTHING can trigger an intrusive thought like this. It can go on for weeks at a time and I feel absolutely drained and miserable and anxious. 

Everytime he goes out with his friends or I see a notification from a female friend of his on his phone screen, I most likely get an anxiety attack and have to put all my energy into getting the anxiety under control so that I could go on with my life. And it. Takes. Forever.

I try my absolute best to not be a toxic partner and I try to either hide these things from him or to express myself as healthy and nice as possible if I feel the extreme need to. 

I hate how jealous I can get. I would never let it take over my actions, but the emotion inside me just kills me and it’s literally hell. I don’t personally know anyone who would relate to this. 

I’ve been starting to consider breaking up with him for my BPD. Being in a relationship gives me so much anxiety, but I really love him and he loves me so I feel like I can’t just give up."
"Hopefully this is ok to post about, but I'm a gay man in love with my straight best friend who is also my secret FP",6,mj00bu,5,"My best friend is awesome. Very smart, athletic, easy to talk to. People gravitate towards him. He's very much liked and he's attractive too so it isn't uncommon for people to be into him. 

I didn't have feelings towards him beyond acknowledging that he's attractive and a good friend about 2 years ago, but over the last couple years we have gotten very close and have spent everyday (close to) together. And I still am frequently frustrated that we aren't closer. 

I want him to enjoy my company so much. I want him to love me as much as I love him. And it's getting harder and harder to lie to myself about how much I am falling for him. 

He's also my roommate."
Long rant. Overwhelmed.,3,mj1uv9,1,"I'm just so overwhelmed right now. I'm trying to get better for myself and not for other people but it's so hard. I don't want to be better for me if it means I can't have the person I'm in love with. I feel so angry about that. If getting better means I can have the person I love then it's just not fair. I'd rather throw myself under the bus for them to keep their love. Why can't getting better mean they'll love me more?

I'm watching my finances. I'm not drinking. I'm not doing drugs. I haven't self harmed. But I'm also isolating and refusing to accept certain things. I've done a few wreckless things here and there but nothing life threatening. But I'm struggling so hard to get better for me because that's what they want me to do. But it isn't fair. I'm doing it for them really and saying it's for me. I'm getting better against my own will because I want them to love me back like I love them but it isn't certain that will ever happen. And it isn't fair. It feels like I'm being forced to love myself and the crazy thing is I hate it. I don't want to love me for me if they won't love me back."
Does the BPD cycle have to occur frequently?,0,mjb7ea,2,"In other words, people talk about turbulent relationships. Can it also occur in this way?

Ever since 5 months into our relationship, I’ve felt like if he leaves me or something happens to our relationship that i’ll have to pass away. It tears me up inside to think about it and it’s my biggest fear. I’m so young and these feelings are so overwhelming and I just want to know if anyone else relates...I don’t know how to explain the feeling but it’s almost unbearable and makes me want to end my life now.I have anxiety attacks over it pretty often I don’t think I could live life without him nor would I ever want to.

How do you get validation/reassurance in a healthy way?,3,mj2601,1,"I feel like I'm starving for validation/reassurance all the time. I not only try to seek reassurance that my FPs don't hate me and aren't going to leave me, but I also seek validation/reassurance that I'm  attractive, that I'm capable, and that I'm a good person (morally speaking). It's like I don't exist apart from the mirror they hold up to me. 

If people aren't actively confirming these things about me all the time, I start to panic inside (I realize how irrational and unhealthy this is). I've noticed that I start to get angry at the people around me when they don't give me this reassurance, and then I will withdraw from them. As a side note, I'm curious whether this reflects NPD traits or whether this is just part of BPD. 

To affirm my attractiveness, I've tended to hook up with random people (pre-Covid) because I feel like I'm undesirable if I'm celibate. Since I attach to people too quickly, this has caused a huge amount of psychological pain for me and made me suicidal in the past because I felt disposable to the people I slept with (even though I  started sleeping with them primarily for validation rather than being in love with them). I want to stop this pattern because it's killing me. 

How do you get validation without using unhealthy behaviors or coming off as attention-seeking, manipulative, or desperate?"
DAE feel depressed and maybe s*icidal after hanging out with people? (Even when it was a good time),514,mi9yug,71,"No matter who I hang out with, or how good it was, I'll always feel empty and depressed after we finish hanging out. It happens all the time to the point where I dred having to end hang outs but that's not realistic or fair on them ofc.

I guess it has alot to do with the fact that I'll probably never see them again cuz they might abandon me, they might internally hate me, me not knowing who I am, and so on. Its hard for me to not feel awful after a good day out with people and I hate this instability"
Boundaries around opposite-sex friendships,1,mj6lu1,21,"Ok, if you ever read my posts I have huge fear from my bf having female friends. It is a trigger that totally destroys me.

I would be happy to get any ideas, suggestions of how to cope and establish boundaries in this aspect.

&#x200B;

What I want: No female friends. Maybe I am okay with some who are not super close with him and are not attractive. Still, it would be a trigger but it wouldn't disable me. lol.

What he wants: keeping all his female friends, who he seems to have many and many of them are also attractive. Basically, he doesn't want any limitations.

How could we find a common ground when we are basically on the opposite sides of the spectrum?

Please, any tips are appreciated!

Edit: i am in therapy since i am 12 and i do it intensively with a therapist specialized in BPD for 1.5 years. I needed to add this info since multiple comments suggested to get help. I already am in therapy.

What can I do to rekindle things with an ex,0,mj6lf1,4,"So it’s been about a year since my ex broke up with me because of my poor communication and her not feeling valued enough, her feeling like she made all the effort, And I became a push over. I believe these things are fixable and I want to put them right. I’ve been working on them since we have been apart.

However I’m not sure how I can restart it with her. We have spoken a couple of times even on the phone and they have all been quite pleasant. But I get the feeling that she’s a bit standoffish, sometimes she’s interested and asks questions or initiates the conversation but often I find she’s a bit short with her answers and doesn’t try. I don’t blame her I just think she doesn’t want to get hurt and I completely understand that. 

So I’m wondering if anyone here would have any advice on how I could improve my current relationship with her get her to open up a little without seeming desperate or forceful? 

I’m currently stuck in a different country waiting for hotel quarantine to end so meeting up isn’t really an option."
Fell in love with my bestfriend who's in love with another person and I don't know what to do,3,mj1kdm,2,"Help. I'm about to block everyone again and delete everything and isolate myself. I fell in love with my bestfriend and he's in love with another person. What should I do? 
I know I'm gonna be hurt after this. He might forget about me and realize that I'm not worth it. He promised that he won't leave. But I know that's stupid and I don't believe it. And even if it's the truth I know he'll get tired of me eventually (and I think it's gonna happen soon).
I just don't know what to do. 
Part of me thinks leaving everything behind right now would be best. To protect myself and retain that not yet damaged image he has of me. 
I'm becoming to hate myself more... each passing day. I can't take it. 
I want to be happy for him and support him but I just go up and down in these intense feelings of happiness when I'm with him and wanting to die when he's with her.
Lately the emptiness has becoming more constant and intense. Their relationship is progressing and I'm being left behind. 
What's the best way out of this? 
I don't want to hurt him. 
But I also can't take these feelings."
"Just ordered Russel Meares' ""A dissociation model of borderline personality disorder"". Excited!",6,mixsfl,0,"I'm not familiar with his work and I've been through DBT many times for 2,5 years in total. I feel like I'm ready to go into the origins and hopefully find healing with working with Meares' method. I've also heard great things about the Kernberg model of transference work in therapy (which is more brutal for the patient and the therapist), but I feel I want to first read about this more compassionate model. 


Also, as I've been in therapy for many years I found it vital to have DBT as the grounding technique and method. But I feel it doesn't go deep into the root causes and I felt still incomplete and lacking of an identity, so to work on these second/third step methods, stability is a very good thing going forward. If anybody is interested I could do a review of the book here after reading it. Cheers to everybody on their journey :)"
Recommendations on Self-Help Books.,5,miyoaq,0,"I have realised I have a fearful avoidant attachment style. I have always liked guys who are emotionally unavailable. The first 5 people I have liked were straight but I always looking for the signs that were low-key interested and I would get depressed whenever they wouldn't reciprocate. The next guy even explicitly said he wasn't interested and I still fancied him for a year 🤡. The last guy, whilst he was gay this time, didn't want anything yet all the signs he was giving me that he wasn't interested, I dismissed. In hopes that there was something more to it.

Like, I know when someone isn't interested in me but I completely dismissed it for him? 🤡

I don't have money for therapists and so far, the counselling offered to me hasn't been of great help and I am looking for some self-help books or advice on how to tackle my issues. I want to 'love' normally but its so difficult."
I wish I had friends...,2,mj2p0k,1,"Friends who actually want to hang out/talk with me. Don’t get me wrong, I do have people that I consider friends who I chat with every once in a while through text. Sometimes over a phone call too but not often. I moved states a few years back and haven’t made too many new friends locally. I’m not sure what I’m doing wrong as a friend but it’s just been so lonely the past year hardly seeing anyone."

I'm irritable and paranoid. I feel like I can't trust anyone. I want to cut everyone off but I only have two people left.
I'm so angry that nothing I do can make this better. Therapy I think will only help me handle my emotions. This will help me keep healthy relationships because I'll learn to not react negatively I guess. But what about me? When can I stop feeling these negative emotions. Its too much. I feel like everything about getting better with bpd is for the people around us and not actually to help the person with bpd.

I'm not diagnosed... I'm sorry. I'm very sure I have it. I'm just having a hard time getting myself help."
is it bad that i’m best friends with someone’s fp?,9,miulqb,6,"i don’t know if this is the right subreddit / way to ask this but i’m still learning and need advice, since i myself don’t have bpd but want to be more accepting to my friend who does. (i’m also not too good with social cues as i’m autistic)

hi so my friend (we’ll call them A) has bpd, and i know that their fp is another one of my friends (who we’ll call B). A and B have always been super close, but lately they’ve stopped being as close bc B and i are becoming better friends. 

since B and i have gotten closer ive had this intense vibe that A hates me (even tho we used to be best friends), and they’ve also been making kinda passive aggressive anon posts (things like they’ll tweet “im angry that you exist” but not say who it’s about)

should i back off? i’d never want to hurt A or make them hate me, they’re very important to me, but so is B, who has been there for me when no one else was. i cant control what A or B think of me but i know i can control how i handle the situation on my own. what should i do? /gen"
(M22) Would someone with BPD completely lie through of their teeth constantly if it meant you would feel better about them in a certain way?,0,mjea0k,21,My girlfriend (F22) has BPD. Lately this week she’s been extremely lazy and she’s not getting any exercise. She knows I don’t really appreciate it when she’s lazy. She thinks she’s fat (she’s not) and has constant fears that I will leave her because of that (I won’t) She tells me she’s been going for 30 min morning jogs for the last 3 days. When I go and see her it doesn’t seem like she’s moved at all. Would she lie to me?
Struggling with first breakup since diagnosis.,5,miy2i9,6,"We were engaged. He cheated on me. Told me he blocked her and not to worry about her. This was like a month ago. 

I woke up today to being blocked and banned on everything. Using sleuth skills and alt accounts found out he’s openly dating her starting today and he changed all his main account pfps to happy pics of them together. 

Also we shared a friend group and they all went with him. 

No amount of therapy has prepared me for this. I read stuff about breakups but they don’t get how this reacts with my BPD. I really don’t know how to cope. How do you manage a breakup like this with BPD??"

How in the fuck do you control your emotions?,5,miytya,8,"Hey all. Soooooo, after a long while of not bothering with girls or feelings or relationships or anything, I've found myself unintentionally catching some feels :l

Now when I get a crush on someone, my brain just spirals out of control. The idealizations and fantasies I catch myself in the middle of (not the sexual kind to be clear), the deep need to be around this person, talking to them, getting to know them, spending time with them, anything. Its like my brain reserves a spot for something like this, and when the feelings are caught, thats all thatd occopied by this space and its alwayssss there.

Like fuck, I love liking someone, just seeing them makes my day, but my brain is such a little bitch it doesnt want to quit all the overdrive overthinking. Just a beehive of bullshit lol.

Now sure, regardless of how strongly I feel about people, you might be thinking ""just ask them out"". Now I would, BUT theres a bf/ex bf still around and idk what the whole situation is and Im not about to be that dickhead thats like ""dump this guy"", and its probably not a good idea anyways to suggest a relationship right after one has ended. Id love to get to know her more and we're gonna hangout as friends n shit and thats all I want/want myself to want right now. 

BUT

MY BRAIN IS GOING DOWN THIS RABBIT HOLE OF A SPIRAL AND IM WRESTLING IT EVERY SINGLE SECOND AS HARD AS I CAN WHILE FEELING EVERY LITTLE BIT OF IT WITH NO FILTER.

Like is this just what feelings are at this point when it comes to someone special in your life? How does anyone else manage it? Should I just avoid relationships my whole fucking life because my brain tears itself apart everytime I even have a smidge of feelings for someone? Should I say fuck it and just say I have feelings? Just..what should I do? Even just asking advice, I feel like Im cursing myself whenever I do and that the act of asking for it is what ruins me somehow.

Idk mannnn, shits fucky. Any responses at all are really appreciated, thanks all. Cheers"

BPD & Holidays,22,minp1n,7,"Does anyone else absolutely hate holidays and would so much rather skip over the day completely? They’re a big rage trigger for me. I think it goes back to being a small child and hating that my family pretended to be normal on holidays. Even as a kid, I could see right through the bullshit. I hated that I had a glimpse of what normal could be but that it would never actually be a reality. And I couldn’t enjoy it because I knew it was inauthentic. So now as a 27 year old, I have the same hatred toward holidays. I am just a completely unpleasant person to be around on them. Not that I’m a peach other days, but holidays like Easter drive me up a wall."
DAE also mirror down to even the littles things.,0,mj4ltg,0,"edit: i meant littlest, sorry

ive realized that whoever my FP is, my identity issues get worse. When i am not attached to someone, i still don’t know myself but there’s also less feelings and stress involved so it’s kind of just sitting there. With an FP, i literally become them. down to the amount of time i’m supposed to wait until i respond. if they like to message all day, i will like to message all day. if they like to be independent and only message me sometimes, i will convince myself that that is how i am also. i cannot decide anything for myself and i hate it. 

I will say, however, from my previous relationship onto this one i’ve stopped lying. I mean about ... “do you like carrot cake?” and i’d maybe say.. yes i love it. When really ive never had it. I’m proud of myself for this because i used to do that all the time so ensure that my FP and i were on the same track always. But i don’t know how to stop the other thing. 

It’s also i feel that whatever their love language is, mine automatically is the same, and then i question if it really is... and it’s a cycle. you know."
Catching feelings after two weeks...,8,mitvke,2,"(19f) So I met this guy two weeks ago and before meeting yesterday we had Netflix partied together and talked over discord. I was really nervous about him coming over but everything went great. 

I told myself from the very beginning that I did not want to date this guy at all, period. I was not interested. We sat on my bed together watching a movie and we were comfortable with each other. I was kinda sitting on my side and he was positioned behind me to where my butt was touching his lower thigh but we weren’t cuddling, hard to explain. He eventually moved his leg to where it was bent and resting partially on top of my thigh. 

Mentally I could not handle this because of me loving physical touch. He could have easily moved back. I mentioned that my cheeks were soft and without asking he touched one side (I had no problem with it). 

He also had his arms wrapped around the sloth stuffed animal that my ex and I had an inside joke and love for. I don’t know how it made me feel. 

So presently I’m obsessing over this all."
Help with coping after being abusive,2,mj1hpg,2,"Hi everyone,

New to the community. Recently referred by my doctor for therapy for BDP and am on a waiting list.

I am having a difficult time coping with the fact that I’ve been physically abusive to my husband in fits of rage. I get so angry that I almost black out and have no control. Unfortunately he has some scars now from where I once scratched him. I understand this isn’t an excuse and I don’t deserve forgiveness and shouldn’t expect it at this point. I know actions have consequences, but I feel god awful and cannot find a way to deal with this. We’ve been together since we were teenagers and are in our mid twenties now. I love this man so much but feel like I can’t help pushing him away and sabotaging our relationship. I have so much guilt and shame for my actions and feel like there is no recovering from this. He says he wants to be with me and I need to focus on myself and my mental health right now but I can’t find a way to do that when I look back at how toxic I’ve been."
Why keep going?,6,miudaj,1,"Nothing matters to me more than dying. Im just waiting for an accident so that I can avoid being blamed for my passing. There is no point of living with this curse. Literally no point. No amount of therapy, hospitals, drugs, friends, or whatever else can change this. Ive been dreaming of the day i die for over 12 years. I just need a way that looks like an accident. Or for my therapist to finally sign the papers for assisted suicide, if its even legal for me. I beg her constantly but she wont do it."
I'm pretty sure I messed it up for good,2,miyzph,7,"My ex and I remained friends after dating for 2.5 years...We still hang out and talk, once in awhile hook up. We said we'd be up front if another person came into our lives. Well, he lied. I found out today he's been with someone else, then rejected me sexually which really fucking hurt. Part of me thought he would come back eventually, that 2020 was just a bad year and he would find his way back into my life romantically. I humiliated myself again and became overwhelmed with emotions. I cried, and begged him not to leave, came off desperate as hell. No wonder he doesn't want to be with me. He said he's not emotionally or mentally attracted to me. I poured myself into that relationship and it still wasn't good enough. I feel so unloved and unwanted.
He also said if a new woman came into his life, he would leave it up to her to see if he and I could be friends. I was devastated....considering when he was with me, he lied about another girl he'd dated prior but still talked to (which would have been fine if he didn't hide it), and I set boundaries about them talking. He refused to respect them and now he would do it to me. I currently am feeling lowest of the low."
i need help finding perspective.,2,mj1124,1,"CW: sh, suicidal thoughts, drug/alcohol mention. // vent

i can’t remember the last time i sh’d, it was 2018 or 19. i think i was drunk and ended up ruining the party.. it served as a wake up call and i stopped. i’m still struggling, but i’ve cone so far just on my own, learning to regulate and be mindful and differentiate between trauma triggers and present moment situations. my therapist is suggesting that since my symptoms are much quieter than they used to be, that my bpd might be cptsd. regardless, i’m symptomatic right now, and the last time i felt like this was when my supposed borderline was *really* bad. 

i’m not suicidal anymore, i mean, i know better. i tried that, it was horrible. i’ve grown a lot and i do love life, but right now i’m back in a house where a lot of my childhood/adolescent trauma took place. and it’s worse now. my mother is genuinely emotionally abusive (to my BABY siblings) and to me when i try and speak up. shes projecting onto me, giving me unfair ultimatums (if you don’t like the way i talk to the kids, you can find somewhere else to live), generally just being venomous (for a reason, but not one that has anything to do with me or my siblings). i get that shes in a toxic/emotionally abusive relationship, but shes not willing to do anything about it and shes taking it out on us. she’s admitted to it too, she knows. so much old shit that i didn’t even know had hurt me is resurfacing, i’m having nightmares about her and i feel tired constantly when i spend any amount of time around her. even when shes not yelling, i’m scared that she’ll start. 

anyway. it’s triggering. i’ve had fleeting thoughts about sh since being back but always worked through it, and tonight in the car i literally couldn’t stop thinking “i want to fucking die i want to hurt myself” and then crying and mentally apologizing to the universe because i had fully intended to hurt myself when i got home. 

my 10y/o brother had just told me today that he feels like he’s always angry or sad and never anything else, and after a long yelling match between my mom and the children, (i jumped a few times when my mom shouted, it’s fucking scary.) he said that he doesn’t think any of us love him. my mom told him that he was just being manipulative, and i don’t fuck with that. he’s a kid, and i literally had a narcissistic father. i know manipulative and that isn’t it. i said “mom, he’s overwhelmed and doesn’t know how to express what he’s feeling. he’s too young to be genuinely manipulative, he has empathy so it’s not a disorder. anything he’s doing is something he learned from all of us.” and she started yelling at me again. 

i’d interrupted her earlier because she was shouting in a nasty tone for a solid minute when i got the point, which was literally just “roll the window up.” she got pissed when i said “i get it, okay” very calmly, and i told her that i have boundaries, and one of them is that i don’t allow people to talk to me in an abusive way. i get the point, and don’t need to hear or engage any more. she got louder and interrupted me back, talking about “oh, you wanna talk boundaries? you constantly tell me how to treat/raise the kids. you don’t get to tell me how to act. THATS a boundary-“ and essentially just said i had no respect. she completely disregarded my boundary and put her own in place, didn’t even acknowledge what i was communicating. i shut up because it wasn’t worth it to explain how she was seeing what she wanted to see and still being rude and causing me fear, that the dialogue she just used was basically just a page out of the narcissists book. 

back to the car w my brother, she was yelling that i was crossing HER boundaries and just kept getting louder and not leaving any room for me to breathe or express anything. i told her that i don’t feel safe around her when she acts that way, and she said that i don’t take any responsibility for my sense of safety and put all of the blame on her. (she has no idea how much work i do on myself. how deeply i dive into my trauma responses and toxic traits every day, so that i can understand them better and work on healing.) she said that i need to just find another place to live because i can’t listen. thats when i turned away and thought that it would be easier if i just died, imagined and briefly considered jumping out of the moving car, thought that i wanted the release of sh, thought that the only reason (exaggeration due to emotional overwhelm, but the feeling was real) i couldn’t end my life is because i have so many siblings and beautiful friends who would be traumatized. i thought that i wouldn’t care how she felt if i did, but at the same i knew that that was me deflecting and trying to protect my ego, and i felt guilty for letting her hatred rub off on me. (still deflecting, sorry.) 

right now, i’m typing this instead of hurting myself. i’m trying to be mindful, but i feel like a crazy person. i need to know that i’m not wrong, that this is genuinely fucked and that i’m not being some manipulative holier than thou asshole. i need to know that this isn’t my fault. i’m recognizing symptoms of panic/shock in my body. my limbs feel numb and my jaw is clenched to the point of hurting, and i think i’m holding my breath. i can’t tell if i’m sweating because of this or because its too hot in the house.. my heart is racing even though i’m weirdly still and spaced out. i want to scream and punch the wall until i bleed, but i feel the numbness setting in. (i won’t do any of that, but i need to express the feeling before i shut it out completely.) 

does it.. does it make sense that i would be triggered to sh? i used to do it all the time at her house to cope w this stuff, and it was somewhat less frequent back then. am i being unfair by saying that i feel unsafe around her? nothing i try works and all that i can think of to do it turn the feeling back on myself. i’ve tried talking to her, letting her vent, saying that what she’s doing isn’t okay. i tried sending her a “signs of emotional abuse” article to help her see what she’s describing from her husband (and maybe get her to see what she’s doing) but as far as i know she hasn’t read it. nothing works, and even once i leave my siblings still have 14-8 years of this. that kills me."
DAE have physical symptoms from neglect of personal care?,11,miq3vl,6,Example I was too depressed to get out of bed for long periods of time even to take care of myself and say brush my teeth and got minor periodontitis (I’m 22 about to be 23 thought only old people get this shit).  Also it’s advanced form of gingivitis from lack of care cause I would brush my teeth too hard because I’m always dissociated it’s not noticeable for anyone to see and my gums are healthy and teeth white and clean and you cant see anything wrong with my smile it’s just fucking making me think I’m ugly af now and that was one thing I kinda was proud of (which is vain af I know) sorry
I can’t feel remorse.,19,min48e,10,"
It doesn’t matter how I treat other people, even close ones. I don’t feel guilt. Also it’s not like I go out of way my way to mistreat other people. For instance I didn’t cry or even feel sad when my maternal grandparents died recently, and I was pretty close to them. I even felt annoyed and irritated upon witnessing my mom wail when she received news of her mother’s death over the phone.

I never regret losing friends. I could be your friend for several years and the day we have a fallout you’re simply out of my mind.

Also, I don’t feel remorse even when I rationally know I have misbehaved in a particular situation. If I feel like it and am in the mood, I can reach out to you and try to mend things. But never in my reaching out will I be motivated by guilt, it’s more of a need for things to be convenient again.

Anyone else?"
DAE only feel comfortable and real with one person on this planet?,12,mippb2,2,"i understand what FP means so no need to explain that. 


22f here. so, there is only one person on this planet i ever miss. right when i met him it was different from ANYONE i have ever met. i immediately felt safe and comfortable. with everyone else in my life, friends, parents, family, girlfriends & boyfriends, whenever someone touches me i immediately stiffen up, feel anxious, and get extremely uncomfortable. but not with him, i met him and right away wanted to hold hands, i was mesmerized by his hug. i didnt even feel a little nervous. 



i didnt have any feelings for him initially but then a mutual friend of ours told me that this guy really liked me. so i started to crush on him, and we got together. we broke up exactly one year ago, things have been getting a lot closer again since january. i have always loved this guy. we split because he felt like he needed to focus on himself and think about our relationship more. but now we are back to being lovey dovey and i think we are gonna date again soon. 



we met 5 years ago and i still haven't encountered anyone i even feel remotely similar to. i dont miss anyone else, i dont want to spend time with anyone else, being around other people is tiring. i genuinely dont need friends or family to be satisfied. just whatever he does naturally is perfect for me. 



im not demanding with him or obsessive or needing constant attention. i love how things are and i am so thankful for him. our relationship makes me grow, makes me feel more considerate. makes me feel like i am not crazy and i can get better, i can control my emotions. the thought of having a stable & healthy relationship makes me take a deep breath and discuss solutions. i have grown so much because of our relationship. 


i feel like a complete alien to everyone around me. people just do not understand a word i say. but things with him are just right. i have not ever met anyone else i feel drawn to like him. i am happy with that but im wondering if anyone else thinks is this way? or am i crazy 🥲"

Ghosted my therapist because I wasn't ready to face the music,0,mj2uqo,0,"So I ghosted my therapist at the start of March. Since the start of March, I've been on somewhat of a high. I've been going out with friends, I'm starting my new job soon, but I can feel myself descending into a depressive phase (Yes, I know it sounds like I might be bipolar but I got diagnosed with BPD like three different times). During my last session, my therapist and I made a breakthrough and I just couldn't deal with it. Because I was going into what I call a ""manic phase,"" I thought I was doing better and didn't need therapy anymore (LOL LIES).

Also, I think that after this, all I'm going to do is push people away. They keep hurting me, and eventually I'll hurt them and I'll hurt myself. 
I was with this guy I'm seeing now and we went into an argument and he harshly responded to me ""that's just fucking stupid, what you're saying"", over and over. It broke me.

I had 4 friends block me this past month. I'm having a massive panic attack this morning and I don't know what to do. I need a break from work and life,20,mijj8j,27,"I had 4 friends block me all for different and separate reasons. 

1 of them was random but I hadn't spoken to them in years, but the blocked me after I readded them

2 person block me over politics on Facebook 

3 person was a crush I had at work who accused me of telling people about his secret onlyfans, which wasn't true. 

And 4 which hurts the most was an old friend I had on Facebook who sexted me for a month after his breakup, only to block me yestersay out of nowhere and tell our other friends that I am a narssistic brat. I tried to ask him what I did wrong, but he refuses to speak to me. Our shared friend circle doesnt think I did anything wrong, but feel that our friendship is over due to his own personal issues. 

I find all of this very hurtful still as I am trying to see what I did wrong, but I seriously cannot see what I have done wrong. I have tried to communicate myself to these people but got misunderstood.

I feel like I made out to be this monster. I cannot sleep and I've lost my appetite and I just feel like everyone hates me. I feel so manic this past month too binging and having sex recklessly.

DAE struggle with people treating you like nothing more than an illness?,6,misc47,2,"i have this friend who i have been very close to for a few years. our relationship went from two genuinely good and close friends who talk frequently and enjoy eachother's company, to not talking at all unless they're checking up on me (to ask me ONLY about my mental health) or i reach out to them first (which i have stopped doing because they were incredibly patrionizing). 

this shift in how they treat me started earlier this year with some small instances and odd comments made here and there, but since they just recently started a new relationship it's gotten so much worse. i never expected this from them because they are also mentally ill, and the subject of mental illness is something that has always been so casual and openly talked about among us and our other friends. i've been keeping my distance from them, but it can be hard sometimes because of our mutual friends and group texts that we share. i also just miss being able to talk to my friend and being treated like an actual human being, not someone's problem, obligation, or just an illness. 

this shit is already isolating enough, covid is isolating enough, i can't take people i've put so much of my trust into icing me out too. i've made a few attempts to try to bring our conversations back to how they were, and earlier today i expressed how i've felt after a certai insensitive comment was made (not about me, but another person with bpd) and was straight up ignored. i think what hurts the most though is that they know i struggle A LOT with abandonment issues, and we have bonded over our anxieties about it  in the past, yet they're still treating me like this. 

i guess this is just more than a rant than anything else, but has anyone else experienced this? how did you deal with it? did you confront them? did you leave them?"
Suggestions for how to cope with suicidal thoughts?,7,mipyhw,14,"Multiple times a day, sometimes almost constantly when I'm upset, I think about ending it all. I see a bridge, and need to mentally convince myself not to jump, or I see a knife, and have to convince myself not to hurt myself, not even a bit... Sometimes its almost constant. And when it's a good day, the thoughts are still there... Just pushed to the back of my mind. I do whatever I can to distract myself from them. But on Tuesday my hopes were sort of shattered... My therapist said these thoughts will never go away, and she can't make them go away. She said all I can do is learn to live with them, and push them away. But its so tiring... So incredibly tiring.... Does anyone know of any tricks to make the thoughts actually go away, or not come? Pushing them away just isn't enough...

 For context, I'm 28 now, diagnosed since 18, in bpd treatment therapy for 2 years now. On Cymbalta, zyprexa, and truxal. 

Thank you!

FP just caught me stalking him online I wanna die,0,mj3r0y,0,why do I like him sm... we’ve been in each other’s lives for over 10 years. We’ve had a lot of drama and we started talking again and now idk I had successfully thought I moved one but I decided to give him a chance and now I feel like the same again. I love him sm. But I also hate him. I made a fake account on a dating app to stalk him and he viewed my stuff. I’m so fucking angry he was online at that time. Fucking asshole.... not when he’s getting my hopes up again and making me feel as if it could really happen. I even agreed to go see him again bc he wants sex and I’m so easy and I just want him to like me I want someone to like me I want him to love me. And idk why... bc this person... I should’ve be doing this. I would do anything for him. My heart hurts. He knows I have mental health issues and he keeps talking to me and ofc I love him he was the first person I loved when I was 14. He knows I have stalked behavior. I’m panicking bc I don’t want him to leave me. I couldn’t handle it again. Fuck I wanna die.
how self aware are you,3,miuezk,6,"i’m confused about this aspect of the disorder. my psychologist says i have traits of bpd and the main reason she doesn’t want to diagnose me with it completely is because i’m quite self aware.
i feel like i can notice it when i experience symptoms like splitting. emotions are odd for me because i can only recognise them when they are  extreme enough. 
a lot of these things i couldn’t notice before until i found out i might have bpd and i read more about it. i can relate a lot to quiet bpd more than anything esp because i tend to hurt myself instead of other people when i’m angry or i deny i’m angry at all.
anyway, how does self awareness work with the disorder for you? sorry if this is all stupid it’s3 am"
Is this normal?,5,miqnen,6,"For the past week I've been listening to an audiobook that was set in my FP's hometown. This part made me really happy and I felt the happiest I have in ages listening to it. Then it got to a part where the main character moves away to a different town. This has made me feel awful and I don't feel like listening to it anymore, it almost feels like I'm grieving. I don't know if this is normal and I don't know what I should do."
I'm not sure if this is dissociation,11,milx4c,10,"For the longest time I classified this as a ""normal"" panic attack: when I feel overwhelmed, I don't really notice symptoms ike a rapid heart beat, sweating or shortness of breath. What I'm experiencing is somehow very hard to describe for me, it feels more like my whole body and brain is ""shutting down""? When this happens during a conversation, I become almost completely inresponsive, my vision is blurry, I can't control my facial expressions and I barely move, everything slows down. The worst thing about it is that ""tingly"" or ""vibrating"" sensation all over my body, especially in the back of my head. I've tried to describe that horrific feeling to friends of mine who regularly suffer from panic attacks but nobody seemed to get that part. In general, they describe it as feeling of intense fear or as if they're about to die, while I would say I'm losing touch with reality/shutting down. It often happens when I'm getting critisized or when someone, usually an authority, expresses discontent with my accomplishments. 

When I was looking up dissociation, it was described as ""zoning out"", which I can relate to a lot. The thing that confuses me is that so many people experience that for a couple hours, so I was wondering wheter this could also be labelled as dissociation if it only lasts for about 10 minutes? I'm still numb for hours afterwards, but the physical sensations disappear rather quickly.

DAE know that uncomfortable ""tingly"" physical sensation? Can dissociation feel like that?"
i feel like im stuck in a cycle of self hatred and anger,2,miwj51,3,"it starts like this:

i hate myself so much i refuse to take my meds so that i can purposefully make myself feel worse as a punishment

i end up feeling so bad without my meds that i get angry at myself for punishing myself

this anger makes me hate myself even more so i punish myself even more by refusing to take my meds to maximize the misery i think i deserve

this only fuels the anger so on and so forth

and because this is all self caused i refuse to reach out to anyone cause i did this to myself 

i dont know what to do,,, i dont feel like i deserve anything , my self hatred is so strong and intense partly due to my lack of meds .... feeling so horrible about life"
I'd rather die than work full time,429,mi18iu,83,"Right now I am only working 2 days a week and can barely handle it but in the summer I'm supposed to work full time. I fucking dread it. I hate this fucking shit and it is even worse having to work next to a bitch co-worker. Her in a bad mood and being aggressive makes me feel like shit too. I absorb the energy like a sponge, like wtf. It's fucking hell. Then I'm anxious and shit because of her and about to spiral into a mental breakdown. I can't deal with this shit. I'm so fucking over it"
They/them?,5,mip8dq,4,"Lately I’ve been feeling very disconnected from myself. I’m not sure if it’s the BPD or what, but I feel very....umeshy (no it’s not a word but it feels right) about myself. I’ve been doing some reflecting and I’ve started feeling like I would be more comfortable being referred to as they/them rather than she/her. But I can’t really explain why, which makes me feel like a poser? It just feels much more comfy. Idk. Am I allowed to change my pronouns and even though I’m not totally sure why it feels right? I’m going to sit with it a little bit longer before making any declarations or anything. I’ve talked with my wife about it and she was very supportive."
I finally want to get help in being diagnosed,4,mismj9,2,"I have had terrible mental health since i was about 10 years old, i’ve always known there’s something wrong with me. the more i look into it the more i match the diagnostic criteria for bpd (quiet, in specific) 
Does anybody have any advice on how to get support / diagnosis stories?"
crush or not?,0,miz2a4,0,"so far, i’ve only ever been romantically interested in FPs. FPs are also only close friends. how can i tell if i like someone or if they’re just a close friend+FP? the two have always been connected but i know they are exclusive generally. i had one FP that wasn’t a crush and that was my narcissist dad who (upcoming TW) abandoned me and went to state prison and more. TLDR; i can’t differentiate between platonic and romantic love with FPs. help!"
Relationships are too much work :(,2,miub5a,1,"Started my first relationship in 4 years but it's been so rocky from the start because of my BPD. I made sure he was aware and he's very caring but I'm so hard on him. He gets jealous of his ex so I mentally tap out, I'm there for him sexually but he's busy whenever I need a little help and it flies over his head when I explicitly tell him I'm kinda suffering over something, just switching the conversation. My FP gets it (she doesn't have BPD) and I love her to death but man, I'm so disappointed in myself for this. I don't know how to nicely let him go, he's incredibly nice and sweet but I don't want him to feel like he's walking on eggshells because every little thing ticks me off."
i am So faking it,14,mii00c,3,"God, i don't know why but right now i feel like i faked everything, every memory of feeling bad and all the horrible things I feel seems fake to me. Am I just normal and imagine all of this to make myself special or different? Fuck I'm SO scared that maybe I am faking it, all of it. I don't know what to do, I almost want to hurt myself or do anything just to feel horrible to know I'm not a fraud. this feels so awful, i hate myself"
The little promises that make me feel bad.,8,milewp,3,"I hate how the tiniest thing makes me feel bad. My roommate was leaving for work and made a comment about telling me something later. I said they could tell me the story after work and they said ""that sounds good."" 

I waited up for them to get off work and have just been sitting in the living room waiting for them. Well turns out they went over to a friend's house after work and aren't coming home tonight. I know it's not a big deal and they didn't think anything of it, but even just a little thing like that makes me feel abandoned.

Even just the slightest promise and possiblity that someone might want to spend time with me makes me feel so good. Even worse is my brain kept telling me that they didn't actually want to spend any time with me and with them not coming home it makes me feel like my brain was right. I know I shouldn't think this way but I still feel sad.

It's not even just my roommate, my sister has also made plans for lunch the other day but then forgot. We rescheduled for another day and they forgot about it again. It's hard for me to convince myself that people actually want me around when it seems like they always forget about me."
DAE Have extremely low self esteem?,2,mitna2,0,Like my self esteem is so low that if I do badly in a video game I play I start to self harm and question why I’m even her and put myself down in so many ways and start to think that I’m a failure at life and will never amount to anything. Is this normal for someone with bpd?
i just got diagnosed,4,mimzm4,2,I got diagnosed two days ago and it hurts so fucking bad i knew i always experienced having an “FP” but never expressed it because i didn’t know i had bpd. he left two weeks ago it hurts so fucking bad. i feel like i can’t relate to anyone and my friends have all left me even though i hang out with my friends a lot i feel like they don’t care about me and the loneliness is so fucking painful. all i want is for him to come back and i just keep thinking about all the shit i wanna do to cope with it that’s self destructive. i just feel so fucking alone and i’m worried i’m never gonna be in a good relationship. i turned 18 two months ago and i’m relieved to know what the fuck is wrong with me because it wasn’t something that could just be explained with anxiety and depression but once the initial relief wore off all i feel now is so much fucking shame i’m thinking of all the toxic things i’ve done but i can’t tell if i’m just overexhaggeraring it in my head or if i’m actually a difficult person to be around
Recently got into graduate school and don't know what to do about therapy,2,misz01,5,"I recently got into a fairly exclusive graduate program in my field (sorry to brag) but unfortunately it is located in a different state. This would mean I would have to stop seeing my therapist. I also got into a good but less exciting graduate program (sorry to brag) in my current city, where I could continue seeing my therapist.

I'm really at a loss here, I don't know what to do. I'm not trying to be dramatic or anything, but I really find every part of my life that's not therapy pretty unbearably bad. The idea of losing the one part of my life that is soothing and nice is very distressing. At the same time, a radical change (like a big move) *could* result in my life feeling better, and ultimately I would like for there to be some reason to not kill myself besides ""my therapist would be upset"". On the other hand, it also could result in more spiraling down, this time without the support of someone who I know and trust.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is there any way to choose between feeling held and flourishing? Thanks for any insight."
Numb and disconnected,7,mikfow,1,"Had some big overwhelming emotions the other day. My husband he didn't want to talk about it. Essentially shutting me down. It has to do with our daughter and I know he just wants to not talk about it because it makes him very mad, sad, and frustrated and he wants to ""let it go""  but I need to process it too and I do that by talking through my feelings and perspectives surrounding the issue. Anyway, just left feeling like there's just no room or space for me to have my feelings about it. I hold space for everyone around me to have their emotions but no one seems to have space for me. Now I feel so numb and disconnected. I dobt know why I'm posting this. Thanks for reading. Therapy on Monday. Feel like Ive unplugged from the matrix."
Everybody tells me I’ve lost weight😕,1,mix006,2,Now that they’ve told me I looked at myself in the mirror and saw myself differently I look skinny and frail I was 150lbs and now I’m 138.4lbs I wanted to lose weight again to be 130lbs like I was when I was cheerleading but in that time I was working out not starving myself I don’t even do that on purpose I just forget to eat like my mind doesn’t find it important I don’t know what’s going on maybe it’s because I’m going through so much stress in my life right now either way I’ll try to arrange a new diet.
I am absolutely LIVID with my brother,3,mipjx2,1,"I've been job searching for TWO years and because I don't know anyone in this fucking town I've been rejected for over 50 places. How the fuck am I suppose to get experience if no one hires me?? My brother who has more connections said he would help me however he could. I didn't have much hope until the pandemic hit and he said they NEEDED more coworkers. Even though they didn't have a job application online, who does that?? He promised he would talk to the manager and get back to me as she has an irregular schedule and I couldn't just waltz in to find her. He even gave me hope about getting the job because no one wanted to work there.

Several fucking months later and no answer from him.... we go in to bring him cupcakes for his birthday and who do I see??? HIS GIRLFRIEND IS WORKING THERE NOW. She was only RECENTLY unemployed and unlike me she's not spending pennies at the grocery store. She got a freaking starbucks every day when she wasn't working and she lives with her mother rent free. HE WENT AND GOT HIS BITCH GIRLFRIEND A JOB AND BROKE HIS PROMISE TO ME. I just know her greasy ass threw a tantrum until he helped her out, that's how she gets everything she wants.

I might end up walking the two miles home because my family is stuck in the store oogling over everything. I wish I could slap them but I just stormed out instead. My whole family fucking hates me.

Edit: yay now my nose is bleeding from the stress"
I'm so tired of this,1,miwtdg,0,"I live in poland. I've been all my 23-year-old life and I'm just tired of it. So much is happening right now. We have a really terrible government. Most of the people here are racists, homophobes and pseudo-Catholics. It's like having Trump and his followers around for as long as I can remember. The ruling party cares about no one but itself.

They spend our money on pro-life banners that are everywhere! AT EVERY F\*CKING BUS STOP! They say LGBT + people are just an ideology. Our own president said so. They're trying to impose Catholicism on us, and I'm sick of it. I am so tired of this hypocrisy. I just want this to end.

Having BPD doesn't help with that either. My depressive episodes got worse. I feel empty and numb. How to cope with that?"
I intensely hate myself.,3,mipbir,15,"I really just think I am the worst person. I have 0 self worth. I do reckless shit to feel better or hoping I just die but somehow I always wake up at home.

Idk how to feel better. I feel so stuck, I feel like idk where I am or who I am. I hate the person in the mirror. I hate how I just feel worse and worse everyday."
"My BPD Dad Tried to Groom My Daughter to Hate Me! Anyone else dealing with this, too?",0,miw8u1,16,"I have a 6 year old daughter with a speech delay, so only recently has she begun telling me things that my dad has said to her. 
.
I know people will ask why I ever let my kids be around him, but he has always seemed to be nicer, gentler towards my kids than to anyone else. 
.
.
(I have been in denial about him ""changing"". I have fallen for every single apology from him for 39 years. My mother also always begs me to forgive him and give him another chance.)
.
.
In the last year, he has pushed me to the point of No Contact, but it only lasted for a few months before he showed up at my door.
.
.
My son is 10 and does not fall for my dad's bullshit anymore. He really doesn't care much for him, and my dad who claimed ""he always wanted a grandson"", barely spent any time with him. 
.
.
He tells my daughter that she is his only friend, his best friend. Tells her that Grandma is mean. Mommy is mean just like Grandma. 
.

He does the whole ""Poor Me"" routine, and my little girl falls for it everytime. I am so grateful my eyes are opened now, but my kids still want to have a relationship with him. I don't know what to do.

Have any of you dealt with things like this with your BPD parent?"
I need help,1,miw8rq,2,"Hello guys!
Im really trying to figure out whats happening to me.
I don't know if this is the right place to write this or does it have something with bpd, im sorry if not.
So lately i have been feeling really confused for my pratner and my friends.Its lke im faking that im happy to see them and stuff and i have been really confused about my feelings for my partner which really scares me because i really do love them and i want to be in this relationship but sometimes i feel like i have another person in me who just says that i dont love them anymore and it affected me a lot.Maybe its because i convinced myself so much that they dont want me that i pushed myself away from them but i dont know.Im diagnosed with depression so maybe its from that but i really dont know.I need help because i dont want to lose this person or think about my friends in this way.Pls, any kind of help is welcome.!!"
What would be the best way to break up with someone who has BPD?,5,milbi2,10,"My girlfriend has very severe BPD, along with a long list of other mental conditions such as Autism, Anger Issues, etc. For reasons I won't be going into I really just need to end the relationship at this point but I'm very scared to. She's made it very clear several time that I'm her ""Favorite Person"" which I know is a very specific role someone plays to a person with BPD.

She lives in a very bad place and doesn't really have anyone else to support her, which makes all this a lot more difficult.

She has suicidal tendencies and could break down from very small things, additionally she has made it pretty clear that she might very well kill herself if I'm not there.

Now, none of these things are the reason I want to end it, I knew most of it going in and patience for these things isn't an issue for me. I just REALLY need help to properly do this so she'll be alright."
I hope my dad dies soon,8,mij8or,15,Hes gave me this curse of a mental illness and he refuses to acknowledge he did it. He continues hurting me and i just dont understand anything . Why would he ever do something like this to me?? To his only daughter?? I hate him i hate him i hate him and oh my god. I really do hate him. Hes narcissistic as hell . Hes the devil. He literally ruined my life ! He projects all his pain and issues onto other people and lacks something as simple as self awareness. I know hes sick too but he doesnt have to project it onto me. Im done. I cant love him.
It feels impossible to get diagnosed,7,mij3bu,6,"It’s been around 5 years of my mental health slowly declining. I was diagnosed with anxiety but I just know it’s more than that, it almost feels like they diagnosed me with that because it’s easy and they can just give me drugs and move me along. But I know that it is a wrong diagnosis. My partner was the one who first brought up the idea that maybe it was BPD, we first considered ADHD and as time has gone on and my mental health has changed and declined we decided BPD seemed to fit (this was also after much research across the time period of around 6 months and them watching me change over the last 4 years). I want to go to the doctors but I know I can’t handle the passive aggressive dismissal they always do when I try to talk about it! I’m just mad and want to know how to help myself because if I don’t soon the worst might happen"
I hate it.,16,miflw5,8,I honestly don’t know why I’m writing this post. I just need to express myself to someone who might understand. I feel everything at once and nothing at all at the same time. Right now I’m feeling every emotion possible but I’m also numb. Please tell me I’m not alone. I just am done. I’m so tired! I’m so tired! Please just anyone let me know I’m not alone.
"I'm tempted to tell work I have covid so I won't have to go for a couple weeks, then lie about health stuff and quit. I only started a few days ago.",2,miqmxg,6,"I left a part time job about a week ago after being offered employment full time at a new store. 

At my old job I knew pretty much everything, some regulars recognized me, I got along great with my coworkers. The only issue was I was only being worked about 10 hours a week because of how little hours there were to go around, and the only benefit was an employee discount ( which wasn't even much of a discount when customers could get a coupon for the same amount ).

Then this new job called me and basically hired me on the spot at the interview. I worked a couple days before I started having panic attacks at the thought of even going back. I had a panic attack at work. The people are nice, but the customers there are a whole new breed of asshole and I'm still barely grasping the work after being there almost a week. I hate it and I feel like my mental health took a VERY steep and sudden nose dive. My boyfriend even noticed it.

They're very understaffed right now but they have a few more new people coming in this week but I can't stand the thought of going back. 

This morning I felt SEVERELY nauseous and called out because I was 100% sure i would be throwing up, especially if I went. I had a FULL ON breakdown over decided if I should call out or not and freaked bf out. 

I told my boss I had a fever and was vomiting, he just asked if if been in contact with anyone with covid ( no ) and said to call him if my fever persists. 

Now I'm tempted to call him and say that I was in contact with someone who had it, just so I don't have to work for a week and a half, and then quit in a few days when I'm off the schedule. 

I don't have any belongings there to go back for so I wouldn't need to face anyone.

But i also feel like complete shit. They're nice and understaffed, and it's not their fault I have issues. But this was also my first "" adult "" job with full time and benefits. I don't NEED the benefits right now because I can still be on my parents insurance, but the extra money was nice. 

But I don't think I can mentally handle this without it ending with me harming myself. I don't want to let people down when I'm trying my best to be an adult. It sucks

What do I do ?"
I can’t stand myself when I lose my empathy. But then again at the time I don’t really care because I have no empathy. That scares me.,44,mia01w,10,"Usually I feel like I’m full of compassion and empathy for others. But other times I know I can be so cold, so not understanding. I don’t like that side of me, unless I’m in that moment. In that moment it’s great to be able to cut off the emotion for a second. Ahh forever in constant battles with myself."
DAE feel like their brain WANTS them to be miserable?,169,mi1gbv,25," My borderline manifests itself as constant, uncontrollable, racing intrusive thoughts, that are extremely difficult to manage in day-to-day life. I'm essentially trying to fight a voice in my head telling me I'm worthless 24/7. This intersects with my ADHD in that it takes enormous amounts of effort to concentrate on tasks.   


Sometimes my mind will get stuck on traumatic things that happened months or even years ago, and I'll relive the entire emotional experience of the event as though it were happening now. It feels impossible for me to move on from things that have happened, either things I've done to others or things others have done to me. I feel as though I am defined by these mistakes, as though I can never be worth more than the worst things I've done or the abuse I experienced from others.   


Sometimes my brain will conjure up absurd scenarios of potentially painful situations that would likely never occur. For example, I live in the same town as my ex, and I have a constant fear of seeing him in public. I feel like I have to ""prepare"" myself mentally for that situation in case it actually happens, but it never does. It's just me giving into my anxiety.   


Sometimes I'll get jealous or insecure about things that don't even have anything to do with me, or things that happened years and years ago that don't bear any weight on the present. I'll often wonder if the people my partner has been with before me were more attractive than I am, or if they were better partners to him, or better at sex than me, etc. Even worse, on occasion my brain pictures them being physical while I'm with him and wonder if I measure up to them (I know it's super gross, it's something I try really hard not to give into because it's a very insecure behavior).   


My self-esteem is low because I feel like there is always someone better than me. I have all of this free-floating self-loathing that I attach to different things; I find new weapons to beat myself up with every day. I feel like my bpd WANTS me to hate myself and that I will never be truly secure in who I am. I often read the advice on here and other places that we are the only people that will be with us our whole lives, so we have to treat ourselves with compassion. This makes sense to me, but feels impossible to achieve. It feels as though my borderline thoughts and tendencies cannot be defeated or separated from my conscious mind. Does anyone else experience this?"
Not everyone is gonna get you,12,mig0ts,3,"I think this is so important to remember, honestly more of a note to myself than to others. Living in a cliquey freshman dorm at a work hard party harder college is super overwhelming for me. I recently got in really good shape and am now very good looking, but I am very much not a frat bro kinda guy. I’ve recently started getting a lot of attention because of my looks, but I’m often sensitive and anxious which makes people confused. And also my bpd self simultaneously loves being admired as attractive and also am terrified that people will be disappointed once they get to know me. I can’t really disappear anymore like when I was fatter and unattractive. I’m a topic of conversation whether I want to be or not. Girls are interested and confused by me and guys are competitive with me. Like they don’t understand why I’d be depressed. Like it doesn’t compute with people that I have mental health issues. It’s simultaneously flattering and annoying af. Anyway a lot of people seem confused that I’m not super confident. And I also feel a lot of pressure to hookup with hot girls, like if I don’t get with someone who’s considered equally attractive it means I’m being lazy. Also people found out I cried over my fp and I got shit for that."
I can’t take it anymore,11,migjqs,7,"I am a (F21) and this is my first time on Reddit, I’m crying hysterically so please bare with me and my typing. I hate my condition. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it so bad, my boyfriend left to go get space after a big fight and I’m not sure if he’s coming back, he said he isn’t breaking up with me but I don’t believe him. I’ve changed him as a person, I hate myself. I hate this mental illness, I feel terrible and like a monster. I’m having a huge melt down I feel like I can’t go on anymore, my head won’t stop with questions, reassurance and altogether my moods. I am in therapy, on meds and have a job. I’m so depressed I want to write goodbye notes, I just want to die I feel like I have no one in my life I feel like a terrible person. I my anxiety is so bad I feel like I can’t function, I HATE being borderline. I have it so bad I’m so impulsive, I want to change and I will but I’m so done with everything. I can’t take it Reddit, I need support or something I don’t know anymore. I’m so worthless I can’t even breath, I feel like I’m making no sense and no one understands me. I don’t want to be here anymore, I’m so sick of it. I really need to talk to someone, I can’t. I just want to run away and never come back, I’m so done. This is really me venting but my melt down is so bad I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR I can’t take it anymore, HUGE meltdown while typing this probably ruined relationship for good this time. I want to die, I can’t take it. I hate being borderline."
Horrible dreams every night,2,miplf1,2,"I have dreams every night basically that my boyfriend will cheat on me and then I find the girl and I'll beat her up. I don't think I would do this in real life ever because I know it's not the girl's fault. But anyway, I just want to stop waking up anxious. Does anyone have anything that stops bad dreams? Like any coping skills or tricks? It would be much appreciated. Thank you."
Almost everyone that has ever meant something in my life is gone and I don’t know who I am,1,mittas,1,"I lost my childhood best friend and I left replaying why it was my fault and the shit I did to get to this place and even if I am growing to be a better person it was at the risk of losing her

I have a weird relationship I ended and I feel sad bc he is rlly attached so am I but the last day we saw each other is when he apologized for something real fucked and then left to work and been gone for 2 months and we are going to hang soon next month but fuck it felt :| since and I do forgive him my feelings just fluctuate but I still want him ): and it’s weird
Like I see attraction in others and I felt bad for it and I realized to feel like my sense of self is to create a new one and stay the fuck away from relationships bc the idea of loving someone is something I always craved in life and I only experienced shit but I let the idea of loving someone become a big part of myself and my life that I never been into anything else but wanting love
And this boyfriend I left although not together long taught me what genuine care is and I know he means it when he says he wants to marry me 
And I miss my friends I feel too disconnected from my family to talk to them

I can’t talk to a therapist and let them on because I am enlisting in the military and wanna be a therapist later in life and feel like the truth will fuck me over with being mentally unfit 

I haven’t self harmed in a while but I have rage and the depression is so real and I been fighting it al my life but the rock bottoms never get easier you just manage and fuck I crave help and change"
Toxic relationship,3,mimbzk,4,Anyone else in a super toxic relationship? I go back and forth with how much I hate him and then how much I love him. We’ve broken up and gotten back together like 3 times this  month and it’s just non stop control and jealousy and anger on both ends. I’ve never been this low mentally but I don’t want to leave.
No one ever goes the extra mile for me,21,mid7ob,2,"It feels like I'm constantly putting in 100% to relationships, platonic of otherwise, and people just don't care! I feel like if I only relinquished info about myself when prompted people would just know nothing about me. I feel like I'm constantly bending over backwards for people and they just don't care. I know this is probably just because of my bpd and my tendency to get super passionate and eager in relationships but that doesn't it doesn't hurt. I feel like no one has or ever will love me like I love them"
What is your reaction to someone being upset while you’re in a confrontation with them?,2,mioasy,5,"
I’m wondering what feelings and thoughts you have in this situation and what your outward response/reaction is. Please be honest in answering even if your reaction is along the lines of wanting to hurt or provoke them or blaming them for their feelings. 

Do you consciously notice someone upset in the moment? Does it take being informed afterwards to notice or being away from the heat of the moment? 
Do you consciously think about whether it is “rational” for them to be upset? 
Does it differ whether they are upset in more of a hurt and sad way versus more of an angry/defensive way? 

Does it differ if the confrontation is online/over text, without any way to see their facial expressions or tone of voice? 

For context and reason I’m asking, I am diagnosed BPD and was considering how I personally react in this situation - which is not something I’m necessarily proud of and really  want to work on. I was also thinking about what I see of other people in my life and how they react in this situation, so I’m curious to hear about people’s experiences.

If you’re interested in my personal experience: I usually am aware of the other person being upset when I see it. I don’t tend to predict upset reactions from what I’m saying or doing so I don’t consciously think of intentionally wanting to upset them. If I see that the person is directly upset by something I’ve done, my reaction tends to be very defensive, or if it’s over something self-destructive that I am doing it tends to make me feel a bit detached/dissociate and continue the destructive thing impulsively. If they indicate that they’re upset by something else I tend to focus on that and can sometimes even switch out of being angry and confrontational to being supportive, and usually I also start to feel guilt for harassing them while they are upset by something else. I don’t often find myself in situations where people are upset in a hurt/sad way from something I’ve said or done to upset them but when that does happen I usually initially feel sort of justified in proving them wrong. I find if it’s online/texting I tend to think they are not any more angry or upset than I am so I can be justified in expressing myself in this way to them; unless they explicitly say that I crossed a line, then I’d usually apologise or maybe back off while still a bit defensive. I think for me the defensiveness is what I struggle to let go of, even though I can (usually, except where I think they’re just outright factually incorrect) completely appreciate their viewpoint and apologise after getting past any intense emotions."
BPD and insomnia?,5,mijwwe,4,"Hi all, I’m wondering how many people here also have insomnia? I’ve been reading a lot about how sleep deprivation can lead to psychosis and kind of feel like that’s what is causing my BPD flair up....... lmk what you think"
"Birth control, rage and Abilify",2,mio4r4,4,"For the women on here, what has your experience been like with BPD and hormonal birth control? And for those who have had children, what was pregnancy like?

After spending a significant amount of time on and off of multiple hormonal contraceptives (a game I like to refer to as musical birth control), I’ve realized that hormones just fuck with me. There’s a significant amount of evidence that some even directly compete with medications like lamictal (the mood stabilizer I’ve been on for 5+ years now).

I went from being stable for the past 6 months to unstable and experiencing symptoms again after starting the nuvaring a couple of months ago. I felt a little off kilter but noticed something was really off when I felt enraged for 5 hours last weekend. The episodes have been popping up more and more lately so yesterday I asked my psychiatrist for help.

They prescribed me an as needed dose of Abilify, which I’m optimist about. The rage episodes have only happened a couple of times and I just keep to myself when I’m ramping up and use my DBT skills to try to come back down. They don’t help as much as I’d need them to which is what prompted me to ask for a different solution.

Is pregnancy going to drive me off the deep end? I’m planning on trying to conceive in the next couple of years and am admittedly a bit worried."
Partner's new job giving me a hard time; Advice needed,2,mio1sg,0,"Hi, this is my first time posting here, because I could use some my advice, since my therapist isn't available right now.

So, as the title says, my partner has recently started working at a new full time job. Before, xey used to work part time, which, even if it did sometimes interfere, gave us enough time to talk.
(For context, it's a long distance relationship.)

Now, as you can imagine, she is my FP, meaning I'm extremely emotionally codependent on xem. I was used to talking to xem pretty much all day; He always did a great job of making me know I'm loved and I could tell xey actually enjoy talking to me.
We used to call as much as possible, sleep on call, etc. etc.

Before she started her new job, we did briefly talk about what it'll mean for our relationship; Xey let me know we won't have many chances to talk while xey're at work, and that I should maybe try talking to other people during that time. (Which did trigger a meltdown & a mild split, but I'm more of a quiet Borderliner, so he never really found out; but it was rough)

Now, with her working all day & being too tired to really talk when xey get home, my fear of abandonment has been going absolutely crazy. We keep changing or dropping plans, I don't get as much validation as I would usually need to know xey won't leave me and my meltdowns & relapses have been getting more frequent again, with no one around to really support me.

Thing is, I'm scared of bringing it up, since he clearly is enjoying his new job, and I really don't want to make xem feel bad about it. I'm glad she found such a good job.
I don't want my stupid overthinking brain to ruin it for xem, but it's been slowly killing me and I don't really know what to do.

Sorry for the long post, I hope some of you have advice."
BPD: a never ending rollercoaster,5,miiwy5,1,"TW/NSFW: self-harm, suicide and abuse.


i have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder since the summer of 2020, right after me and my then girlfriend broke up. 

i was devastated when i heard the news, because i never realized why i was hurting my favorite person in the world. at times i would literally idolize her: i'd write her books with how much i loved her, buy her all the things she loved without her wanting it at times and giving her an overload of love. 

but then the splitting would kick in and i'd become the worst person ever to her. i would be so mad and devasted when she would go out with her friends, even though i suggested she should have gone out a little more. she would be so confused as to why i was acting the way i did. even i, back then before knowing anything about BPD, would be so confused. it was like i was trapped in my head where i was looking at someone else hurting her. i would even tell her (when the fighting etcetera was over) that it wasn't ""me"" who was telling her those things.

eventually, at the end of it all she marked me as a manipulator and i was so confused because i didn't get why'd she call me that, when truthfully i never hurt her because i wanted to do so. it was so confusing and it left me even more devastated when it ended. i lost about 10kg in less than two months, because my body refused to take any food. ironically, because when was still in a relationship with her i would constantly eat until i couldn't walk anymore (also a lil good BPD trait: risky behavior). i would tell her i felt suicidal every time and i even tried to end it multiple times. 

everything was always so overwhelming because i felt the emotions at least 10x more than the ""normal"" person would. i would tell the psychologist this behavior followed me since every relationship (both platonic and romantic). i would never be stable with someone without it actually hurting me and the other person. 

BPD is the worst thing ever. sometimes it's impossible to deal with all the things coming with it: drinking alcohol until i'm numb, smoking packs of cigs to feel something, self-harming until i can't feel and so forth. and just when you think it will stop, it won't and everything hits you as hard as the last episode. 

i don't know if i have to thank my mother for this (also diagnosed with BPD and schizophrenia, currently am not living with her) or my father who abandoned me at a young age (fear of abandonment starts kicking in). maybe it was the trauma giving by my caregivers: the hitting, the screaming, wanting me to be perfect at all costs. 

what i do know is that i am an actual survivor and i'm doing the best i can every day. and to all my fellow BPD survivors, if you read this entire thing, thank you. you're so strong too. i love all of you, we can do this <3."
Why do I hate my birthday?,53,mi5pq3,19,"Looking for some insight here. Every year, without fail, my birthday comes arond and I am *downright miserable* for like a week or two. Last year I broke my hand *on* my birthday.

My self-image splits badly all the time anyway, and now there's all this attention on me and obligations to make plans with family. But then it seems like nobody cares at the same time. 

Anyway, I flaired this DAE because I'm curious if anyone else hates their birthday or rock bottoms at a certain time of year (with no specific trauma associated with the date, I guess)"
Does anyone ever cut people off before they can leave them,22,miathg,6,I feel so empty and shallow and disgusting but project my anger on others cause I don’t think it’s fair but I really hate what I did and then I’m too scared to ask for apology as they leave me. I hate being self sabotaging. (Just lost another relationship yay me time to repeat a cycle of torment)
Long phases of completely desocializing,8,mienzr,5,"I have not replied to some of my friends since the start of the year. With others, it’s been a week or two, will probably spiral into months... I’m actually getting lonely, but I feel like everyone who I’ve not replied to for weeks/months probably doesn’t even think of me as their friend anymore. (I always reply when there’s a sense of urgency though, like if something happened. Haven’t had that in a long time though.) So I can motivate myself to finally reply even less...

Can anyone else just not find the energy and motivation to talk to people? I’m kind of in a slump and even when I try to write answers, I can’t think of anything. Nothing makes sense. Not even what to answer to ‘how are you?’."
A constant overwhelming voice in my head.,12,micnsl,3,"I can be happy but still in the back of my head is my voice, ""I just want to die."" 

All the time. And I don't necessarily feel depressed and I definitely don't intend on acting on it, it's just there. Probably about 50 times a day. At least. Probably a lot more."
Is this some form of splitting? PLEASE HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS,1,miot7x,8,"TLDR at the bottom. Sorry for the long post. 

&#x200B;

I had to move back to my home town after university ended and thus lost all my university friends. They were amazing people and we still talk about once a week and I absolutely adore them. They always pushed me to be better and they were the reason I lost 50 pounds and got into shape, I got over my social anxiety, and I graduated at the top of my class.

&#x200B;

My high school life on the other hand was miserable and I hated every single second of it. There was too much drama, I was bullied and called names for being the fattest kid in school every single day, and I just had all these people who lied to each other and fought with each other and then became bffs all in the span of one day. I assumed that was just drama that happens in every high school and just brushed it off. 

&#x200B;

The day I graduated high school I sweared that I would never speak to any single person from here ever again. But due to my hometown being small I kept running into them whenever I was visiting my family. Some of these people acted like they changed after school and I gave them the benefit of doubt and became friends with them. We hung out for like a day every year and texted sometimes. Everything seemed good. 

&#x200B;

But after I moved back home the frequency of our contact became more and more and I realised they are still trapped in that high school drama and their entire life still revolves around high school. They act like best friends but EVERY single one of them bitches or gossips about the other behind their backs. They force me to drink whenever we hang out and threaten to never invite me again if I don't drink with them. They ignore my messages for days on end and only call me or message me when they need a favour or want to use me as their emotional punching bag.

&#x200B;

I am tired of this and I just wanna stop talking to them. Not saying they are bad people, but they are definitely bad for me. A part of me tells me I am just splitting on them and thats why I am seeing them as all bad. I have given it over a year but things seem to get worse. I am afraid that I will have no friends left if I leave them and thats what makes me stay in this toxic and suffocating friendship. Any perspective or advice on what I should do would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Don't have any friends who live close by other than people from high school. They make me feel worthless and I give into all their demands because I am scared to be abandoned. Am I just splitting on them even though for the last one year I have felt they constantly make my life and mental health worse?"
"I still miss my FP every day, over 2 years later",50,mi38i2,8,"The last time I heard from my FP was the beginning of 2019. We had a very toxic up and down relationship, we were both pieces of shit sometimes. I pushed him too far and he left for good. I lost it, I blew up his phone, screamed, cried, hurt myself in protest, checked his location every 5 minutes, did all the things that I now know only made it worse. I had never felt pain like that before. I couldn’t eat or sleep for days. I wanted to die.

I miss him so much. I feel like everything has been grey since he left. I haven’t had a single day that I have felt true joy. I’ve had some days that are decent, some even good. But nothing like before, nothing like when he was still in my life. Most of the time I still idolize him, I feel like my life would be perfect if he came back. But sometimes I hate him, I hope he is miserable, I hope he is alone and has no one, I hope he regrets everything. 

I’m so fucking exhausted. I still measure everything in my life back to the day he left. I still think of him every time I experience anything, and imagine what it would be like if he was still a part of it. I still think about him every single day, no matter how far I try to distance myself. I did everything, blocked number, blocked social media, different state, zero contact. It never ends. I am so fucking tired."
There's so much I wish I had done differently,1,mio8n6,1,"I know borderline makes things feel so much more intense but this love isn't from that. This is real love and I don't have it close to me anymore.

I'm not saying I wish I would have changed myself completely for him. I just wish I would have given more than I took. I wish I would have been more willing to see things from his point of view. I wish  would have loved him the way I was supposed to and not been so caught up in myself. Right now I think I'd given literally anything to have him back. I don't care if it's tomorrow or if it's years from now. I just want him back in my arms. I'm trying so hard to get better for me, but at least a tiny piece of me wants to come out better so I can have him back. I am starting to be happy for me but I miss so much about being with him. I wish I had told him all the things I love about him before I left. All the things I still love about him. I'd follow him to the ends of the earth. I still love him so much. I want it all back. Even the rough days. I want it all back."
Words of congratulations and encouragement.,91,mhyhp4,16,"As someone who is not diagnosed with BPD and who does not meet any of the nine traits associated with the disorder, I would like to share my most sincere congratulations to anyone having to deal with such feelings and thoughts on a daily basis. 

Your courage is truly remarkable. I wish peace and health to each and every one of you. Remember that BPD is only a part of who you are and that it does not represent a complete definition of the person that you are."
Kudos to anyone still pushing forward despite being traumatized and terrorized by their parents...,43,mi3qju,7,"I have never been close to my mother. There is not any age that I remember where I was not fearful of her or felt comfortable around her, and frankly, I am at a point where I don't want her love or approval. She has always been manipulative, emotionally abusive, and sometimes borderline physically abusive. Even though I am an ""adult"" now (I really don't feel like one), I have never been able to escape her because of our financial predicaments and other family matters. I've been able to avoid her toxicity for a few months now, but today she did something completely unfair that made me so angry and stressed me out. I ended up scratching the skin on my thighs to the point of drawing blood and almost started pulling my hair out. I have had these urges before after talking to her but always been able to manage my feelings. Venting here definitely helps. I just feel like crying all the time and I want to disappear. I don't feel comfortable in my own home and I never have before."
"does anyone else ""fantasize"" about traumatic events?",635,mhob70,70,"I often feel like my life hasn't been bad enough to justify having symptoms like this, and when this happens I end up deep in these dark fantasies of horrible things happening to me or people I know with emphasis on their traumatic effect on me. I think this is some sort of desire for people to understand what I'm going through and earn more social permission to be mentally ill.

does anyone else experience this or even have tips for dealing with this?"
does anyone else sort of “force” themselves to split / become careless?,23,mi7eod,14,"today, i saw something that my FP did that made me very upset. so upset i am forcing myself to become careless, but in the process i can sort of “feel” myself splitting. now i am forcing myself to see the person as a piece of shit who doesn’t deserve my time. i am now conflicted. because my brain is telling me something but my heart and my actions are saying otherwise."
I forgot to take my meds and now I'm feeling impulsive and depressed,2,miiw8i,1,"Apparently I needed my meds more than I thought. Because I accidentally missed them today and realized way too late. 

And now I'm feeling impulsive and wanting to dye my hair but I'm indecisive on what to do with it. So I'm trying really hard not to do anything to it. (Except I did a strand test already) 

But the more I try not to do anything to my hair, the closer I feel to fricking crying or wanting to SH. 

what can I do to distract from the impulsive feelings?"
Dear Mom [Letter][Venting],11,miavzy,3,"When I was a little girl, I believed I was living with a monster.

I didn't have any words to speak then. Under the threat of constant volatility at home, I learned to keep to myself. We all did. We were four strangers living in our own dark corners.

At school, I was isolated. Your paranoia and jealousy prevented me from getting close to anyone. Your disapproval was worse.

As I was rarely allowed permission to go outside, I found some semblance of life on my computer. The virtual reality allowed me to detach from my own mind.

I built myself a door behind my eyes so that I could lock all the wrong away. I threw chains on it, and watched it burn. My form of coping was suppression then, until it evolved. I started using knives.

I have picked my skin bloody ever since I was a baby. You were sure it was allergies. 

I cried myself to sleep most nights. You were sure it was just childhood moodiness.  You assured me on occasion, that you could give me something to truly cry about.

 I looked for means of escape. You assumed I was seeking attention, and twisted my words against me. You imbedded the guilt deeply. 

I do not remember you ever smiling.  Why couldn't you see what was happening? The rifts between us took years to form. I know I loved you, even though you hurt me.

&#x200B;

I am an adult now. My own woman. Although, I do not have any sense of a personal identity. I have finally received a name for the mental agony now. Borderline Personality Disorder. I wonder if this was your affliction too.

I know now you were not a monster. You were suffering. Your trauma kept you awake at night, and took your appetite away. The very way you lived was to escape. You were barely functioning. You were lashing out of pain, and because it was what you were taught to do. You never learned how to cope with it all, and it kept adding up. I wish you could have been able to open your mind to treatment. You always said you were a strong woman. Perhaps you were, to your own detriment.

I don't think you ever understood what was happening then.                                                                           I wonder if you were a hostage in your mind and the mother I knew was not you at all.

I can't honestly say I miss you, as you were. I miss the thought of having a mother, though.

I can't honestly say I love you. But I can't feel much at all. I have learned to wear my masks for the necessary occasions. I laugh on que, smile when expected. But I cannot do the same for love.         Inside, there is an ever-growing, twisting knot.

When I look in the mirror, there you are. Your disapproving look gives you away.

In the corners of my bedroom, there you are. The guilt you sowed won't leave me.

When I abuse the person I care for most and send my world spiraling for another time, I feel you with me.

I hated you out of my pain. 

I tried to die, mom. I begged to die. My body didn't, though. Some wounds healed long ago, it's the ones beneath the skin that never did.

&#x200B;

I don't know if you'll ever hear these words before you're gone. Even now, you are the greatest living shadow in my heart. In your presence, I will be reduced to nothing but a dependent child again. Will you ensure a sense of safety with your hugs, then proceed to rip me apart?

I don't know if this is goodbye. But I know I am beginning to let go. I will wash my pain away with years to come of soul-searching and acceptance. I hope that you can still choose to get help."
how do you control your overthinking?,8,micgvm,1,"i overthink so much that my FP is gonna leave me and hates me, i purposely look at his ig followers and snapscore to see if he’s ignoring me/ seeing other girls. and i know i should stop, because i’m enabling my behavior but it makes me SO ANXIOUS if i don’t look. he’s told me multiple times to stop overthinking so much but it’s so hard to. distracting myself doesnt rlly work"
Anyone else feel like after you attempted once... It made it easier to try again?,3,migiul,2,"Before my first attempt, it never crossed my mind to actually go through with it.

I don't know if the trauma did something to me, but I've attempted twice since(extremely unsuccessfully). It took a lot for me to do it the first time, the second and third were over such silly problems... I can't even remember what the reasons were.

Idk. I feel like once you try once, it's takes a lot less to make you try again. Maybe I just accepted that it's something I'd be able to go through with."
How does it feel to have BPD and NPD,0,mitb4a,1,"So I definitely have BPD but not diagnosed, but got the obvious symptoms like extreme fear of abandonment, frequent mood shifts, keep changing the person I am, suicidal thoughts when I feel like I’m getting abandoned or lonely, feels like I’m not one person but like two people. So I’m not asking if I am a borderline because I myself know I’m obviously am one. The only thing that doesn’t fit to me is blaming myself, I don’t blame myself for anything and think it’s pathetic if I did. However, having BPD does feel like hell sometimes and I hate it, I will be talking to my therapist soon about it to get better. 

I sometimes felt like I have NPD as well , maybe because my dad is an obvious narcissist and a close friend of mine is  as well. They talk about themselves all the time, everything they have is the best, they’re the best, engage in risky behaviour and so on. I remember my dad and mom used to fight a lot when I was a kid and my dad left us when I was 10 so maybe that’s where I got BPD from. They both would get really angry, shout and throw things and I remember back then I took it really bad. I still recall the feeling of this intense fear of not knowing if they’ll end up killing each other or something like that. Obviously now that I’m an adult I’d just break the fight up but back then I was just powerless and scared. 

Now I’m not exactly like that, especially when in a low mood I wouldn’t say I’m narcissistic then. I’m usually not hostile to people, and can act humble sometimes. However, when I’m in a happy mood I’m such a different person that even feels like a narcissist. I feel like I can do anything, I’m loud, love compliments, even a bit of a bully, grandiose fantasies, wishing bad on others which makes me feel better, love attention  and love to show off how fearless I am. I honestly wish I was like that all the time. I have been called narcissistic by family members before, for being selfish and not really giving back, but I know I’m not even close to those toxic narcissists that are literally horrible to everyone. I know some people would feel offended being called narcissistic, but I take it as a compliment, I’d much rather be NPD than BPD. I hate having these strong emotions and wish I was a sociopath or something so that I wouldn’t feel this fear of abandonment this bad.

So my question is how do people feel like having both BPD and NPD? Both conditions are in the cluster B but they do also differ a lot so just what to know how the combination feels like."
I have no reason to keep going,2,mihn81,0,"I’ve been going through a really rough time lately and recently did a two week partial hospital program. During this program my outpatient “broke up” with me out of the blue leaving me high and dry. 
Now I’m at a dead end job making shit money and my partner doesn’t understand. I’ve struggled with money because my family has always lived paycheck to paycheck and now that I’m an adult I can’t find a well paying job that I qualify for that doesn’t make me want to die. So now I’m broke, miserable, and feel like my partner doesn’t love me anymore. I don’t see any possible way to make things better as I’ve tried many different jobs over the years and always end in the same conclusion. Things never get any better for any substantial period of time so what’s the fucking point. I just want to be able to live like a normal fucking adult and I can’t even do that."
Every little thing feels like the end of the world,6,mids5v,1,"I'm so exhausted of my heart breaking, my entire world crashing down, and wanting to kill myself over every single small fucking thing that goes wrong in my life.

I just want regular emotions and a regular brain and to not die inside, for months, every time something bad happens to me. 

The idea of a whole lifetime of this shit makes me want to scream."
Why do my friends / FPs keep pretending to enjoy me...? Please stop.,4,midnz2,0,"I know a lot of us have these intrusive, even delusional thoughts that we are secretly hated by all of our friends and even strangers. At least I know I struggle with this.

Well, I’m able to tone it down to constant doubt and uncertainty on whether my friends enjoy my presence. I need a lot of reassurance and enthusiasm from the other person or orherwise a lot of doubt and fear starts to settle in. Vague responses and distance are my biggest enemies.

Has anyone else however had a streak of FPs / close friends that have actually PRETENDED to enjoy you? Ergo, your “delusions” and worries of abandonment were actually completely right?

Now that all of my past relationships were this way, my fears seem reasonable and correct. People love to pretend to care about me then slowly sizzle away, still pretending “to spare my feelings” while I go mad from trying to understand what is going on amidst my cognitive distortions and BPD thinking. I end up absolutely devastated once I realize the months I wasted pouring effort and time on someone who was actively trying to distance themselves. 

Wondering if this is something that has happened to you! Why do I keep meeting these type of dishonest people...? I understand trying to spare my feelings, but this hurts me incredibly much more. I start to doubt every single relationship and my own reality, my sense of judgement. This is why I end up ghosting."
Friend won't talk about how they feel. What is the right approach?,7,mibqls,3,"Sorry, unsure where to ask this question.

My friend with (BPD) seems to have a very tough time with talking about their emotions, or things that are bothering them. I'm not sure if they are upset with me at times, but it really seems like it. When I ask them if they are okay, or if they want to talk about it, they won't really answer me, they just say I don't know. They just won't tell me.

So I just let them know that I'm here for them, and to talk to me when they'd like. Is that going about it the wrong way? I just don't want to seem pushy. 
Should I initiate more conversation with them? Or just leave it as is until they feel like talking?"
Always downplaying my struggles,9,mi9ab1,2,"Whenever I stop to think I’m always like “maybe I’m just dramatic. Maybe it’s not that bad” and then remember my mental illnesses are literally crippling and I can’t perform normal tasks. So why am I even telling myself that as if I forgot I fail everything cus I can’t maintain anything that requires commitment. 

And sometimes I think to myself “maybe I’m just dramatic and can’t like handle everyday life” and I don’t understand why I use this to discredit my struggles because that’s literally what a lot of bpd is, overwhelmingly emotional and not being able to cope with small stressors so of course I can’t handle everyday life??? I don’t understand what I’m saying to myself most of the time. Like what even is this loll it doesn’t make sense."
Human interaction feels like taking a drug,74,mhvwa1,11,"This might sound insane, but since i've started isolating myself I feel like I have had legitimate withdrawal symptoms to not talking to my fp and other friends. I reflect and see that I was on constant highs and lows, no middle ground, either ecstatic to be talking to them or depressed from overthinking the interaction. Those little bursts of happiness feel like I'm taking some drug that makes me crash just minutes later but the high is too good to stop. I felt addicted and couldn't stop myself even though I was in pain.

Now that I'm isolated it's so boring, but I'm content. And it hurts so bad. It hurts realizing that all my pain is really caused by talking to friends because of the overthinking and reactions I have. I have no middle ground, I have to completely take myself out of the picture to be content. It's so lonely, and it hurts being so lonely, and I'm constantly fighting whether I should go back because I miss them or stay away because I'm more mindful and at peace like this."
TIL about BPD and recognized myself immediately,9,mi9snd,0,"I wasn't searching for it.  I actually started to look into it after reading a synopsis of Maniacs.  I recognized myself immediately and I felt such relief.  Just the relief of knowing that what I am has a name.  Relief at the fact that no, there is nothing inherently wrong with me, there is a real reason to all this madness.  I had intense suicidal ideations today.  Instead of taking them a step further I picked up the phone and got on a crisis hotline.  They then referred me to a crisis centre near me and from there I was given the info for a walk in near me so I could get a psychiatrist referral since I do not have a family doctor.  I booked online and got an appointment same day.  Spoke to the doctor and told her that I recognized myself after reading the symptoms of BPD and the experiences of others with BPD. But I needed a referral because I wanted an actual diagnosis. She wholeheartedly agreed.  Both with my belief that I do have BPD and me needing professional help.  She also confirmed that NO ONE wants to be diagnosed with this.  This is seen as one of the worst diagnosis' to have and it is often misdiagnosed. Idgaf.  The relief of having a name to my madness is immense.  It will make looking for help easier as I now know exactly what I need help for.  Immediately signed up for reddit to get involved in this community.  It obviously is not great that I feel as f\*cked up as I do at times but f\*ck at least I know concretely that I am not alone.  Hopefully I can find some comfort here."
DAE ever sometimes feel generally uncomfortable with themselves?,78,mhv4ek,8,"When I say uncomfortable I mean just an intense uneasy feeling with yourself, your life, your bad habits, etc. I get into these moods where I feel down on myself and am very self critical. I start obsessively thinking about all the mistakes or awkward moments from over the years that randomly pop into my mind here and there, start feeling like people hate me or are judging me much like I judge myself. And then I kinda want to disappear"
Family Vacations,1,mijtkd,0,"I don’t think no one wants to enjoy the holidays as much as I do, I deeply have the feeling of hope that I will finally get my dose of catching sunsets and calmness. However, often the opposite happens, specially when I’m around my family so I feel like a fool every single time because the expected feeling is never met. 

I just really really struggle with setting expectations, I set them as low as I can tho, because I know that at some point family drama is going to emerge. I really wonder if I’ll ever be able to spend a normal time with them. The extended family of my mother has a very particular way of triggering all that is wrong inside of everyone. Seriously, how can anyoneeee at all enjoy their time when they can’t stop fighting and at the same time not communicating with each other. It’s not BPD anymore, I realized it’s just not possible for anyone to stay sane at all. (Which by the way, lead to a pretty bad episode, it’s been a while since I didn’t have an emotional crisis of that level) 

So, from now on, I’m keeping myself as far away as I can from them. Isolation time all the way baby."
Horrific episode last night,1,mijctb,0,"One of worst suicidal episodes in a while. Despite years of this, I still don't understand how I can go from having a positive evening to within 10 minutes I'm completely out of control. I don't know what to do anymore. My therapist hasn't texted back, and will probably recommend to check myself in to the hospital. Reached out to new therapist just now but dreading the usual line of questioning followed by recommendation to check myself in to the hospital.

I don't understand what I want from them anyways. I get upset when they take me seriously and want to check me in, I get upset when they don't take me seriously and downplay the situation. Is it too much to take me seriously but not immediately transfer me away?

I'm exhausted from no sleep, scared, ashamed, and really really wishing I had a support circle to help me during these times. I wish I had someone I could trust and feel safe with who understands."
BPD and Pregnancy/Children,7,miabzg,6,"24F borderline here. I’ve always wanted to be a Mum, but I constantly find myself getting overwhelmed thinking about how my mental illness will affect my child/children. 

When I picture the future in my head, I know when I’m having good days I’ll be the most loving caring kind mother ever. And I can’t wait to teach my children to be open about mental health. But then I quickly spiral and start thinking about... how am I going to care for them when I’m having my bad days? We all know that bad days for us are BAD. 

I’m lucky to have such a supportive partner and he will be the most caring beautiful dad ever. But I’m scared and feel almost selfish for bringing children into the world that I may negatively affect for their entire lives because of my illness. 

Thoughts and experiences are welcome."
What do I do when my fear of abandonment becomes real?,6,mi9rl3,6,"My favorite person got mad at me for taking up too much of his time with my sadness and emotions. We’re long distance but usually talk every day. However, he lashed out yesterday and is giving me the silent treatment. I feel awful. My world is spinning. I’ve been crying all day. Support and help would be much appreciated."
Are you dramatic and twist stories just so your moods and behaviour seem acceptable to society? Fuck.,3,mie199,3,"I've always been super dramatic. Every little thing affects my day. The thing is, when something seems like a ""big deal"" to me, others will almost instantly react with ""so, that's not a big deal"" and downplay my feelings which in turn makes me feel invalidated. I start adding things to the real story so it lives up to my dramatic moods, so I don't look like im overreacting. Let me give an example. Lets say I spilled my coffee on the table and it was almost empty. I will say, my coffee was half full, hot and got everywhere. Stupid shit like that. I can't stop myself. Its so stupid and compulsive. Lets now give a real life example. My buddy lost 10,000$ in investments overnight. I told my boyfriend about it, but I said he lost 100,000$. I don't know why, it just came out pf my mouth like that. And now im sticking to it. Then I start believing my own lies and its just a fucking mess. I can honestly not even tell apart which trauma of my past is real and made up anymore."
What to bring to residential treatment?,3,miclbq,3,"I’m going to be going to residential treatment again soon. I can’t remember what I did and didn’t bring last time, as it was over a year ago. 

Any tips on things that are good to bring to residential? I’m trying to think some things through but I’d love to hear others opinions as well. 

Thank you so much."
Weird symptom.,3,midy9z,4,"Hi guys, long time lurker first time poster. 
I’m a 30 y.o male and I was diagnosed with BPD 2 years ago. 
I’ve had this really weird feeling for as long as I remember, it comes and goes and it’s hard to explain but I’ll try my best. 
Not sure if it’s a BPD thing or something else. 

Anyways. I’ll be lying in bed with my eyes closed and sometimes it will feel like the world is contracting and expanding, everything feels smaller somehow, then it will feel massive. It will last for around 10 minutes and then stop, it also sometimes happens when my eyes are open. 
Apologies if this makes no sense, I’ll talk to my doctor about it when I see her next but that’s not for a while, just wondered if anyone else had this feeling or is it just me?"
terrified of returning normality,8,mi8nyx,2,"I’m scared of having to share my FP with the rest of the world now that lockdown is slowly easing. My FP is my boyfriend who I live with and is very understanding, we’ve been in ‘quarantine’ since October, both working full time but spending every free moment intensely in love with each other with no one else around. 
Now we’re able to meet people outside from different households, he’s being invited to go hang out with friends. Though I could tag along I don’t feel like adapting myself to suit people in social situations anymore. Maybe it’s so long going without social interactions, I’ve developed some terrible anxiety in being caught out of ‘not being my authentic self’ or some shit. I think not having a social outlet for bpd sufferers is very damaging, especially when one has progressively made progress. 

Anyway I’ve been having these meltdowns where I’ll scream and cry in the pain of anxiety that makes my skin boil, if it’s even in the realm of possibility that I’ll be left alone without my partner,, or have to share his company with someone potentially ‘unsafe’. I feel fucking selfish and so so guilty, a toxic, crazy human. I wish for once I didn’t have to watch myself ruin everything I have.  Ugh. Codependency amirite."
How to manage jealousy?,0,mim7s2,1,"So one of my FP, I suppose I have multiple. He is now seeing a girl/dating? and it’s made me verrry jealous, and irrationally especially since he was an ex and I have a SO as well. I’m mostly upset cause if feels like alll his attention is gonna go to her, he invites her over to his place every other day and I know it’s irrational. 

He’s even said that if he wanted me for him to break up with her to keep me in his life he basically confirmed he would. I don’t want to do that though, cause I realize that is not healthy to ask and would be so out of line. I just don’t know how to get over this. Every time he mentions he’s busy when I call him at night after work I know it’s because she’s over and they’re up to who knows what, I can’t just hold my anger. I’m not interested in him at all I just am upset about feeling like I’m competing for attention?"
ED+Bpd,13,mi4nro,2,So basically I have both...and whenever I eat lets say an egg and rice cake in the morning and get full I get so upset and wanna starve myself for the rest of the day. And I legit start spiralling and wanna die. I hate it so much.. oh and i constantly feel like ppl are looking at me cuz im fat and making fun of me. Does anyone else always feel like everyone hates them?

dealing with grief? random vent.,2,miekdq,3,"i just have a question. at the end of august 2020 i went through a very traumatic experience that i never processed, and then i lost one of my best friends about a week later (he was in an accident), and then a bunch of fucked up shit happened to me again right after that again and i never felt like i completely grieved or felt his death or any of the other fucked up shit that happened.
-
background: i had a very messed up childhood. i mean messed up to the point where the only way i can remember it is by looking at court documents and pictures and watching videos. sometimes i get random moments where i smell or see something that brings a memory back to me. i can remember certain things but not just the simple day to day life. like i have no idea what i was doing as a kid. i was always just messed up at home and then at school i was quiet and ‘brighter’ than some of the other students. school came easy to me growing up, i do remember that. but i’m almost done with my junior year of highschool now and i started doing really bad my sophomore year. now i’m basically failing because i lack all motivation to do anything. i simply see no point. i know that i am young, but ive always been seeing a therapist or a counselor or talking to CPS and social workers blah blah blah. me and my brothers all have. my mom and my dad are welllllllll something. my youngest brother (let’s call him Jim) got diagnosed with bipolar and ADHD at the age of 5, he is now 13. and my older brother Orion got diagnosed with bipolar and ADD at the age of 7, he is now 23. i am 17 and i haven’t been diagnosed with anything because my mom only cares to worry about my brothers, she sees herself in me and the life she couldn’t have and i often catch her jealous. i love my mom, and it kills me because i constantly try to talk to her and get through to her. i always write stuff and plan to talk to her about how i feel because she ‘feels left out’ but then she forgets. or she forgets about me self harming, or me needing help. yeah. and god. my dad? he was my best friend when i was little and we did everything together. i was always closer to him than i was with my mom, but my brothers were closer to my mom. i always backed him up and defended him because i thought my mom was trying to keep us away but i don’t know what to think anymore. there have been situations that have proven to me that they both lie, but they both tell the truth sometimes. i find myself constantly questioning them and because i question then i question myself and everyone in my life. they taught me to question why and what reason when talking to people, if you understand i’m sorry. it’s frustrating always trying to put people in a box or a file i don’t even know who my dad is anymore though. he’s changed a lot since covid started. everyone has. my parents were both drug users in high school that “fell in love” and became teen parents at the age of 17 with my older brother, never got married.  our situation with my dad was very on and off and confusing. he ditched us the day my mom got home with my little brother from the hospital like are you kidding me? both of my parents are definitely narcissists or borderline or something. they constantly have episodes and i notice it. i thought everything growing up and the way things would happen was normal and the way me and my siblings feel was normal but it isn’t. my siblings and i portray a lot of their qualities and it scares me, same with my moms mom. i love my grandma but boy is she bonkers. after my dad left our lives moved around a lot always living with different people growing up, mostly our grandparents. when we would stay with our mom on the weekends or during the days she had this abusive ass boyfriend i still vividly remember. i still remember his face and i can’t remember a lot of faces. same with his voice. i know none of this really matters but i’m not diagnosed. and there’s a lot more i could say to explain why i believe it’s borderline but ive done my research on many mental illnesses growing up because i realized something was off. i’ve taken a few psychology classes here and there and nothing really seemed right to me. i’m currently in a nursing program as well, because i strongly believe psychology is a field of department i do good with. nothing seemed right until i started to read threads on this sub about a year ago when the lockdown first began. i was feeling really trapped because i was in a relationship with someone that was really confusing and my friends told me he was mentally abusive and manipulative but i never figured out if it was me who was sabotaging the situation because i was afraid or if it was him who really was just mean. i always think back to us having good times though. i began to read about the symptoms that people had to have to be ‘diagnosed’ and i literally started shaking. these symptoms were the same exact things that i had been repeating to all of my therapists, my mom, my dad, my counselors, my friends, my teachers, like fuck anybody. i just needed someone to tell me that what i was experiencing wasn’t normal and that i needed help. i also kept scaring myself because i would see things like oh mentally ill people won’t know if they are mentally ill or will self diagnose themselves, but what if i know i have a problem ? what if i’ve always known something was off? it’s this numbness and empty pit but wide burst of emotions. but if anything happens that even slightly affects me happens, i just shut down now. not physically shut down just mentally. i don’t feel things anymore and it’s scary. i have no idea who i am, and everything just resorts back to me killing myself. it’s like, nothing have a universal solution to appease everything so why not just leave. because i mean, we are here for such a short period of time compared to everything else that will ever exist. but no, unless i am dying i need actual help. my therapist is an idiot who is predictable, makes jokes about my dead friend, and just tells me to believe in god, and no offense i have nothing against any religion but i have respectfully told her that i am not a Christian. this ties in because i don’t think i’ve every truly grieved for my friend. i know i lost him and i know he’s gone but sometimes i still just expect him to like text me or tell me he’s coming up to the summer to visit or pull up with my friends to go to the harbor or something stupid. sometimes i’ll catch myself just feeling his presence and getting overwhelmed and upset. then i’ll just move on from that feeling and be numb. about a week before he passed i was r*ped. he was apart of our friend group and it happened after a party, he was supposed to take me home but instead he took me to his house and took advantage of me. i never knew really what all had happened because i was actually black out drunk. like the entire hour car ride to his house i was in and out asking where he was going and i couldn’t walk, i couldn’t see. we were being stupid smoking and drinking as much as we could, i mean last party of the summer we brought 99 proof bottles and hard liquor. but this guy didn’t have much to drink, he just had his usual few blunts. he was virtually sober compared to me. and to any asshole out there reading this, i said no and i wasn’t wearing a sluttly outfit. so yeah that happened, my friend passed, then some shit happened where my older brother almost died a few times off of a drug overdose, and then he blew up his car a month later. he’s okay now he’s just i don’t know anymore. i see my dad in him, very impulsive and angry. but i could say the same for all of us. i’m sorry for babbling. i don’t know if any of this made sense or if anyone is even gonna read this i just am struggling and i need some kind words and i just needed to get all of this out there somewhere and it feels good. also, feelings are really hard and i haven’t liked anyone since my last relationship, the one that was either ‘abusive’ or self sabotage. i do this thing in relationships where i’m sure most people here can relate, i just ruin them and i push them away. i get mad over the tiniest things that they do and i need like any drop of validation i can get from my SO or even just my friends. i constantly feel annoying or sometimes mean and i always overthink everything i say or do. but i also always question everything everyone else does or says. like why or what can they get out of it. it’s really hard sometimes. it’s like everything in my life is a puzzle. but there’s this guy that i think i might like but hes kind of the same person as me. we are like the same but opposite, his mom isn’t in his life and my dad isn’t in mine. he’s trouble, and im trouble. we are hard on each other but i know we appreciate each other. he makes life a lot easier but he doesn’t really know it. i just don’t want him to become my next FP because i haven’t been like revolving my life around anyone for a long time, not even myself i’ve just been in a sort of numb mode of hibernation since everything happened. i’ve just been living life. i know that once he really gets to know me he won’t like me for who i am, or maybe i won’t like him for who he is and that scares me too. it’s like everything that could happen i think of and i have to process what would be the outcome of it all if that makes sense. i’m just constantly thinking. i’m sorry. goodnight."
I CANT STOP OVERREACTING,3,miejam,1,why do I expect to be showered in love all the time? All my bf told me for my birthday was “Happy birthday” no I love you or anything. To most people it wouldn’t matter but it hurts me so much WHY WHY DO I DESTROY EVERYTHING I LOVE
"“Even on my worst days, there’s always more right than wrong with me.”",15,mi2jy3,2,"Above is a quote from a youtube video. I don’t think the video was about BPD, but the second I heard this quote, something shifted within me. I felt lighter. 

Now, I have it on a post-it note on the wall behind my desk. Whenever I start to feel down about myself, I look at this quote & repeat it like a mantra. It works like a charm everytime, and even causes me to tear up a little from the warmth I feel within myself, instead of the feeling of emptiness that tends to take over when I feel down about my flaws.

I really hope this quote helps at least one other person to feel the way I do whenever I read it :)"
I want to be totally alone for a long time,11,mi3u1u,2,"I'm considering just running into the woods and staying there. If I don't know how to survive then, oh well. Not like being alive is pleasant.

"Life feels like I am drowning and even though I know how to swim, I just don't have the motivation to",13,mi48v7,2,"Don't even know if this makes sense, but I feel like there is so much I want to do and so much that I want to achieve but I can't. 

Every day I feel like I am drowning deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of hating myself and ruining my life one step at a time. I sabotage my health by not working out or by eating too much whenever I see any progress in the mirror. I sabotage my work by being distracted and on my phone or on any social media. I sabotage my friendships and family connections by being completely detached from them and not being interested unless everything is about me. I sabotage my relationships by being way too clingy and demanding attention 24/7 till I scare the person away. 

My head hurts from not sleeping enough but I'd rather scroll through my fucking email than sleep at a reasonable time. I know how the way to save myself from drowning is simply eating better, meditating, sleeping more, listening to others, stop judging myself by how my body looks, working with complete focus, not chasing after romantic relationships and taking them slow.

But here is the problem: I have no motivation to do any if these things. I really want to. But I always get some mental block that keeps making my life more and more miserable. I feel like I should just give up and drown myself completely"
DAE feel like their BPD is just another entity in your brain? Not actually a part of you?,6,mi7vh4,1,"This may make no sense and I only really started coming to this conclusion when I was talking to a friend about it and said ""I feel like I'm in the backseat of a car that just keeps crashing and I'm screaming for them to stop and they just keep going."" That was in reference to how I overshare and catch myself but just. keep. going. 

Now I'm journaling and I have never seen myself talk so mean to myself. I think I actually am just yelling at this BPD entity in my mind. There have always been two voices in my head that are in CONSTANT argument and never shut up and I think once I started journaling, I was just going off on that side of my brain.

Now that I think about it, I do feel like I may actually have a personality. I may actually be an individual who has personality traits that aren't just complaining about BPD and my challenges. But, the BPD entity in my mind is always more powerful. It can never pause for a second and is always ruining my life. I don't know, this post was mostly a word dump but its also here because I need a bit of reassurance that this isn't just me being like... crazy ;-;"

How do u navigate getting drunk/drinking with BPD??,5,mi87vq,17,"Hi guys. This is just a general question. How do you guys find alcohol and BPD mix?? I usually message 
my favourite people and then hate myself and feel annoying after. I also think I binge drink in the sense that whenever I drink, it’s a whole thing and I don’t just drink a little, I drink wayyy too much. Both my doctor and therapist said I shouldn’t drink at all cos it makes me even more impulsive and I say I don’t to them but I do. How does everyone else find drinking with BPD??"
WE CLEAN 30 DAYS OUT HERE 🎉,47,mhtgaq,2,"Trigger warning ⚠️ self harm and suicidal ideation. 

Literally forever, if I felt even a flicker of emotion that was anything but numb I’d think of what I could use to self harm. Anything more than a minor inconvenience to some, had me spiraling out and thinking of ways to end my life. 
After some real intense reflection and a journey I had to walk alone, I haven’t self harmed for the entire month of March. And surprisingly- when I get angry now I can remember to breathe. Healing is tricky and things got messy, I had to take it hour by hour at some points - but I’m here. I’m breathing, even if I really didn’t want to be. 
I really wish I had people irl to share this with but honestly I just want to tell someone.

Guilt,3,mi8zrq,1,"Not having a particularly good week. 

I ran into my ex who is back at his old job, and at first it just startled me, we haven't spoken since I went off on him for dating someone new so quickly and that was.. not pretty.

I had thought ""well whatever bet it ruined his day too"" but then I started thinking about *why* it could ruin his day, which then spiraled into thinking about what a horrible girlfriend I was. 

I just truly hate how awful I was and I wish i could apologize, which I have absolutely not allowed myself to reach out because I don't want to cause him anymore distress.  I've gone and looked at messages where I've profusely apologized for my behavior, then not long later I see a message of complete rage. I know this feeling of remorse, and I know what's right after.

I am fucked. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,102,mhpln0,12,"One second my loneliness is killing me. The next second, I wanna run away from a few people I have because it's too much.

I am oblivious as fuck. Also, I am the master of sarcasm. 

I panic when I stand near a girl. Then I flirt with them. 

I wanna kill myself. Then I give a speech to the audience in my head about my 80yr life. 

I cry over getting fewer fries. And I laughed seeing my fav aunt's dead body. 

I'm always in flight or fight mode. If not I am almost dead and can't get out of bed. 

I crave for love. And when someone wants to be with me, I run away.

"Everything just feels ""different""",28,mhvg45,11,"It's very hard to describe so... Idk, I sometimes just wake up (not that often, like every 1/4 year or something) and everything just feels slightly different... My whole surroundings, the time... Like a ""new age"" just started or something. I know that nothing changed physically but for example my room just doesn't feel like ""my room"" anymore.... I know it's still my room, but it suddenly doesn't give me this sense of safety anymore - atleast not as much as it used to do because it just feels different. Does anyone else know this feeling? Because rn I feel like I'm just insane :/"
I don't know why I'm still alive,11,mi10y8,4,"I'm just venting, its juvenile 

10 years ago I was in graduate school completing my master's and owned my own condo. I was in a relationship (although a terrible one). I had more money than I do now. I was depressed but I felt like I was somebody and had some level of promise. I wish I had killed myself then; it would have meant something then, people would have wondered why. I'm a romantic, I like the idea that in some way my death could have generated some kind of meaning.

Today, I'm diabetic, never finished my degree, and live in a small studio apartment. I've been single for two years, and on sick leave for three. I was humiliated at work because I couldn't hold it all in anymore and was so stressed. This and that happened but now everyone knows my deep dark secrets and laughed in my face about it. Oh and I ended up with some jail time and a criminal record, at least I have my bi-weekly payments to show for it. 

I'm a complete mess and failure now. And I know I can't get better because I know I can't do it on my own and no one will love me in this condition, not for very long anyway. I don't even dare dream about relationships these days, I dream about making enough money so I can see sex workers whenever I want, that seems a more attainable goal. 

Last month someone I was close to stopped talking to me. Every day is hell without her. I'm now completely isolated. I have no one to even talk to, not that I really want to talk to anyone unless I can feel loved somehow. 

I'm not gonna do it. I don't know why I persist in living when everything is so bleak. I don't want to hurt my family and they would feel ashamed if I did it. That's one reason. But it's this hope, this waiting and seeing, the 'you never know's', that really keep alive and I'm sick of it. I'm smart enough to know that my life is highly unlikely to get better. 

And the guilt. I think of things I've done way back in high school and can't sleep at night. Everything is humiliation or a shameful event until I want to peel off my skin. How did I ever sink so low? How did I ever manage to believe I could be better when everyone told me I was supposed to be nothing? 

I feel like I'm in shock most of the time. I'm starting to walk and move slower, my thoughts are just empty. I want to cry but can't or when I do, it's like one burst, and then its stops. There's no release. I want there to be a reason someone should care, but there isn't one. This world is a brutal dark and competitive place and there's no room for weak men like me. 

Literally, the best things in my life right now are cheeseburgers and I still sometimes enjoy watching my hockey team but even that is hard cause so much of my fandom was based on loving my city and I don't have that love anymore. Sounds stupid, I know, but the point is I have no joy anymore. I keeping wanting to say something but I don't know what to say or who to say it to. I really pray that I die in my sleep"

A bad therapist is worse than no therapist. It isn't your fault.,175,mhlvfc,13,"I don't know who needs to hear this.  Last year, when I hit rock bottom, I came here and I had a bad experience with a user when I made the above statement.  I couldn't articulate my reasoning at the time.  I just knew that what I said was right, but I was told that what I said was one of the worst things a pwBPD can hear, and that my saying that prevented someone from getting help.  The individual then invaded my DMs after I deleted my post, and mocked me and laughed at me and called me a piece of shit.

I reported them and it was actioned, but the experience sent me into a spiral of guilt, self pity, depression, and all that fun stuff that comes from this oh so lovely disorder that I'm sure we're all well-versed in.

A year out from that experience, and a lot of self-reflection, and healing, (and learning I was raised by acutely narcissistic parents, and that them abusing me in fact WASN'T my fault), here is what I want to say and I really hope it helps someone out there like me, who went through years of therapy, but found it actually made things worse:

\----

I am of the belief BPD is a direct cause of one's environment (abuse), and also believe it is 100% treatable because of this, if one is able to completely remove themselves from the toxic influence and work on themselves and identify their own toxic behavior.  

It is rare for a person with a healthy upbringing to exhibit cluster B personality traits, so going to a therapist who is not well-versed in narcissistic and invalidating families is going to make you feel like YOU'RE the one causing all the problems.  They will look at the symptoms but not the cause.  They will prescribe meds, try to give you coping 'mindfulness' tips, and tell you why all of your outbursts against your family were inappropriate.  

These are tips that one can use to function in a healthy environment.  When you're in a narcissistic environment, you can try all the mindfulness, meds, and CBT/DBT you want, it won't stop them from abusing you and making you hate yourself.  And because narcissists are so good at projecting a good face to the world, your therapist might even take their side, since you're already been deemed as the 'crazy one' who had to get therapy.  

As long as you are under their influence, no amount of therapy is going to make you feel better.  They WANT you to feel bad so they have control over you, and can feel superior that YOU'RE the one in therapy, and not them.

I remember sitting in countless different therapists' offices, telling them all the horrific abuse my parents did, they would just nod, and write me a prescription for anti-depressants.  They would just assume everything was my depression making everything seem worse than it was.  And I never got better, for decades.  I continued to take abuse, thinking I deserved it, because I convinced myself I was a piece of garbage.  I knew I wasn't a healthy person and I knew I acted poorly in relationships, but I never understood beyond that.

A therapist who doesn't know what narcissistic abuse is like will not connect the dots and understand the source of the problems.  If ANYONE was raised in a narcissistic environment, they would develop signs of a personality disorder as well, just to cope with the constant abuse and neglect that a child has no other way to deal with.

You can finally turn off that auto-play 24/7 recording in your head reminding you that you're a piece of shit.  You can stop feeling bad when you feel like talking to your therapist is like talking to a wall.  BPD is a complicated lock, and you have to find a very specific key tailor made to it in order to get better.

Keep working on yourself.  There is no shame in being abused.  Identify your toxic behaviors, remove abusers, and learn to be ok with yourself and do whatever you can to turn off that auto-recording of your parents/family telling you that you're not good enough."
Trying to form an identity,8,mi2wha,4,"I'm not officially diagnosed with BPD, but have been going to therapy for many years. It was suspected at one point but dropped as a diagnosis just as quickly. I've spent most of my time going in circles around anxiety and depression, oscillating back-and-forth, often times cycling several times a week between feeling good to feeling like I want to die. Sometimes within the space of a day. I just wanted to add this as a disclaimer to try and be respectful to those who have an official diagnosis.

I've also struggled with finding a strong sense of self. With self-esteem. Forming an identity has always felt very arbitrary; depending on who I am around. This became apparent when people close to me over the years have expressed surprise at seeing a ""different side of me"" that they hadn't seen before, but may have come out in a party setting in which they were present, for example. But then I'd be the opposite in another setting or even in the same setting but around different people, and after a while it felt like I was having an identity crisis. I didn't know who I was.

Partly I explain it by an obsession I have with being liked. Growing up I'd have lots of fantasies about how conversations would go, or ought to go, and what I would say. Trying to have the perfect answer for everything. Rehearsing for mundane interactions. Coming up with jokes. And also beating myself up over small mistakes where I may have said the wrong thing, done something embarrassing or whatever.

On the one hand it's helped me network. On the other, it made having lasting, deep, \*real\* friendships with people very difficult, though I manage to still have a few best friends. Anyway, I just wanted to share a bit about my efforts to form a stronger self identity in hopes that it might help another person.

I have found that having a revolving door of interests and obsessions and latching onto them has led me to have a wide variety of interests, and helps me relate to others. It helps me make interesting discussion, at the risk of seeming random or off-topic. But most importantly, I've been trying to extract out the commonalities, comparing and contrasting and synthesizing my eclectic tastes, to try and find more solid ground.

For example. One characteristic I found was pithy. I often enjoy things that are very emotionally evocative, such as music genres like mid-west emo, and specific bands. Through music and other art I can relate to what's being expressed. Sure, maybe I can't relate to it all the time, but I can relate to it now-and-again, and that's enough for me.

Another thing is that I'm a real aesthete. At the expense of kind of being judgmental about appearances, I enjoy beautiful things. It doesn't just have to be beautiful people. It can be music that I think is really beautifully arranged, a work of art, a photograph, real places on our planet, a movie or anime, etc.

I guess my point I'm trying to make is that \*maybe\* you can try extracting some qualities out of your likes or interests that aren't superficial. That is to say, yeah, ""emo music"" might just be a phase for you, or a new artist or author or what have you, but that there is something timeless underlying that thing that is intuitive to you.

In the same sense that your birth-date is an unchanging part of your identity, what helped me is trying to piece together and add more unchanging parts. You have to dig really deep, but it's there. I think this is why Jung's work with the archetypes resonated so well with me. I think this is why I tend to argue from first principles rather than what is expedient. I think this is why I hate hypocrisy, because I've so often felt like a walking contradiction.

I've noticed that a lot of diagnosed BPD individuals seek internal-consistency. All this turbulence and volatility hurts other people, yes, but we're well aware that it hurts us, too. They might not see it or experience it, so they don't know how much we beat ourselves up, and this feeling of doom that we'll always hurt other people, and that we don't deserve love, and that we'll never be better.

So I think trying to establish even just some small nuggets of consistency in our identity can go a long way, in the same way that sticking to a practical daily routine as best you can will help a lot. Or in the same way that it might be better building an internal locus of control, rather than having an entirely external locus of control where we put our whole heart and mind in the hands of a partner, a responsibility far too great to bear. Feel free to share your thoughts on this, or talk about what has helped you in your journey."
DAE have practically have every symptom of BPD except intense anger?,9,mi1rko,9,"So I was diagnosed with BPD 7 months ago and when I hear people without BPD talk about their perceptions of BPD, they talk about someone who is impulsive and has explosive anger. While I’m impulsive, I’ve never had uncontrollable or intense anger. I looked up the 9 criteria for BPD and I have every single one except the intense anger. I was wondering if anyone else could relate."
32 and still cutting,3,mi8mv8,5,"Well, the title says it all... I cut when I was a teenager, and stopped for a very long time. Even got tattoos on my wrists for this very reason. Wouldn't want to tempt myself with destroying a work of art, now would I... but in the past couple of years, BPD has reared it's ugly head again... and now I've been sucked back into the vicious cycle of releasing emotional and mental anguish through physical affirmation, if you will... what a way to live... not really looking for much here... maybe just to know that there are people like me out there..."
"advice from borderline to borderline: people in your life are not obsessing, remembering, or holding grudges against your small mistakes as much as you are. You are doing that to yourself.",896,mha8kz,51,"The biggest moment of growth in my life as a borderline was accepting the fact that neurodivergence/atypicality means I can't fairly apply my own sensitive, obsessive thinking to how others perceive me. I worry about extraordinary circumstances because I am not normal, but most people think completely differently.

Example, when I flub up a word in a conversation, or forget to say sorry 3 times, nobody is going to be thinking about that in an hour. They will be thinking about writing, baseball, food, their car. This is the way most people live their life without splitting or obsession. I had to be taught that. I do not have to punish myself by thinking everybody hates me when my actions are insignificant to them in comparison to how I evaluate myself.

I hope this gives some peace as much as it does for me."

Bad hair impulsive,1,mid76w,1,I was impulse and in my feels and craving change again especially recently and knowing we r still in this pandmeic a 1yr plus later . Sigh it looks so bad and I hope my friend can fix it today and my mom is gonna be mad idk why she get mad about MyOWN hair . The fact I was wearing blue eyeshadow yesterday and she freaked . I also do not feel comfortable going to a hair dresser .
I wish it weren't creepy to reach out to someone who used to be a client/patient at a place I worked.,2,mi9ghk,3,"I was going to ask for perspective on something, but decided against it because I think I know the answer to my question; instead I just want to vent a bit about something that's been making me sad for more than a day, cause it'd be nice to just get it outta my brain.

More than ten years ago I was working in short term mental health treatment facility; at the time I was only aware of my ocd and bipolar 1, but I still found myself being the only of my coworkers without an (irrational/prejudicial) dislike or difficulty with the people who came to us with borderline diagnoses or those who occasionally used self harm as a coping skill, and I always felt a particualr affinity for all of the people there who were desperately asking to be listened to, and met with unhearing, uncaring ears. 

( Since then I've self diagnosed on the borderline front so take that for what you will. This, like nearly everything, is subjective, and I don't intend to get a diagnosis, just based on how I heard ""Professionals"" talk about people with borderline personality disorder)

I've also quit working in mental health and have been trying to do what I can in other ways. Not only was I tired of the stress and bad pay; I felt like most of what I did that seemed to actually help people was made harder or impossible by the oppressive hierarchies, dehumanizing rhetoric, and carceral logic (the list goes on...) Of the institutions I was a part of. 

The relationships you build with people when you're in a position of power over them like that are obviously always one sided, largely involuntary, and shallow; but I did and do still care deeply for so many of the people I had the privilege to meet during their most vulnerable moments, and I tried to honestly and compassionately lighten that load as much as I could. 

Since figuring out that DBT works for some problems I've always had and never solved, and giving myself my aforementioned (admittedly subjective) self diagnosis, 
I keep wishing it were appropriate to reach out to someone who was often a client at the place I worked. But it's just a whole different set of circumstances when you were in a position of power over someone. 

I often wonder how they're doing and hope that they're ok and relatively happy. 
But I'm pretty sure that reaching out even to see how they're doing would be Intrusive, creepy, inappropriate, destabilising, rude, or some other word for not a kind thing to do to someone I only want the best for. 
(it probably is also a violation of professional ethics, but with a few exceptions, those are to protect professionals not the people they're treating)

Also after getting the feel that this is even a creepy ~impulse~ to have, I feel like maybe my boundaries aren't as solid as I like to think they are (around certain stuff). Like, I don't like that I'm over here being all, ""well if I were in their situation I would want me to reach out"" like... projection cause I'm lonely much?

Anyhow. 
Thanks for reading."
DAE not realize how weird their behavior is until afterwards?,78,mho326,2,"Like I’ll do some really weird shit because I’m so caught up in my emotions. Like not even mean or hurtful, just peculiar and awkward or coming off as clingy. It’s just hard because when I am feeling better I have to deal with the consequences of shit I did when I was not regulating my emotions well. So it’s hard to move forward and feel good about myself and my relationships after I do weird stuff. My instinct is to pretend it didn’t happen but that doesn’t actually work well."
Rough Day,1,mid0o3,1,"Hello fellow humans,

Today, I ended a one month relationship. I cried/sobbed uncontrollably for about 4 hours today. Not pretty crying. Not healthy crying. The crying where you get dehydrated, soak your clothing in snot, loose any hope in human connection, life, or the future. The kind of crying that eventually makes you nauseous from crying more than you ate that day. The crying that gives you a sinus headache for hours, if not days afterwards. 

CW: Mention of Suicidal thoughts and Self-Harm

It's the kind of crying and pain that while you're experiencing it, you want to hurl yourself off of a building top, or slash your wrists with an exacto knife.  It is the kind of pain that you keep to yourself because most people would not know what to do with it. It is the kind of emotional dysregulation that makes you wonder if you will ever feel safe, connected, and whole around other human beings. It makes you wonder why such pain is allowed to exist in the universe. The despair of being safe but not feeling it, of being loved but not knowing it. 

I am thankful to say that I did not harm myself and that those thoughts have lessened. It worries me; however, to know how strong, intrusive, and present they were today. It has been about 6 months since they were that strong. Which is a huge personal milestone I am saddened to restart. 

So, I have arrived here, to seek people who might relate with non-judgement-- rather than holding it in until I am hospitalized... 

What helps you in your moments of despair?"

Recently diagnosed and feeling lost,4,mi4akj,3,"I've recently been diagnosed with BPD and I've found it really hard to accept. I feel so confused all the time because I don't know if anything is truly me or my BPD? I feel so out of touch with myself I just feel like I'm lying all the time.

I've bottled everything up until it all came out last month and I ended up in A&E over suicidal thoughts and being blackout drunk. Since this, I don't feel like I can put the lid back on. Like I know I'm going to receive support but I almost don't want it? I've been trying to contain how I feel for so long now that I just feel like I should ruin everything and be reckless.

Are these normal feelings? I'm just tired of being confused and questioning myself all the time.

Thanks for reading :)"
Today’s one of those days where I woke up and realized I had a debilitating mental health disorder,7,mi0asq,2,"I guess the trigger is change. I’m dealing with shame today.

I wish my brain could just fucking act right! Why does it have to be so idiotic? I’m sitting here suffering everyday and I just don’t wanna do it anymore.. 

I’m tired of stealing personality traits from my favorite people/characters. I hate going about life as if it were a movie to cope with my lack of identity/chronic boredom. I’m tired of being hyper sexual only to go through ping pongs of being praise and hated. I’m tired of being the weird girl at work who can’t hold a convo but all the guys want to fuck.

i can't help but to feel like my emotions are absolutely off the charts uncontrollable again and this is going to be hell for a long time. 

fuck."
"I think I figured something out about people wanting to assume anyone who's a pain for ""no reason"" is borderline",1,miaoym,1,"I didn't know what to flair this as so I chose venting, but if there's a better one please let me know.

I was browsing one of the subs that mostly seems to be creative writing at this point, and in it, someone was describing a problematic roommate as someone they ""thought had something wrong mentally, we think borderline"", and I just stopped and thought for a bit. 

See, I'm on the younger side, so I researched mental illnesses as best I could so that when I could start therapy in a safe environment(ie not living with my parents), I could at least try to be helpful and use more descriptive terms as to how I was feeling. Eventually I gave my therapist the list of things I felt, and over the course of a few months she was like ""most likely borderline, however I try to not give a strict diagnosis until I meet in person"", so I'm tentatively bpd(? idk thats a different post). 

However, I did delve into cluster b type personality disorders, and so I learned a bit about histronic, narcissitic, and antisocial(but I think that's the outdated term and I can't remember the right one right now and I gotta get this thought out of my system before I forget)

Well, a good portion of symptoms in the clusters of disorders are similiar, so basically what I'm getting at is that what most people perceive as borderline might actually be histronic. There's a lot more behaviours that fall under histronic than borderline in posts where people are ""they're probably borderline but undiagnosed"". 

Now I'm not trying to use hpd as the ""see, look, bpd isn't bad!"" because honestly anything mentally impairing left untreated is awful. I'm saying this more as ""people need to be educated more period because it's not fair to mislabel someone and use certain illnesses as scapegoats"". 

And yes, immediately jumping to ""this person I don't like is mentally ill"" is a thing that should really be stopped, because yknow, people can just be assholes and that's not an illness, that's just being a piece of shit. 

For me though, I like to actually see if someone is in crisis and needs help, yknow? Like, ""hey, I think you might want to talk to someone, you're exhibiting some behaviours that can actually be changed through therapy and increase your quality of life"". Idk, I mean I'd like it if someone had gently nudged me in the right direction years ago, like my school counselors or whatever they're called should have, but I digress.

Also I know that might not be helpful in some cases because mental health isn't cheap, but offering the olive branch and maybe some free resources to help people ground themselves can make a difference that would be much preferable than doing nothing.

Idk, this was just a thought I had and I wanted to share it somewhere with people that would probably understand. If you read my word vomit, thank you, and I apologize if I offended anyone, it was not my intent. If I did offend, please let me know so maybe I can clairfy my thoughts better, I swear I don't mean to attack anyone with this post."
Can anyone else neatly divide their life into phases of “fight” and phases of “flight” with rare to little memory of anything else?,7,mhxu4o,0,"Once I learned about the idea that all coping strategies, good and bad, are simply “fight or flight” type responses to a perceived threat, I immediately realized that I have basically always been existing one way or the other.

For weeks, sometimes months at a time, I am *on my shit.* All responsibilities, self care and goal oriented pursuits are accomplished, and I am telling everyone around me about how everything is different now, and I’m so much better and happier. It’s never felt sustainable, though, it’s always such a hustle and grind that eventually I wonder how on earth anyone could go on like that on a regular basis. 

Fast forward another month, and I am the exact opposite. Any and all addictive/numbing behaviors become overwhelming and all-consuming. Even in the moment, it feels like running and hiding. Negative, cluttered thinking leads to a cluttered living space and I spiral socially, physically and emotionally. Eventually, I hit a “bottom” and elect to overhaul everything, which leads back to the other side. 

Only in rare occasions can I ever remember not existing one way or the other. Am I doomed to be perpetually amygdala-activated? Is there always going to be something to sprint towards or away from?"

Can anyone else share how your bpd symptoms effect your job and vice versa?,1,mi8vzl,0,"I’ll start. I find it’s really difficult for me to mask my symptoms, especially when I’m extremely angry, like I’ve literally gone to the bathroom to punch myself in the face because I was so mad(which would have been a pretty funny thing to walk in on tbh). It’s also really hard for me to focus when I’m having such intense emotions(and it doesn’t help that I have unmedicated ADHD) and sometimes I feel physically uncomfortable with my emotions because I have no way to let it out appropriately for the work place. Workplace relationships are also really weird, I find myself splitting  pretty badly on my coworkers and blowing up at them and then regretting it immediately. Working has also had a lot of good effects on me too though. I feel like I do a good job a lot of the time. My boss is also very supportive and always tells me that I’m doing good work which is very kind, especially because I have really low self esteem. I’m also a lot of the times so tired at the end of the day that I don’t have the energy to do the self destructive stuff I would do normally. Having a routine keeps me on the wagon in terms of addiction, but I find myself feeling really really empty and I want to quit and move across the country tomorrow and have a more exciting life but I know that is a bad idea because this job is a good opportunity for me and I haven’t even been there a year.

It really bothers me because even when I was completely absorbed with my FP, I STILL made an effort to check in every once in a while. 

I feel torn between blaming myself for letting these friendships burn out and angry at the people I thought were my friends because now I feel like our friendships were one-sided. 

No matter how much I try to validate that they also have shit going on in their lives that I probably don't know about, it still makes me feel very upset and very alone... 

I am afraid to drop these friendships because I don't feel like I won't have any friends left if I do. It's been a long time since I've had to make friends and I feel like I don't know how to anymore. Really stuck and don't know what to do. I'm sorry for rambling. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :/"
Can’t talk to wife anymore.,4,mhxi5l,4,"A few months back, she was seeing another man. She says it was never physical, but was obviously emotional. She justified herself as needing to feel taken care of and told me that I’m her black cloud. This is the 3rd time in our 17 year relationship. 

When I asked her what would have happened hadn’t I found out, she said she didn’t know. This is what hurts the most. This may not have been just a fling.

There was a time I could vent/talk with her about my struggle, but that’s dead now. 

I love her, but am deeply hurt by all of this. My struggles have been going on for years, and it’s taken a toll on her. Bankruptcy, job changes and losses. Financial struggle. I get it. Objectively I’m a raging looser and I always will be.  I’d move out, but don’t have the money and I fear that if I don’t have my kids everyday that I’ll end up taking the big sleep. 

I wish I hadn’t found out and had just let the relationship take its course. She’d replace me with w functional model and I could just slink away. Maybe my kids could learn their stepdad. 

Medication and therapy have helped little. I continue with treatment (3 years now), it just doesn’t work. 

On top of that, my everyday life with BPD. I’m utterly exhausted. We have two wonderful kids that I couldn’t leave, but I just want it all to end. The fight has gone on so long that I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. 

The kids keep things civil for us. They’ve never seen me loose my temper and I do not yell. They are why I’m still alive. 

I’m also working on accepting what I am and am giving myself distance from her (internally) so that the kids don’t know. The shame and self hatred are strong. I don’t even like to leave the house out of embarrassment. All of this doesn’t come from just my wife, there’s plenty of other shit. This one put my abandonment issues on top. One more scar to carry. 

I’ve purposely smashed my hand (bruising only), cut myself, dropped weights on my foot, purposely rolled my ankle, and tried to throw myself down our stairs twice. 

I didn’t make it very far on the steps and only ended up with bruises. Failed again. Story of my fucking life. 

If you’ve read this, I’m sorry to bring you down. It’s funny, nothings changed but writing this felt good. Seems to help me make peace with what I am."
How do I accept being single for so long with no FP and no one who loves me romantically?,8,mhuyrr,4,"
Hey guys. I’ve been struggling lately with a lot of anxiety about my being single. I just can’t stand it anymore. I’m in therapy and I have put a lot of things in place to ward off loneliness and increase my self worth, but I just can’t stand being lonely and alone and single. 

Among the things I do to structure my days are:
- going for a walk
- listening to podcasts 
- reading books
- spending time with my dog 
- taking in the sun
- seeing friends
- started painting 

But I have been single for close to 3 (!!) years and it’s getting to me. I have never even had a hookup since then.

I’ve been on a lot of dates but it never works out. I’m tired of being the only single person in my group of friends. I’m tired of waking up with no one special texting me. I’m tired of the endless matches on tinder where people never reply to me.

Every time I get a match and they don’t reply to me it triggers me into obsessive episodes where I’m self destructive and I end up crying and engaging in suicidal ideation. But I CANT STAND THIS LONELINESS so I never delete the dating apps. Because ultimately the illusion that I might meet someone some day is stronger and more comfortable and reassuring. 
I just want to love someone and be loved back, to be touched, to be intimate with someone, to matter to someone.

Sometimes I want to kill myself because I feel so alone and because it seems so bleak and like no one will ever love me because why would they? Since I’m a big piece of shit 

How do I accept that I might never find anyone special? How do I accept that I might never be someone’s special person?"
Having to go to the ER for psych eval,3,mi0py1,3,"My therapist and best friend are both pushing me to go to the ER for a psych eval. I really do not want to go, I’m afraid. I was in inpatient and residential from October of 2020 to the end of December 2020. I hate the I am now spiraling out of control and my emotions are every where. I was just in a deep two week depression. I do not no what to do..."
Maybe our bad reputation is turning around.,26,mhoyxi,1,"After having some of the absolute worst episodes over the last week wherein I nearly lost both my nonBPD bf AND my job, I decided it was time to start getting serious about getting help and starting DBT. My GP has been unaware of my diagnosis for years now, and has never given up trying to help my suffering any way she could. I reluctantly told her today hoping the horror stories of judgement wouldn’t apply.

She responded FANTASTICALLY! She seemed relieved to finally have a diagnosis that not only made sense, but could now be treated (She suggested DBT). Additionally, she requested FMLA paperwork from my employer to set me up with a 3 week leave for intensive therapy, 4 days per month I can have for therapy sessions or mental health days, and 1/2 days anytime I have an episode. 

I was blown away. It’s such an incredible feeling to have the support you need. She renewed my faith that I will someday control my illness instead of it controlling  me."
problems with obsessing over anyone who shows me any kind of affection.,32,mhnq2a,3,I was recently diagnosed and i’ve found this is a common problem which is kind of good to hear? but i just got out of a “fwb” relationship with a coworker and she recently cut me off and told me not to text her outside of work because she is having mental health problems. any ways you guys get over this feeling? obsessing over an unavailable person?
Brother just got diagnosed - how do i treat you guys best so we can have a non-toxic relationship?,6,mhuybl,4,"i’ve looked at a lot of support forums (i accidentally stumbled upon, you know which one, “for bpd relatives” thinking it was a support group) but they seem to demonize y’all and treat y’all like monsters. both that and the new diagnosis really effed with my mind in the last couple of days  - it both answered so many unsolved conflicts (like i always blamed myself and was confused for how he treated me when splitting), but it also really confused me in terms of how to treat my brother. 

i am currently his favorite person. we get along very well as for now. but i know it won’t last forever and i’m emotionally prepared for when he will eventually split and abuse me for a period of time before he switches back. 

the abusive periods are really difficult to put up with but the best thing i can do is avoid him as much as possible. 

he got diagnosed but refuses treatment for now.

i heard a lot of conflicting advice as to how to treat borderlines. from cutting ties to controlled affection, i’m just confused now so i want to ask you guys who have it. 

how do we non-bpd treat you? how do we treat you when we are the FP? how do we treat you when you split on us? should i accept the love he gives me now or should i keep things semi-distant? 

are there things that make it worse? 

i love my brother and i don’t want to demonize or shun him but i also don’t want to enable him if that’s what i’m doing."
I cant stop stalking him!,1,mi6smz,1,"I dont know what it is.

We have had a falling out due to one of my spectacular outbursts.

But i cant stop obsessing over him.

I cant stop wondering why he hasnt text me even though it was me that never replied to his text this morning.

I cant stop checking if he has been on whatsapp.

I cant stop checking what he is doing on playstation.

Its driving me mad!

I know its reasonable for people in relationships to take a breather if they had a big argument.

I know its not healthy to obsessively online stalk him but i keep doing it!

And then i get upset because hes being all normal and im sat here like a possessed dog.

How the fuck do i stop this!?!?!?!"
My therapist wants me to face something I don't want,1,mi6pv1,3,"I am being exposed to one of my worst triggers ever: accepting that my bf has pretty female friends and being okay with him having them in his life.

Now, this whole thing got messed up to me because the most ""threatening"" one moved to where we live. As I want to keep my relationship she is trying to make me prepared to accept this situation and roll with it.

Since the trigger, I do not have confidence nor peace of mind. I am confidence-wise at my lowest point where I cry or feel sad just by seeing myself in the mirror. This is a huge change because I started to believe that I am attractive after so many reassurances and confidence building.

I feel like I keep blocking my therapist too, and I just cannot face it. My brain tries to run away, hide, dissociate, it has everything to not have to face this issue. I am usually trying very hard and I am super open to confront all my traumas, even if it is super hurtful but this... I have never experienced such resistance. 

&#x200B;

Did you? Do you have any advice? I am so confused. I feel like my recovery just went back to -37928923."
First DBT therapy success!!,2,mi1wle,1,"First time going through the DBT process and I actually feel really good. Looking forward to the future for once and smiling. Love you guys, keep pushing and striving to get better / We can do this :)

Also highly suggest DBT!"
"I would kill for a hug, but I would also kill the person that tries to hug me.",2,mi1mr0,0,"When I was 19 years old I was severely sexually abused many times and since then my life hasn't really been the same.  
I just want someone to randomly hug me. I really want that. But at the same I feel like I would probably just push that person away and punch their face. It feels gross when humans touch my skin.  
It feels like a dirt stain on my skin and I can't wash it off.  
I pull people close and then just literally throw them away.

&#x200B;

Also: I didn't even get any support after reporting that I was raped multiple times by the people I used to live with. Is it cos' I'm male? :( Other people that have been abused or beaten, they get taken care of very well. But they're all women actually.. just confuses me :("
Why won’t it stop?,3,mhyfxf,2,"If I have irrational thoughts, I can usually identify them pretty quickly. I’ll tell myself in my head, *stop. this is not rational and you don’t need to act on this thought. stop thinking about it*. And sometimes I keep thinking of that thing. Sometimes I don’t. But for the majority of the time, I recognize irrationality and try to stop the thoughts there. So why won’t they stop coming? 

Sometimes I hold myself back from acting inappropriately or irrationally. I tell myself in my head that what I’m doing or about to do will have consequences, and nine times out of ten, those consequences will be negative. I’ve been getting better at stopping myself from behaving a certain way and I think that a lot of the time I **do** succeed at this. So why won’t these temptations stop? 

If I am capable of identifying and stopping irrational thoughts or behaviors, why do I keep doing it? Why won’t my brain get the message? Why haven’t I fully adapted to this over time? Why won’t it stop?"
Is it possible to have a fp months after ending the friendship? + Is this splitting?,1,mi63do,0,"I started being friends with this person nearly a year ago and towards the end we got very close (basically in a relationship..?) but i was very distant and uncomfortable with it. Something happened between us (I found out they said some shit about me) and i immediately cut them off and didn’t seem to feel anything towards them, a few weeks later and i started to miss them, kept checking their social media and everything seemed much worse because they’re gone. my view of them switches from “i miss them, i’m sure i can meet up with them again, it will be embarrassing but i can get drunk so it’ll be okay, it’ll be worth it, i want to see them again” to “i hate them. i hate their face, their voice, everything about them annoys me and i don’t want anything to do with them anymore”

I need help navigating multiple fp’s,2,mi10z9,2,"Just to keep it kind of short, have two fp’s, my girlfriend and a close friend. Neither of them know I have bpd because I don’t want to scare either of them away just the thought of that would is literally unbearable but my question is: how do I deal with having an fp that isn’t my romantic partner??? I idolize, seek approval from, and crave affection and attention from my (sadly) platonic fp but I feel like just admitting that is cheating. I get a massive rush of happiness whenever I see her and no matter what kind of day I’m having I just melt. My feelings of dissonance have only grown after I had a weird dream a couple weeks ago where we kissed and I’ve been replaying it over and over in my head. I’m sorry if I’m just rambling I have no idea how to express what I want or need but some advice would be really helpful please"
no grasp of reality and anhedonia,17,mhor35,2,"anyone else feel absolutely nothing? i mean besides emotions related to splitting, i dont feel anything at all. like my first priority in life is attention and feeling loved, everything else doesn't matter to me. i want to care about things like school and my future but i simply don't. there isn't any place in life where i don't feel totally stressed out or nothing at all. nothing creative is satisfying, physical activity is boring. the only thing that provides me any sort of relief are things like sex, food and self harm. i've lost any true interest in improving on any skills or hobbies. it all seems just. not even pointless?? but i don't care enough to try. i dont even mean this in a nihilistic sense but in my mind i genuinely feel like nothing is real and nothing matters to me."
tips for living alone?,2,mi0gta,3,"I'm going to be living alone really soon, and I'm quite scared honestly. 

when I have my bad moods, I force myself to be in my roomates company because I know I won't do anything so self destructive when I'm in their company. but I won't be able to do that anymore.

I'm also worried about my routine and habits, such as eating and sleeping. how do I keep myself eating and drinking regularly, and not just sleeping on the sofa whenever I feel tired. I need to keep up routines but I'm not very good at it. and keeping up with cleaning and laundry.

any tips?"
Just got a job for the first time in a while! advice needed,2,mi01b7,2,"So I haven't worked since 2019, covid played a part in my gap in working but mostly the fact that working has always been very very triggering for me. Not like I have been through something at work and now it triggers me, just like being stuck in the same building for 6-12 hours with multiple expectations and higher ups who expect the best out of me at all times and to know what i'm doing all the time- it's very high stress for me, as i'm sure many of you understand. I normally will work normal for a few months and suppress all of my feelings that aren't ""work appropriate"" (ie anger, depression, anxiety, anxiety attacks, hyperness) until one day one small little thing happens (last time it was literally my boss moved a desk from its normal spot) and i have an episode and get terminated or fired or i quit out of of embarrassment, and then my mental state is so damaged i have to go to an iop or hospital. So all that said, I am super anxious about starting this new job, and am driving myself crazy remembering how painful it was to suppress things all day and how horrible working makes my mental state. I NEED coping skills or things in general that help you get through work if you have a similar experience where work is very triggering. Coping skills I can do in public, affirming statements i can tell myself, helping the time pass shorter- ANYTHING. i want to keep this job for longer than a few months, I want to be normal and do normal 20 year old things lol. Thank you"
Dbt,4,mhva8n,3,"I am super lucky to have gotten to be apart of a DBT program so quickly. But I’m almost halfway through it and I feel like I have been doing bad at it.

Has anyone else felt this way ? I’m in dbt but I feel hopeless and like I haven’t paid enough attention to practicing it and now I’m worried I’ve fucked up"
Insomnia’s a bitch,7,mhs2sd,0,"Does anyone else get hit with random bouts of insomnia? It is one of the things that can undo all my hard work over the course of one night and on top of feeling like I have brain damage from the lack of rest, it makes me really angry whenever I’m struck by it.

Therapist Canceled on the Anniversary of a Tarumatic Event,3,mhwppp,6,"Edit to title: Traumatic Event**

Sooooo I finally got through my emotional wall of protection and asked someone out,4,mht9w0,1,"TW: unrequited feelings, CSA, dissociation 

I really trust them and find them to be an incredible person, we’ve been friends for about 7 months and I could never tell whether they were super encouraging or had a thing for me.

So after hyping myself up for a while and working through some trauma, I finally asked them out. They asked whether our mutual friend could come along, instead of looking like a possessive fool and exclaiming “no! I want to go on a date with you!” and outing myself like that I just said okay. I had a crush on both of them but wasn’t feeling particularly ‘possessive’ or betting on either turning into something. 

Sooo now they’re both together and although I’m happy for them, I’m sad that I put myself out there and these are people I really love, so I can’t hide my shame and just ghost the whole friend group like I usually would. Icing on the cake? The night I found out they were together I had friends over for dinner and most stayed the night (necessary disclaimer - there is no Covid vases actively in my area) and in the morning I came out to them asleep, smiling in each other’s arms. 

And nooooow I’m triggered back to early teenhood of unrequited loves and feeling like a predator that stem from abuse as a child. I just want some goddamn intimacy and this was a person I finally felt like I could feel safe with and be honest to, my last 10 or so years of sexual experience ends with me dissociating and blacking out. I just want the option to have a normal sex/love life already

Obviously I’ve over shared but context felt needed haha"
Does anyone else constantly assume everything is their own fault?,281,mh65zy,34,"Literally any inconvenience or insecure feeling I have, I blame it on myself. Even if I did nothing wrong objectively, I frantically search in my head for something that I may have done. Boyfriend hasn’t answered me in 3 hours? I did something wrong to upset him.

A Mum with BPD ; an introduction,6,mhsywk,6,"First time poster on here,long time user..this is also gonna be random shit that comes into my brain...I need an outlet..

I''m 26,I have a 5yo daughter,and Borderline Personality Disorder has made me a better person.


I was officially diagnosed with BPD at 17. I had my daughter at 20. I had my first ""adult"" manic breakdown when I was 22. 

Some days are miserable,where I wish I could really drive into the telephone pole instead of fantasizing over it. Some days are incredible and I'm thankful I'm alive and feel I have a larger purpose in thioutlet. But everyday,my inner monologs are loud and obnoxious. 


I explain it like this : Imagine your mind as a village. One that you've created from the rubble,one that you've put you're everything and all into..
Now you're on a shore line and you see the water receding,then you look to the horizon and notice the tsunami is growing larger but you can't do anything but watch it gain power. Then within the blink of an eye,the tsunami crashes your village,destroying everything within it's path. That's BPD episodes.  The waves are my bouts of depression,happiness,and anger throughout the day. I roll with those usually well,sometimes I'm caught in the current and choke on some water but most days I can tread and go with the motions. Sometimes,I feel I have to lock the village idiot up or it's going to say ignorant things. Sometimes,the village elder shows her face with her wisdom and poise. 


Cannabis and DBT/Marcia Linehan have saved my life. I'm not a zombie on SSRIs anymore. I can regulate my emotions better. Becoming a mother has given me purpose. Having a meaningful career has given me purpose. Having larger goals and ambitions have helped. But I wouldn't be who I am without BPD. And I'm thankful for that,even when I wish I was ""normal"".

Going through a toxic divorce,2,mhxr6e,2,"
How come there’s not much support or literature for a person with bpd who was married to an avoidant and how the process of divorce makes us face a lot of past trauma and strong feelings of being alone? 

Seems everything is oh you’re divorcing a crazy person with bpd 

But what about what a bpd person goes through?"
I have been violent in the past towards my own parents and I still feel bad about it,2,mhxoop,1,Having been to court pretty much convinced me that I can not lay my hands on anyone to deal with my anger. I learned other coping skills that doesn’t involve laying my hands on people.
NSFW: How can I possibly move on?,8,mhq5av,10,"Hi, I'm new here and I'm broken.
I just ruined my long term relationship with the love of my life because of this condition. The paranoia ruined things. I can't cope with the thoughts and the pain from it. It hurts more than anything I've ever experienced. I'm not new to love, he was just special.
I have agoraphobia and M.E/CFS also. I am restricted to the house because of my anxieties. What future can I possibly have? I'm supposed to be getting DBT but June is the earliest. I think I'm too far gone though. I'm just a burden.
Please don't worry about me. I am safe at the moment. I'm just so lost."
Struggling with affirmations - do they actually work?,1,mi1o5b,1,"My therapist keeps telling me to say affirmations to myself like ""I am fine just the way I am"" & whatnot but despite months of being told to do this, I still struggle with actually doing it. I feel like affirmations are trite & don't actually make a difference, & I'm afraid of gaslighting myself into thinking I have fixed things when really I am just lying to myself. I used to be super into the personal development community & gaslit myself into thinking I wasn't mentally ill so I could fit in with the group & be ""high level"" but that really ended up backfiring so the idea of affirmations still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I'm a self-aware person with BPD & logically know in tough situations that what I am feeling might not be true but trying to say affirmations to myself when stuff like that happens seems useless & trite, not to mention I often forget to say it. 

I don't know if being neurodivergent, with ADHD & likely autism according to my therapist, has anything to do with WHY affirmations seem so much harder for me than my therapist thinks they should be. I am good at WRITING words but less eloquent about knowing what to say when speaking, & I am a visual & experience learner, not an auditory learner so maybe I'm just not connecting with words specifically? Does anyone have a workaround for this? I've tried explaining my difficulties with this to my therapist but I don't think I explained it well, & it's super frustrating for me to try doing something but not being able to make it work yet, despite MONTHS of trying."
Life on a roller coaster is getting to me,7,mhplzn,1,"I still haven’t accepted the full scale of impact that this has on me day-to-day. Because I minimize it, it finds new ways to affect me.  

In some ways I’m doing well right now. I can keep my emotions better controlled than I used to, which is nice. I have not self harmed in a while despite the impulse. I’m proud of myself for both these things and should probably give myself more credit. 

Other stuff I’m not handling as well. I’m not splitting when it comes to *other people,* which is good, but I’m splitting when it comes to myself and almost everything else. My paranoia has been bad. Particularly about my job. Last week I felt like I was on the verge of getting promoted. This week I’m convinced that I’m the weak link on staff. 

I just wish I could have control of my own worldview. That I didn’t have to live every day at the will of extremes. No wonder why I’m always  exhausted. 

I don’t talk openly about how my BPD makes me feel... ever... but it’s weighing on me tonight and I needed to put the words out there. Hopefully it’s a state of mind I can sleep off by morning."
How do you experience black and white thinking?,9,mhoar8,7,"Hi everyone. I am 19 years old and my therapist and I recently discussed that I show many traits of BPD (more than the “required” amount of symptoms to be diagnosed) though she is hesitant to officially diagnose due to the stigma with personality disorders. However, for the “black and white thinking” trait, I asked her for more clarification and she told me she did not know an answer. So, I figured it would be better to ask others that actually experience this, as that is what my question(s) pertain to. I definitely switch between idolizing and demonizing people mentally, though I was wondering if it mattered if this switch between the two was caused by something or if it was somewhat random. For me, it seems to either be random, or they will do something (that is objectively not a very big deal and does not warrant it) and I will assume that they hate me, they’re trying to use me, they’re out to get me, they want to leave me, etc. I just wanted to hear some thoughts on this. Thanks everyone."
I don’t wanna leave my house ever again,20,mhjhij,2,"I love living alone, with my cat. I’d be so happy if I never had to leave again. Only a few select people would come over.

Feeling very emotionally detached right now,4,mhrbxv,2,"Specifically around suicide and valuing my own life. There are so many other people in the world that could easily fill any of the roles I play in other peoples' lives. Why should it matter if it's specifically me that's around? Why are people so opposed to me killing myself? Why can't I just be euthanized?

When I ask these questions at the moment I feel very matter of fact. Very emotionless towards it all and not at all distressed or anything. It's so different from my usual wild mood swings, but also welcome. 

I know that if someone close to me were to die, from suicide or otherwise, that I'd feel very strongly about the situation. But right now I can't imagine why someone would feel the same for me. It almost seems silly? I'm very replaceable.

Idk. Felt like sharing and am curious if anyone else gets these thoughts."
I’ve officially made it a week without self harm.,64,mhbxpa,15,"The last time I self harmed resulted in a pretty severe burn, which has barely healed. After than I knew I had to stop.

I don't ever send him photos of myself because he doesn't ever compliment them he rarely tells me im beautiful or anything like that he doesn't do words of affirmation but sometimes my bpd brain needs them to feel secure

Trying to choose a DBT workbook to start but there are so many!,1,mhycg9,2,"I know that I need help. The last two years have been the hardest of my life and I’m spiraling.

I have a very hard time with medical professionals because I was injured pretty badly from my ob/gyn making a dumb call that cost me about a decade of pain. Plus, ya know, I’m a naturally paranoid person apparently. So I thought I would get a workbook or two to ease myself into it. But I cannot choose. They either seem too good to be true or like they could do more harm than good. Or maybe I’m just being too picky. 

So I’ll ask y’all. Have you done any of these workbooks on your own? Which did you do and did it help or hurt you? 

I know therapy is my best option. But I have so much anxiety and anger when I think about going that I have to self soothe or I’ll have an anxiety attack. I’m trying my best."
Abilify... Manic?,1,mhxrcr,3,"Backstory.

Back in august, I had a trigger with a ptsd rape issue I never addressed 15 yes ago.. I completely split in my head and cut off my feelings with my fiance. Met someone who became my favorite person. 

When they decided to stop talking to me 6 weeks later... I full on went, what I thought, hypomanic.  I was so hypersexual, talking to like 30 guys, taking naked pics, cheating on my fiance who I felt broken up with but he didn't know my feelings changed at all. Cheated on him. 

Now we're working things out and my therapist and psychiatrist think it was all ptsd triggered. I had a hard time regulating my emotions, from happy to blank, sudden rages. 


TLTR
 I'm on abilify now (only 2mg) for about a week and today I suddenly spent 100 dollars on easter toys and stuff for my son. Aka crap toys. 
I want to jump up and down and laugh.. I'm skipping around my house and playing around with my cats...

It scares me how easily I can cut people off completely…,45,mhcq8v,28,"Has anyone here found any way to minimize this impulse/act?

I just got diagnosed with BPD,4,mhouct,2,"An hour ago I got diagnosed with BPD, I don’t know how to feel about it. My friends are supportive, my family are treating it like I’m possessed or smth, as if they talk about it, they’ll get it too. I know BPD is really taboo and stigmatised so I’m worried what others will think."
Never enough. Not for me. Not for anyone.,6,mhnz7y,3,"I don't feel like it will ever be. If it is, it will take every part of my being to do so. I tried to reach out and to be understood and as many times as I've tried to explain and simplify it. It isn't enough. I won't ever have real friends. I won't ever be able to feel I'm fully embodied. The best I can hope for is that atleast I understand others. I understand them, I help them, and I am their catalyst for their growth. Is anyone my catalyst? Is anyone my friend? Nah. .

I know well enough I'm only here to be here for others. I'm main character or anyone important. I exist for others. I am unknown and alone. I'm only some weird foundation for others to build their empire or self on. I wasn't meant to be cared for or acknowledged."

When should I tell the new guy I’m dating about my BPD?,6,mhnk3a,7,"  I was recently diagnosed last year with BPD. It has definitely been the root of many of my issues with my past relationships. I feel more at peace being able to assign a name and reason as to why I have acted the way I have to my partners in the past.
  
  I just got out of a seven year relationship about four months ago and am ready to get back on to the so-called dating horse. Since I’ve been in a relationship for so long and because of my new diagnoses, getting to know and dating people does not come naturally for me. 

  Fortunately, I managed to meet this amazing guy from Tinder. It’s only been a few weeks but he definitely seems stable with a great family. He’s incredibly open minded and honest (borderlining an over-sharer, but I kind of like that as I can be the same way). I have a lot of respect for him and I really want this relationship to be stable and last a while. I want to be honest with him about my BPD but I’m unsure when a good time is or how long I should wait to tell him.

  If anyone can also provide some info about dating with bpd, that would also be much appreciated :)"
Wish I could be someone,5,mho0lg,0,"I just wish I could be someone instead of being everyone and no one. Is any1 else barely able to keep it together? i want to end it so badly. how do you guys cope? I find nothing interesting anymore, if I do it’s very shallow and temporary. No one to talk to anymore because everyone left me, even people I thought were like me and  would be with me forever. I’m sick of the struggling, I tried so hard."
"DAE pick their lips to the point that they are raw and bleeding? CW: Blood, lip-picking",13,mhj8lx,13,"I know lip-picking is a really common problem, but I was wondering if there is a significant link between BPD and lip-picking or if it's just a habit or a symptom linked to something else.

I've struggled with horrible lip-picking for about 7 years. I just can't help myself. I pick and bite at my lips until they are raw, bleeding profusely, scabbed over and peeling constantly. My fingertips and nails are always covered in blood from just how much I pick my lips. I pick them so badly that blood drips down my chin, covers my whole lips, pools in the corners of my mouth, etc. 

It's getting worse and worse and I'm always embarrassed by how it makes me look and feel really ashamed whenever somebody points out the state of my lips. It's also to the point where my teeth ache all the time because I clench my jaw so hard in order to really rip at the skin on my lips, so now my teeth are sore from the pressure I'm putting on them when I pick my lips. 

It's something I do almost without thinking - I'll be completely checked out staring into nothing but when I come back to myself, I catch myself picking at my lips. It's even to the point where I'm wasting time just sitting and compulsively picking at my lips. I'll be trying to get an assignment done but will spend half an hour picking at my lips unable to force myself myself to start doing something else. 

Is it possible that lip-picking has an association with BPD, or is there a completely different link there? It's a horrible, destructive habit of mine and I wish I could stop but I just can't do it."
DAE have any vices the use to cope with the suffering?,4,mhpkk5,1,"As we all know this disorder is a pain in the ass to deal with everyday. Try as I might to apply the healthy life skills to cope with this awful disorder when my symptoms get severe I resort to my unhealthy vices.

am i overreacting for wanting to break up with my boyfriend cause hes a bad texter,3,mhpfch,3,"I’ve (19F )been with my boyfriend (21M) for about 9 months now and Im getting so frustrated to the point where i just want to end things with him. 

On almost a daily basis i will text him and he takes like hours to respond and i get it if youre busy or got distracted its fine that happens to everyone but this happens almost every fucking day and on top of that while my texts go unnoticed ill see him on instagram and twitter too. Ive talked to him about this multiple times and he says its cause hes not on his phone that much, gets busy, his adhd etc and thats fair not everyone is a good texter or likes texting but when were together every 5 minutes or when theres a moment of silence he goes straight to his phone. hes always on his phone when we hang out and he doesnt make an effort to start conversation with me unless i initiate it. sometimes he’ll ask me how im feeling or he will just ask if im horny and want to have sex. Its annoying because im always asking what he wants to do, or initiating a conversation, finding something to watch. I also told him like if texting isnt your thing we can call each other during the week and stuff. and of course im the only one who calls/offers to call. Like it hurts because it feels like he doesnt give a shit when were together and when were apart 

im so fucking annoyed because ive brought this up to him a few times before and its making me angry cause i dont wanna constantly nag about this i feel like i should just leave the relationship because it makes me so upset. 

i try to look at the positives of our relationship and i do love him but im starting to realize he does the bare minimum and im tired of asking him to put in more effort. 

maybe im overreacting and being too harsh especially since he has his own issues and its common for ppl with adhd to have poor communication skills but holy fuck i bave adhd too on top of my bpd and ive been trying so hard with this relationship to properly communicate my feelings and not blow up on him and work on my toxic shit and ive been doing good. 

But i also dont want to keep having the same conversation with him and there be no change. I dont want to be in a one sided relationship. 

has anyone else been in a similar situation and can give me advice on what to do i feel so stuck and irrational"
experience with antidepressants and BPD,9,mhkf8q,9,"ive been struggling with depression on and off since i was a child, but within the past two years i’ve been struggling a lot with managing my symptoms. I barely got diagnosed with BPD last summer and although DBT helped a lot, i can’t remember what its like to be happy anymore. i feel like no matter what i try to change in my life im still filled with sadness and self hate and everything feels so exhausting. I brought this up to my psychiatrist and she told me that i could consider antidepressants if my symptoms got worse. I am starting to think that i will always feel this empty so maybe i should try it. I am just so scared of the effects. one of the main reasons i am avoiding it is because i already struggle with my weight, and my sex drive is really important to me and i heard that it affects these aspects the most. how has antidepressants impact you? should i give it a chance even with my concerns? or should i just push through for now"
Is it possible to have a healthy relationship with someone who has NPD traits?,10,mhjjxu,5,"I recently came to the realization that my boyfriend has Narc traits, it's not severe but it is noticeable. He lovebombed me in the beginning of our relationship when he first met me BIG time and has a tendency to react very badly to any criticism. Often times when he messes up and I point it out, he will flip it around on me to make it seem like I am the source of every issue and then I end up crying and apologizing even though he's the one who wronged me. 

With that being said, we actually had a really good, open discussion about this last night. I told him I thought he had these traits and pointed out the similarities. I told him I was not trying to diagnose him but just saying that he for sure has some of these traits and it is an issue he needs to work on. He cried and told me that he always felt like something was wrong, his own need for admiration and validation, he thanked me for bringing it to hisnattention and promised that he would really try to be aware of this and work on it. 

So my question is this: 

Is it possible to have a successful relationship as someone who is BPD with somebody who has narc tendencies? Or is this combination too explosive and bound to fail? 

I really love him and I think the fact that we are both self aware gives us an advantage, but I could really use some outside perspective."
I can’t handle being around people because I feel worthless,1,mhu0ep,3,"I’m not sure what I will title this

I’m just feeling intense pain and I’m wondering if anybody else here feels this way.

I have feelings of intense dislike and self loathing. I don’t like almost anything about myself, and hide myself away because if I see anybody who looks prettier than me, I feel so much pain.

I see the way that they are happy. People at the same age who are able to keep friends and to live a normal life. I feel like an empty shell, unable to feel or do the things that I want to. 

In those moments where I can’t hide myself away, I realise why I had to drop out of school and employment when my feelings of self loathing were triggered. When I would avoid and run from it, but even being in a public space I can’t.

It hurts being this way. I acknowledge my feelings and reassure myself who I am and why my appearance is different from others and that I am still loveable and have worth, even if I might not see it right now. 
But it comes crashing down when I realise that I’m a dislikable person and I feel helplessness and despair that I have to face these problems.

I know in part a lot of this is imaginary and even if things were going on, I still deserve to love my life and have positive self image.

I can’t find it in me to feel okay with myself, to not feel negative about everything in my life. 
I’m feeling so worthless that words can’t even describe it."
Is anybody else helped by venting but find that nobody wants to let them do it?,9,mhikwo,9,"I've had a whole bunch of therapists and was not helped by them or they even made me worse but I find peer support really helpful when somebody will just listen to me during a meltdown and make me feel heard and understood. When I can calm down I can go back to being rational and using strategies and healthy thinking and all that. But that's so damn hard to get. And I'm actively punished for seeking it. I've had a lot of bad experiences where people got mad at me for doing this or just stopped responding to my messages. I've been called self-centered and overly negative. It was traumatizing and it's happened so many times that at this point I'm afraid to engage with people unless I feel well enough to put up a fake, happy facade. When I'm too upset to act like that I just avoid people entirely because I'm so afraid that they'll get mad and reinforce that mental schema that I'm too flawed for anybody to ever like or want to talk to. And it also adds to the mental schema that nobody will ever like me unless I somehow start liking and benefitting from therapists. And that no matter what I do for myself, no matter how much I self educate, no matter how hard I try, no matter how well I get to know myself and what helps me, nobody sees that or cares. Just blanket condemnation because if I don't want to go to therapy then I must be an intellectually disabled toddler that just doesn't care. 

It's gotten so bad that I'll stop talking to a person the second it looks like they might be annoyed. But I've been trying to challenge the above by actually giving people a chance to reject me and believing them when they say it's okay to vent instead of doing it once, freaking out like ""oh god I made a mortal mistake"" and then being too scared to ever talk to that person again. But so far I've been unlucky in that people either find me exhausting or simply aren't responsive and I don't feel heard at all and just get more upset.

I hate the whole culture of ""a therapist or else"" and ""self-help and peer support are worthless and stupid"" and am tired of having ""get yet another therapist"" shoved down my throat. And how people act like I don't know anything about my mind even though I did most of a psychology degree, have had tons of therapy, have read tons of self help books, practice healthy habits every day... it's like they think I'm too stupid to have learned a dang thing. It's like they think I'm too dumb to know what works for me and that without a therapist I don't even know when I need to take a shit.

I hate being put in the same league as people who have absolutely no self-insight, have never done therapy, have never read a self help book, have never tried implementing a strategy, have never tried exercising or eating healthy... and treating me like I'm exactly the same. It's like everything I've done to get better and the improvements I've made are invisible and no one cares. Just because my approach is different. No other reason. I hate it."
"Feeling really upset that therapist suggested I may have BPD, Narc Fleas, or some BPD traits",0,mhxz9o,3,"Anyone else get really upset when therapist told them they have fleas?

My new personal therapist, who I haven’t known for very long said my FMIL is exhibiting Narc behavior based on what I told her. 

(My old therapist who I saw for 6 years for trauma after having a serious illness / my family distinction passed away unexpectedly about 6 months ago) 

My own mom is an NMom. I have very limited contact with her. 

Our couples therapist who we have been working with for about 1.5 years asked if my old therapist ever gave me any specific diagnosis and I said no because I wasn’t aware of one. She then said it’s not uncommon for NMom children to have BPD, but she said she wasn’t diagnosing me with BPD or implying I had it. 

She didn’t use the term fleas, but she said I may be imprinting Narc behavior on my FMIL because I have my own work to do that I wasn’t able to resolve with my own parents who she said likely both have a personality disorder. 

I felt like she was saying I may have fleas and it totally brought me down to my knees. I have spent most of last night and this morning crying. Fleas or possible personality disorder are my worst fear so I’ve been feeling really sad and angry that she asked me if my last therapist gave me any sort of diagnosis. Anyone else have this experience? 

Obviously want to get better if I do have fleas and will go to a different community if I do have a personality disorder, but nonetheless has really rocked my world. My partner agrees with couples therapist."
No wonder I am who I am,42,mh8ied,12,"My mom is a manipulative bitch. I always kinda knew that. We fought a lot when I was younger because she would let all her frustration out on me. I live with my boyfriend most of the time to avoid her, but every now and then I visit my parents. Well today she yelled at me because I literally couldn’t read her mind. She wanted me to get something from the pharmacy without telling me. She said I could have known. I even offered to get it anyway, even tho she just yelled at me and then walked away. But of course she didn’t take that offer because then she couldn’t have called me a selfish bitch without any empathy for other people (yeah right, me, who is about to work in the mental health field because I do care). Anyway she continued to tell me how awful I am for a few minutes. I usually would have snapped in no time but I just stayed calm and said that I won’t argue with her about a misunderstanding. As expected this made her even more furious but I didn’t care. I really felt the urge to selfharm, but I didn’t. I think it was the first time I thought to myself ”I’m better than this. I don’t deserve this“. So I guess this is a small triumph for me. I have never seen the reason for my mental illness so clearly it was almost like a wake up call.
Anyway, thanks for reading. I love you guys. Keep fighting!❤️✨"
I’m all alone in love with someone that probably doesn’t love me back,10,mhhfw4,3,This kills me. I don’t want to deal with life anymore because of it. It makes me feel like this will keep happening.
Any advice on having to live with your toxic parents?,4,mhlrx1,2,"Hi borderline friends :)

With the nature of the pandemic, I am still paying for and actively attending college (virtually and thousands of miles away lol) totally out of a job, broke and living with my parents. These people who “raised” me are making me crazy and I hate living here. My dad is verbally aggressive and quite honestly, getting to be just a grumpy old man. My mom, who has never been the type to create or keep boundaries, is a borderline narcissist and uses me for emotional support, or at least tries to. 

Considering the fact that I think I’ll need about another year to get back on my feet, does anyone have any tips on trying to heal in the environment where you were traumatized? Is that even possible? Any ideas for how to put up firm boundaries and self-preserve as much as I can? Thanks for any suggestions/advice! <333"
Treating Self-Injury through Research Study,6,mhlonx,1,"Thank you to the moderators of r/BPD for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

My girlfriend has BPD and nothing is getting better,3,mho28l,16,"We are long distance, she has had it for a long time, I do not have BPD however I have to suffer the effects of it through her. She goes to a therapist but does not receive treatment, she doesn't tell her therapist anything and I am the only person that knows all the full facts, however, she won't sign a release form for me to talk to her. I try to help, really, it's hard to put up with though, I'm autistic and when she's in an episode she tells me I'm retarded and uses stuff against me, threatens to cheat again, the BPD is a monster, she is lovely, but I don't speak to her often, mostly just the BPD now... I have 1000 questions and honestly my mind is so muddled after everything she's put me through over the past 6 or so months that I can't even put together a coherent question, I'll probably post again when I think of one. She is ""bored"" of dating me, but I know she can't handle life without me, she has devalued me already and now I am ""all bad"", yet she still craves my attention, she tells me I've done something wrong and will start screaming, but when I ask what, she can't even give a reason. This will not get better without treatment, but she will not get treated correctly without the therapist knowing everything, but without the release form being signed, I can't tell her anything... I don't see a way out until I am with her in person and can physically prove that things are ok, as she is very receptive to physical affection. There is no point to this post, I don't think at least, I don't really know what I'm thinking or feeling to be fair, this has fucked with me to the extreme. I just need a way out, not of the relationship, out of what it has become, a way back to the past, the old her, I love her and I know she makes me happy, I've been with her for nearly 2 years now, but I hate the BPD, I'm staying for no other reason than I'm holding out hope that the real her will be back one day. Until then, all I can do is wait and suffer through it all..."

How can I stop obsessing over my FP?,1,mhsmzc,2,"Has anyone ever successfully switched their favorite person on purpose? Like I know its probably impossible to not have one at all, but I just wish I wasn't so attached to my current FP. For multiple reasons he is not always available and it really screws with my moods. How can I get over this?"
Not sure on how to cope with my husband joining the military soon.,1,mhshl3,3,"We never agreed on this. The military has always been something he wanted to experience. I sparked multiple explosive fights over the years, but as I began realizing how selfish I was being, I had let go a bit. I’m still not okay with his decision, and I’m scared shitless. But still, I want him to regret nothing when he’s old.

A little background, we made 13 years in 2020, and finally tied the knot January of this year. He began being more and more proactive in his journey in joining the military, and now we’re just waiting on his ship date. 

For a while, I kept putting it in the back of my mind to cope and be able to function in my daily activities, but as the time gets closer, I feel a void in my chest. And my stomach drops at the thought of dropping him off when he needs to leave for basic.

I’m now entering into a depressive state of mind. A mild, but steadily growing depression. I feel it because I find it harder to wake up in the morning, fall asleep at night, do any school work, focus, and I’m always tired... this is how my body reacts to depression and anxiety.

I recently started seeing a new therapist, and she wants me to find friends and hobbies to occupy my time, but I really can’t function without my husband. My husband is my best friend. He’s pretty much my only friend. Other people exhaust me. As shitty as that sounds of me, it’s the whole truth. I really, really fucking can’t. It’s not even a choice at this point. I’m genuinely scared of what the state of my mental health is going to be like once he’s gone. We haven’t slept away from each other in almost 7 years."
Obsessions over random people,75,mh3n4m,7,"DAE who has social media find people who they idolize and base their own style, mannerisms and physical on for like a week and then drop them and move on...? I’ve done this with a ton of people and it never lasts over like 2 weeks. I think it contributes to my lack of identity. I also impulsive buy a lot of different clothes in these phases :/"
Living hell,12,mhf1gm,2,"I wanted to do something today. I have felt different yesterday. I will feel different tomorrow. Nothing is persistent, nothing. Everything changes so frequently. It is impossible to achieve anything great and meaningful, no matter how much I want... but I know I will stop wanting it eventually, maybe tomorrow, maybe in the next hour, maybe even before I finish this. It doesn't matter, my views are different each day. 

People are simple, people are persistent. They are who they are and they are who they have always been. Change is what I am. Nothing is permanent. Achieving anything socially related is impossible. I have given up trying.

Work. Work helps me forget. Reading helps me forget. Born to suffer. Life is empty. Life is terribly long. I'm not afraid of death. I'm afraid of my condition. There is no future, there is no past.

Religion doesn't work. Alcohol doesn't work. Nothing works. Nothing calms me down when it comes. Working myself to death works. I forget. I put my attention elsewhere.

Life expectancy is about 80 years for men in the developed countries. It means that from this moment I've only recently finished the first quarter. It scares me."

I moved to a different country for someone and although everyone speaks English fluently there are moments where people will switch to their language right in front of me and it makes me want to crawl out of my skin. My boyfriend tries really hard to accommodate, but there are many times where that is not the case. I feel like it’s a BPD individuals nightmare. You can’t help but feel left out and you’re left with intense feelings of shame, and it’s hard to bounce back especially when you’re in a social setting. It makes me scared for the next party that happens. Almost everyone here speaks English fluently, but they often choose to speak in their own language. I get stuck in this loop of feeling like “yeah that’s pretty inconsiderate” to “no I’m just a loser and I  just need to accept it.” It’s a confusing feeling and I don’t want to feel this intensely about it. Help?"
I don’t know,6,mhjbem,7,"I don’t really know what to do. I’m being invited to go to a campfire and drink with some friends and I want to go but there’s something holding me back and I can’t bring myself to go. I don’t know what to do, because I don’t know why I’m afraid to go, I just feel like I’ll regret it for some reason I don’t know why. It hurts.

Like I know that if I don’t go, all I’m gonna do is lay in bed regretting it. But I still can’t fucking do it. Sorry.

Someone please help me"
It would be easier if I was single,2,mho3js,11,"My life would be so much easier if my husband just left me. I work so hard to be normal and he doesn’t get it. One wrong tone of voice and he treats me like I haven’t improved at all. 

Leaving him would make my life so much easier. My life would suck and I would be incredibly lonely but it would be so so so much easier."
How do you deal with guilt?,11,mhe1wr,2,"I'm having an extremely hard time constantly thinking back on how much emotional weight I would put on my friends and I don't know what to do. I feel useless. I cant interact with anyone without them feeling obligated to help me and having no idea how and then they feel bad, which in turn makes me feel horrible. Every one of my friends I somehow tell them too much about my life and they just stare and go ""I'm so sorry but I don't know how to help."" Everytime I hear that my heart drops. Great, I've done it again. What the fuck do I do. I'm currently isolating myself until I find just some sort of plan to limit my oversharing but I'm having a difficult time.

Should people with BPD avoid relationships with other people who have mental health issues?,2,mhnouv,7,"Does anyone have an opinion about whether it's best for a person with BPD to date so-called ""normal"" people instead of other folks with mental health conditions? I've started talking to someone on an app and we've been bonding over our shared experiences with mental health, which has been really refreshing. But at the same time, I'm wondering if it's a bad idea to combine two people who have problems? I just tend to find that ""normal"" people are more judgmental and less understanding of what I deal with. What have been your guys' experiences with dating other people with conditions? Do you think it makes for less healthy relationships, or do you feel more understood?"
BPD is not cute,617,mgqeyt,50,"Having BPD means having a good day and doubting your diagnosis. It means feeling like you are a manipulative bitch no matter what you do or say. It means deciding on a drastic hair or style change to finally find yourself. It means your ""happiness"" being entirely dependent on how much attention you get from that one chosen person. It's turning something ""minor"" into something world-ending. It's turning nothing into everything and everything into nothing. It's like sitting in the passenger seat of a car and watching the driver crash into a tree without being able to do anything to stop it. It's losing the will to live over a late reply to a text. It's losing your shit over a casual response. It's constantly analysing everything you said, every gesture you made, every look, everything you didn't say, everything someone else said or didn't say, that eye contact they didn't make.

It's when asking for help feels like you're a burden. It's feeling alone and misunderstood when you're the centre of attention. It's a constant battle of questioning whether your reaction was appropriate considering the situation. It's excusing mistreatment from others, because you think you probably deserved it. It means forgiving the unforgiveable because being alone is worse. It's the constant battle between lightness and darkness, and the fear of what's to come.

It's constantly being scared of losing those you love one way or another. It's constantly asking yourself if this will be the last time they forgive you. It's the fear of those closest to you waking up one day and realising they can do much better than you. It's feeling like you are constantly duping people into liking you, because you're never quite yourself. It's hating every part of yourself, even though you don't know which of them are real. It's wanting to relieve others of your burden. It's the constant struggle of wanting to end your pain, but not hurting anyone in the process. It's the urge to cut yourself, because it feels good to feel a different kind of pain.

It's filling yourself up with goods, food or drugs to feel like you're not an empty shell and never succeeding. It's realising that every compliment or every bit of positivity gets lost immediately in that black hole inside of you. It's having an all-consuming need for re-affirmation every second of every day, because people change their minds. It's blaming every single thing that goes wrong in your life or in some else's life on yourself. It means never being relaxed because there are about 100 thoughts racing through your head at any given time. It's getting used to pain and still being overwhelmed by it every single time. It's the all-consuming wave of feeling everything and nothing."
Need to be prettiest,16,mhaokm,4,"I struggle with BDD too but this feeling I am on about is kind of different, I have this need to be the most beautiful woman in the entire world and for everyone to think this! Every woman, every man even though I have a BF, modelling agents and brands who hire for jobs and of course especially my BF. I want everyone to think I’m the most stunning girl ever. I am a model and went into modelling for validation. I’ve always been complimented with people saying I am the most beautiful woman they’ve ever seen many times I think this is what makes me feel the need for EVERYONE to think it I’m addicted to validation. I won’t ever be seen without makeup or hair done as it’s less than perfect. I need to be stunning I need everyone to dream of being me of being with me but I HATE this need - I am a kind person who cares not at all about the appearance of others I will never entertain any kind of bitching especially negativity about people’s appearance. I don’t even care about looks in a relationship at all although my partner is v attractive. I get constant extreme validation that I’m stunning and the best looking woman they know but it’s still not enough and if I don’t get a compliment or everyone looks at me except one or if I feel are people looking at me way less as I drive by bc I have no makeup on when really people are looking at me I just more so notice ones doing their own thing who wouldn’t have noticed me makeup or not bc they just weren’t even looking. I wish I could explain the episodes this creates for me my bf has always said I’m most beautiful woman ever why are you with me his friends family colleagues joke this to him too and that I’m stunning he says I’m perfect and tells me constantly of all the compliments people tell him about me and they make me feel great but not that great yet one look or one comment I could take a diff meaning like say someone says someone is attractive whilst I’m there my illogical brain says why didn’t they say but they’re not better than you etc even if it’s a friend saying oh Margot Robbie looks nice there I think is she way better than me anything can cause a major spiral and I hate it it feels narcissistic but I’m not and I hate feeling this way bc I don’t care about looks I’m so kind and loving but I can spiral at my bf even if someone pretty on tv I say you must fancy them he’s like what?

Does anyone else get a movie type thing play out in your head when you think/are told a bad situation/scenario MIGHT happen?,3,mhkyk2,2,"Like whenever I get told something bad might happen or I get bad news that 'movie' type thing plays in my head and I act like that's what is 100% going to happen.

For example my boyfriend said he might admit himself to a psych ward and I've been panicking ever since and i get a 'movie' play in my head of him going in, our relationship ending from nonexistent communication, he gets worse etc and then I end up acting like that is exactly what's going to happen
It causes a lot of issues and I'm not sure if it's a bpd thing, a trauma thing etc."
DAE want to reject your progress and recovery?,8,mhdwb0,4,For the past few months or so I would say I’ve gotten pretty okay and stabilised in a sense and not as self destructive as I used to be. Things are going okay for me but for some reason I wanna to reject everything and go back to that dark period of my life. I want to go back to those days where I was immensely self destructive and romanticised it and I want to stop taking my medication and stop seeking help. Does feel like doing this ? I don’t understand where this is coming from and why I think like this.
"Diagnosed with bipolar and BPD traits, but not full BPD?",3,mhjxk8,4,"I’ve had bpd signs since I was 8 and today was diagnosed with BPD traits, I kinda anticipated this but I’m still upset over it lol. I’m just confused as to how BPD traits is different than BPD? My new psych recognized it pretty quickly but said she didn’t think I had “full” bpd

I also have ADHD and bipolar 2 so that complicates things more. Should I go ahead and buy a DBT workbook or something? Reading about bpd all day has made me realize how toxic I am sometimes and now I’m very self conscious 😭

I personally think I reach the diagnostic criteria but idk. I’m guessing I should learn BPD coping skills and stay on my meds but it’s kind of disheartening that someone noticed this about me so quickly....

And side note: does anyone have tips for managing bipolar 2 and bpd?? I’m on lamictal and ability, but I can’t see a therapist for a few months. I need to get my act together bc rn I’m failing school and need a job but this shit is hard to figure out!!

Why is being perfect not enough to avoid abandonment?,23,mh638t,13,"TW: severe domestic violence

I have largely recovered, I’m a good partner and I have a lot of other good qualities, but it’s never enough. I have to be ABSOLUTELY perfect and that’s only so people will kiiinda like me. No one will ever love me. And it hurts even worse because others who are abusive or toxic have loyal partners. Whywon’t anyone love me like that?? E.g., the last man I dated had stayed with someone for 6+ years who tried to kill and mutilate him. But he refused to commit and just strung me along and then threw me away when he got bored. And I’m lucky - before that, my other ex would threaten to leave me any time I showed emotion or disagreeed, and then left me after he seriously assaulted me. Why am I not enough??? What am Insupposed to do? What are ithers doing that they can find love and a loyal partner while they abuse them but I can’t? I feel so hopeless"
DAE feel like they never really lived freely? + age anxiety,12,mhahm9,10,"I am an extremely co-dependent person. When I say this I really mean it. I am in relationships since I am 17. I was single maximum 2 months.

I don't feel safe alone. Yet I never experienced living life when I only care about myself. Like I can go to a festival and hookup with somebody if I like. Or just talk and have fun with guys without wondering when will I have to reject them (since I have a bf). Or have sexual experiences which I cannot live with my boyfriend. Anything. Or just go abroad without worrying about him cheating. Really anything!

I have no clue how it is to be single. I don't complain because I might simply would be dysfunctional. But still I wonder.

On top of it I have age anxiety (especially since this pandemic) and wonder whether I will ever really live a colourful life or I will be too old and just regret that I have never lived.

(Age anxiety is extra strong because I never had problems with guys finding me attractive but I know that age doesn't have mercy on anybody and one day I won't be as desirable as I am now.)"
My FP Went No Contact and I'm Drowning. Any Words Of Advice On Mitigating This Unbearable Pain?,3,mhji9j,1,"My FP was also my SO.

Did I make the right choice?,5,mhgab1,5,"I woke up crying nonstop. Went to a doctor and I was still crying. I cried in his office for almost an hour, couldn't look at him in the eyes (a regular general medicine doctor, not a psychiatrist). He told me to calm down and gave me a sick leave for today and tomorrow but I plan on working tomorrow to avoid problems at work.

I called my boss explaining the situation, I asked if I could be honest, I said I was depressed because of my birthday and having no family and having my birthday alone and I just started crying hard over the phone and she told me to calm down, that the company cared about me.

I was dead honest on everything, and I hate skipping my job. But I'm up to date on my work and we're having a fuckton of holidays, I could catch up during these days.

Anyways, do you think I did the right thing? I'm no longer crying. I think crying that hard actually helped me let go off some pain. I didn't even say I had depression or anything else, I specifically said I was feeling depressed for X and that it won't happen again."
help. i’m scared to get diagnosed!,2,mhlkcc,5,"hello... i am an 18 ur old cis-gendered bisexual black female. yes. there’s a lot to unpack there. where do i start lol. i think i have BPD but i rly don’t want to self diagnose. i don’t want to go to the GP because i called them the other day and they sounded so patronising and i don’t think that the UK is the best with meds and treatment for mental illness and stuff. i also would just like a professional opinion so i can show my boyfriend. i would like him to believe that what i’m saying is important, and i don’t want this to ruin our relationship. 
let me just list my symptoms :

intrusive thoughts - sexualising everything. thinking about women in a disgusting way, sexualising children or infants. hurting people etc. ( these thoughts gross me out and i would never act on them but i can’t get the out of my head )
impulsive - as soon as i think... i do. 
really REALLY bad self esteem one day and then a GOD like complex the next
i can’t reside whether i’m a lesbian or bisexual like everyday i struggle - this is the biggest bullet point in my opinion. i’m in a long (and happy) heterosexual relationship BUT i have never been with a woman. so the list and attraction to all females is HUGE. this consumes my everyday thoughts. 
constantly try to break up with sig. other 
constantly feel like i need to change myself 
fear of abandonment - i hate knowing that i will be alone. i have to plan what i’m going to o on my ‘alone day’ and keep myself entertained 
suicidal thoughts
i used to self harm but it caused a lot of problems at home and people noticed at school so i stopped. 
drug misuse 
reckless driving 

some events that may have fucked me up mentally: 
- raped at 13 by a 21 year old that went to prison for murder not long after 
- introduced to sexual intimacy at a young age (5yrs) 
- had nudes sent everywhere 
- trapped in an abusive relationship with someone much older than me at 15 
- started using drugs at 13"
Kicked out of ''friends'',5,mhgkz6,1,"(I never know which flair to post. Sorry for the long rant) Or well I thought they were my friends :) Guess not huh. I wasn't doing my chores on time because I was super depressed and that's why they kicked me out(I was starting to feel better after a bit and was going to start doing them again) I literally went to the emergency room when they announced it so that I wouldn't do anything stupid and in the span of 16 hours they had already found a new roommate, lol.... just fucking hilarious, as if this wasn't planned from the beginning. Needless to say there was a lot of splitting and I hate them but they are also the only people that regularly play video games with me so... yeah I need them right now but they certainly don't need me. The worst part is that the girl(who was the owner of the house) is still trying to be friendly with me and acts as if nothing happened and that this is fine. I just fucking hate how she reacts to my memes. We are not friends. I repeat. WE ARE NOT FRIENDS AND I HATE YOU. I hope I find a new group of people soon but I am also resigned to my own self-destruction. I feel lost and I don't really know what to do. I hope I meet new friends soon, would let me leave those people and finally let go of the past.

"[24M] lost Psychiatric, DBT, and Therapy services yesterday - FUCK the system",11,mha3w6,6,"Ready for stupid and long story that shows how fucked up the system really is?

So, for 14 months I have been doing psychiatric and therapy services at, lets say, ""K"". My first 2 psychiatrists, by the way, were terrible. My current/former one, DrF, is fantastic and she really listened to me.

A few months ago, my therapist FC recommended I do an IOP. So DrF made the referral when I brought it up so it goes by faster than having FC make it. DrF also makes the DBT group referral the same day, with the wait list being approximately TWO MONTHS long for me to start.

IOP starts 1 month later.

So I do IOP with AW. She is really good, and she recommended this program for BPD that K contracts out with LL. AW makes the initial referal and I try to go into it - and everything starts going to hell (not that I knew it yet).

I finish IOP after 1 month, I do a transitional, less-intensive IOP which is just stage 2. I start DBT at the same day as transitional IOP (magic, I know).

Then I talk to DrF again at a new appointment and suddenly she says she received a message that day she isn't supposed to see me anymore because I have been transferred to the county (NOT AT MY REQUEST, but at a ""contractual obligiation that K has""). She said she kept the appointment for me anyway because she knew just having no notification or advice is wrong.

I file a complaint with K's member services. My case manager says my therapy and DBt won't be affected and that only psychiatry is. Two weeks later, yesterday - I get 2 calls, fiirst saying my individual therapy is cancelled, and then another 10 minutes later saying DBT is cancelled (AFTER I WAS IN THE PROGRAM FOR A MONTH AFTER BEING ON THE WAITLIST FOR 2 MONTHS)

Why was I sent to county? Because of the severity of my symptoms - but they have been the SAME FOR 14 MONTHS. Why now? Because of trying to get into that program AW recommended that THE COUNTY DOESNT EVEN KNOW ABOUT OR CONTRACT WITH.

There is no continuing care right now after suddenly losing all my behavioral health services.

My case will be reviewed by a panel of chief psychiatrists tomorrow to see if the mandated transference to county is ""valid"" or not. I also filed a complaint this morning with the county department of behavioral health for making me lose ALL of my services, having no continuing care, AND having LESS services than K provides to begin with.

The system is completely fucked up. All because AW said to do this program that she worked in that K contracts with, and it made me lose EVERYTHING.

Even if I can go back to services at K and get my psychiatrist and therapist back, my place in DBT is absolutely fucked. 3 months down the drain. It might take up to SEVEN MORE MONTHS to get back to where I was in DBT.

I really, really, really, am tempted to just go take that bus ride and jump off the Golden Gate Bridge and die. Because this completely ruined me yesterday. I cried for the first time in a very long and I almost broke my no self-harming over a year and I unfortunately yelled at my cat and scared her (I did not do anything physical, just yelling)

Fuck the system. Fuck being alive."
How do you cope with the lockdown loneliness?,7,mhbhkv,1,"Today felt like one of the loneliest days I have ever had. Actually the last couple of days have all felt like that. 

Across my laptop and my phone my screen time averages to nearly 13 hours a day which I find quite embarrassing. I keep deleting social media apps to get some momentum into my life outside of the digital world but it always comes back before I fall asleep. 

My screen time was a bit lesser today as I spent a good while just crying. But it was still enough thats I read every single post that was posted on this sub in the last week. It kind of gave me a sense of feeling less lonely as I had people I could relate to. I have no way of stepping outside my house to talk to physical human beings. I feel like if covid drags on for a few more months I'll just completely get detached from the real world. 

Has anyone struggled with a digital screen ""addiction"" and if yes how do I fix this and have a normal relationship with my phone and social media?"
"""Why do I fall in love with everyone that shows even the slightest interest in me?""",76,mgz0ft,22,"""Why do I fall in love with everyone that shows even the slightest interest in me?""

This is somewhat common with BPD. The reason it happens is that humans have a certain minimum level of personal relationship that they desperately crave. BPD people are usually well below that minimum, due to their tendency to wreck most relationships ( romantic or otherwise)

Thus, a BPD individual is literally starving for a relationship, even if they know it is likely going to fall apart eventually. So when they get even the *start* of a relationship, its like oats for a starving person -- might not be tasty, but they are desperate for the food, and might even eat it raw.

So as soon as the relationship shows the tiniest bit of promise, well thats like cake, and a BPD will desperately pounce on that, and devour it in seconds.  

The best advice I can give is get into low-stakes, non-sexual relationships (aka friendships).  It will get you used to humans and talking, and not being quite as relationship starved.  Then work your way up to the more serious sort of relationship.  Hopefully you will have gained some experience and skills (but nothing compares to DBT, please give it a try, even if it's just reading the books).  
Don't expect this to be magic; the point of it is just going to dull the euphoria of ""OMG human interest"" a little so that you stay slightly more calm and sane.

My fp absolutely hates me :((,1,mhnn0n,1,"I don’t know how long this will be I’m typing on a whim but my favorite person genuinely despises me. Recently I found out through another friend via screenshots that he’s talked so mych trash about me such as calling me super annoying, saying I’m a literal snowflake and way too sensitive, disliking me, etc. I’ve had so many anxiety attacks over the past days about it and I don’t know what to do. I love him romantically too and I still do, I’m just so distraught over this and feel so empty it’s so much to process and I still want to talk to him about it I don’t even know what to do :((. I’m also a minor with bpd if that helps anything 😭 I really do love him so much and it’s not even his fault and he’s also lied to me on so many occasions and manipulated me too. I thought his feelings towards me were genuine but it was all a massive manipulation scheme. He’s also called me manipulative too when I never had inteneded to manipulate him, in fact I’ve said a countless amount of times that I had this huge fear of coming off as manipulative and all. I’m just so tired I can’t even sleep because I’m so fucking anxious I just wish to speak to him once again because he blocked me :(( I think I deserve it because I had blocked him about four times before cause I got so so angry over the smallest things and was trying so hard not to lash out even though he said it was “fine.”"
DAE get sudden burst of energy or the need to be productive and do any work after a depressive episode?,44,mh15jk,6,"I recently had a depressive episode for weeks where i would sleep till noon, wake up, feel like shit, avoid everyone, and ignore calls and texts and would delay assignments till the end. but since 2 days i’m feeling better and now i have all this energy where i feel like i have to do some work. i submitted all my assignments but i want more just so i can do something or i will go crazy. i’m socializing and finding things to do like clean my room and stuff. i would like to know your opinions on this."
“Meatball Surgery” challenging perfectionism,4,mhdw2w,2,"I learned a useful metaphor from my therapist to challenge perfectionism and I wanted to share. It comes from the book/movie M.A.S.H. (Mobil Army Surgical Hospital). The concept is called meatball surgery. Apparently when wounded soldiers came to MASH, they were badly wounded and in need of immediate quick surgery in order to hold them over until they could be transported to a real hospital. This example uses a soldier with a serious intestinal wound. There are 3 walls to the intestine, and in a regular hospital, it is best practice to sew each layer individually. However, in the MASH unit, the patients with these injuries were so badly injured and there were so many to get to, that there was not time to see each layer on its own. Rather, “meatball surgery” was used, and all three layers were sutured at once. If the doctors in the MASH unit had tried to follow “best practices” and sew each layer one at a time, more people would die than if they used meatball surgery and got a lot of patients sewed up good enough” to be transported. I am working to apply this concept to my own life. This metaphor helps me to remember that sometimes doing something “perfect” actually prevents me from seeing the bigger picture and making the most of my time. It reminds me that sometimes doing “good enough” is actually better in the long run than striving for perfection. Idk if this will help anyone else but it was kind of a breakthrough for me so thought I’d share just in case. ❤️💪"
Has anyone ever had their bpd caused by events in later life instead of childhood?,2,mhjmzs,2,"from what I’ve read, you develop bpd because of events in your childhood.

I had a relatively happy childhood with good parents. I had an instance of being “left behind”, by my sister when she moved away. I was about 5. that’s fed my abandonment but otherwise, I was pretty happy. 

I dated someone from 17 through 19 and they emotionally and verbally abused me daily for those 2 1/2 years. I’m an absolute wreck now. I barely function half the time, honestly. I have the most unstable mood imaginable and I have every symptom of bpd. 

I feel like I am the way I am because of him. 

This is getting long so I’ll cut it here. I know it’s something I should probably ask a doctor but I don’t have one right now, so I’m just interested in you guys’ experiences and opinions."
Does anyone else self isolate in the most extreme ways when one small thing upsets you?,58,mgzk91,17,"The other day I was watching a show with my fp and in between episodes I started just spilling to him EVERYTHING I going on in my mind currently. It was a lot. It was so so much. I would apologize after every message and most of them were 100+ words. He's nt and had no real idea what to do with me, but that's an issue I've always had with people, they have no clue how to help. I start to spiral and think about how no one can help me and started looking at articles to find out how to deal with myself but every article turned out to be a ""How to deal with a loved one with BPD""

This sent me over the edge. I have to be dealt with? My entire life? I will be a constant burden to people and always be a nuisance? What the hell? I then became overcome with despair thinking about how people who love me will have to go out of their way to have a good relationship with me, and their mental health will still get weakened from having to constantly reassure me and take my random accusations of paranoia. I couldn't take the thought of being people's burden and how I must hurt people's mental health. 

I am now completely isolated. I logged out and deleted all social media, told my fp I'm leaving and will be back once I'm better, muted all my friends, and leave my phone in my room. I'm constantly watching shows now and finding things to distract me from the moments I would have rather been talking to people. Please tell me people do this as well. Random isolation. Complete isolation. Why do I do this so often. Why do I get riddled with guilt randomly and make such drastic actions?"
DAE have worse symptoms in the morning upon waking up?,15,mh5ubw,11,"Idk if this is a bpd thing or if i’m just awful, but i wake up feeling everything all at once and i am the angriest, meanest, most emotional and overwhelmed person in the morning. i cry, i yell, i say awful things, and i have majorrrr executive dysfunction and it’s so difficult and frustrating to start the day like that. i just wanna be normal. anyone else experience this? does anyone have any coping skills that might help?"

Giving Up,10,mh83zd,2,"Monday night I wrecked my car.  I was driving through the country, didn't realize a turn was coming, and went to veer out of the way.  Ended up hitting a bump that through my car through the air, Dukes of Hazzard style.  I'm okay.  Just hit my head a little and I'm sore.

But this was our only working car.  Our other 2 cars are also in the shop.  We never got our stimulus, so we were already struggling.  I'm just tired of never getting ahead, of being an idiot and making things worse.

My marriage is falling apart (he has downloaded dating apps, but claims he was just looking at it for porno purposes, but this makes me feel unwanted/unloved).  We have different love languages and can't ever seem to connect.  Everything he does annoys me.  Add onto the above mentioned issues, I'm experiencing limerence for another, too.  I want to just scrap my marriage that sucks and pursue the limerence, but I'm not 100% sure it is reciprocated.

Everything is just confusing and awful.  I have been microdosing, and it was working at first, but now it's just like regular medication--the suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety always comes back.  Therapy is slow-going. 

I'm just tired.  Tired of always trying to fight against this disorder, against the current. Tired of DBT and always being hyper aware of my moods and triggers. I just want to LIVE. I want to just wake up and go through my day without dissecting everything. I want to just be okay, just be happy once in a while. Tired of drama and money issues.

I wish I would have died in that car accident.  Going to the ER for suicidal ideation doesn't help either.  They just band-aid you with meds and pat you on the head and send you back out into the world."
First fight with my boyfriend and I feel broken,3,mhg18a,1,"Last night I got into somewhat of a fight with my boyfriend/fp of 5 months, and it's the first time it escalated like this. Long story short, after work he said he was having a bad day and that I could come over if I want, but he wouldn't be in the best of moods. I wanted to be supportive, so I went over even though I just started Wellbutrin and my anxiety is through the roof. He seemed to be slowly cheering up, and things were good until I had a panic attack from a combination of the new meds, going through a change at work, having not slept in 2 days, and being hungry. 

He noticed me crying, asked what was wrong, and I told him exactly that and expressed that I felt bad for putting attention on me when he was feeling bad. He got super quiet and starting deep breathing, I apologized again and he apologized for not knowing what to say. I told him it was fine and that all I really wanted was a hug, which he gave me. Then he went downstairs and had an emotional outburst of his own. I could hear him throwing things and punching walls, and I felt so bad. I feel like I messed up. When he came back upstairs, he got super crossfaded and pretended like nothing happened. Things still feel super tense, though.

I'm so scared that he's going to break up with me over this. I hope he doesn't throw things away over one rough night, but with bpd it's hard to see any other end to this."
out of weed,4,mhdkab,3,"i just ran out of weed, though i stopped getting ""high"" from it a while ago. been smoking consistently since last June, july? idk.  i haven't gone one day without it in over a month, i am terrified kinda. I've relied on it for months but it didn't feel like i needed it until more recently. i literally knew it would end up like this. i have no self control. moderation doesnt exist. i am miserable lol."
Bpd and loss,3,mhfeom,2,"So my mom has always been my ultimate FP. She was always a huge support for me in my life and through my struggles. I usually have a “regular” FP, the person who has held that place for me has been my guy friend of a year and a half. Through that time we were always extremely close, hung out ALL the time, and he was very helpful in being there for me. Well last October, my mom passed away from cancer. I really don’t have any words to say about it, it’s like there’s a hole in my heart and a black cloud looming over my life. I don’t really talk about it or show the world how it’s effecting me, she’s just gone. Now recently, my guy friend made a new friend and he wants to spend ALL of his time with him. Whenever I go over to his house, he’s hanging out with him for maybe 90% of the time and then for a few minutes, he’ll come hang out with me. I was okay with hanging out with both of them at first, but this new friend is constantly saying something prejudice or homophobic, and my friend gets mad at me when I try to call him out, he just wants me to let that stuff he says go. I feel like I’ve lost the people in my life that care about me, and there’s nothing much left anymore and I’m really struggling"
Don’t think I can ever give 100% of myself to anyone,5,mhbu5w,7,"Anyone else feel like no matter how much you care or how strongly you feel about someone, you just can’t fully give yourself 100%? I just feel like a part of me will always have an escape plan in the back of my mind, just in case one day I wake up and convince myself that the happiness I have is just a fantasy. I recently have found someone who makes me happier than ever, but I just can’t fully allow myself to just let my guard down and to just relax and allow myself to fully invest and give my all without any doubts or worries. Obviously BPD and self sabotage go hand in hand together since having a distorted sense of self worth is almost a daily struggle. I guess I’m just wondering if I ever will be able to just relax fully in my relationship and have peace of mind that everything is perfectly okay and enjoy it fully and whole heartedly?"
being alone,2,mhhvjs,3,"so, yesterday I was having a pretty bad episode, still feeling pretty low, but trying to claw my way back up, anyway, my husband came home for his lunch break and I cried my eyes out for a hour straight, because everything feels so over whelming, I’m working on getting back in to therapy, I don’t have insurance because I don’t have a job, so that makes things extra hard. just was feeling all around lost and like everything is out of control. fast forward to when he gets home from work, (we’ve discussed opening up our relationship to be poly (sorry if not the correct term) before so it’s not out of field) he says “another reason why I want to bring another person into our relationship is so that you always have someone around for you because things seem to be worse when you’re alone and I’m not there to keep your mind off of things” I understand where he is coming from, but I can’t help but feel like he thinks I need a babysitter if that makes sense? I don’t know."
Thinking every person you fall in love with is “the one”?,41,mgzxuj,10,"It’s kind of embarrassing, but I’m like this. If there’s any connection, I think it’s the best one. When the relationship inevitably ends, I think my life is worthless now that they’re gone, and that they were my only shot at true love/my soulmate. Until the next relationship. I’m so stupid."
I was just diagnosed,4,mhcvhw,4,So I was just diagnosed with bpd after being told I had depression a an anxiety only since I was 16. I don’t really know how to handle some of my toxic behavior and it’s effecting my relationship. I’m very confused about my diagnoses in the first place. I’ve never really heard of bpd before and I was hoping to come here and get some advice and support. I’ve been struggling a lot lately with just terrible hostility to the people I love. I don’t believe a word anyone close to me tells especially when it comes to things like they care and love me and I feel like I’m going down a. Reoccurring path of self sabotage
"Yo, you! Yes, you!",616,mgieec,65,"You are not the weird awkward freak you think you are. You rock. People love to have you around. You brighten up a room when you enter it and those that matter will do what it takes to be understanding of your struggles. Never forget it and never let anyone make you feel like you're not worthy of love or affection or validation just because you have BPD. Therapist told me to try out telling others that are struggling what I feel like I need to hear, so I hope this helps!"
Bpd and soulmates?,2,mhha35,3,"Have you ever met someone and believed they were/are your soulmate? Did you ever get over them? What happened? 
I’ve always been one to fall hard when I get involved with someone BUT I’m always easily able to pull myself back and detach if needed. 
I’ve slept with someone a couple of times and I feel this overwhelming sense of love and caring for them, I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM, I literally can’t get him out of my head and it makes me feel so insane. I’m very intuitive and have a strong feeling that we’re supposed to be together but he’s in a relationship and we aren’t speaking. I feel so crazy.  Anyone have advice or something on this?"

My boyfriend wants to put himself in a mental hospital and I don't know what to do.,1,mhkp3z,0,"My boyfriend (let's call him L) is really struggling with (undiagnosed) OCD. He wants to admit himself to a mental hospital in the town we both live in. The mental hospital in our town is really bad, I had a friend who just about escaped from there and my mums friend who used to work there had to quit because of the way the patients were being treated.

He hasn't even tried one on one therapy, group therapy or any kind of therapy yet even though I've told him he should try that before admitting himself. Hell, he isn't even diagnosed yet (it's clear that he has it and he has all of the symptoms). I've told him he needs to get diagnosed and get therapy but he is insistent on admitting himself even though when he goes in he will lose contact with me, his friends, what healthy coping mechanisms he has left and his pets. I told him locking himself away from everyone and everything he likes isnt going to solve anything, why isnt he going to try getting help outside the mental hospital where he can still do the things he loves and maintain a relationship with me? 

I want what's best for him but I'm feeling so conflicted, my bpd is really bad at the moment and I feel like I'm being abandoned. He's the first person to know about my bpd, I've only just been diagnosed and now I'm losing him too. It feels like I'm losing everyone I care about and that the others are just trying to find ways to get away from me. I have 'friends' but hes the only one I actually have if you get what I mean. While hes in there he isnt allowed a phone and I'm not going to be able to cope on only being able to see him once a week, if that. Everything is falling apart.

I wish I could help him but once again I have no control over anything and I dont know what to do. He won't listen to me.
Am I selfish for not wanting him to go in, even though I've only heard bad things about mental hospitals?

I don't want him to go in, get worse and not come out for years and I don't want our relationship to end but I also want him to get better."
I've been ghosted and can't handle the pain,2,mhg2ls,6,"So I was speaking to a guy I really like and he said he really likes me. We recently rekindled after a year of not talking. Over a year ago when we were speaking, I really liked him and he liked me, but I kept splitting and blocking him as a result. He would always reach out, but in the end he gave up as I went back to my ex (I didn't know I had bpd at the time).
So I reached out to him recently and we were talking for 2 weeks and saw it each other twice. Both times he said he really likes me and hopefully we get together. He also said he's talking other people, but doesn't want to hurt me so thought he'd let me know. This was on Friday. We spoke for hours kissed and enjoyed each other's company. The next day I didn't hear from him much, but he invited me to meet him at a gathering in the evening. He ended up leaving the place so we didn't meet. I messaged him good morning the next morning and he didn't respond, but after a day it said he read it. I waited a few days and then decided to call him yesterday. He didn't answer or call or message me back, but he watched my Instagram story. 
I'm sooo hurt and confused. One of my triggers is rejection. So I've broken down completely. 
To make things worse, my favourite person (my friend) told me she wasn't feeling good so she'd get back to me about my message I sent her on Monday and I haven't heard from her since. Then I saw today on her status that she's gone to a spa hotel and is happy and fine. I just feel like no-one cares about me and I'm not important and not good enough. I can't stop crying and I feel like there must be something wrong with me."
DAE constantly repeat this cycle,80,mgv38r,10,"
It goes like this 

1. Symptoms aren't too bad, I am quite functional despite feeling a low level of mental pain all of the time. During this time I am sometimes convinced that I never actually had BPD or that I am cured. 


2. Symptoms get triggered, usually by a relationship issue. I am now barely functional, constantly in a great amount of emotional and mental pain. I get very self destructive, start using a lot of drugs, starting fights with my FP. Crying pretty much every day. Increasingly suicidal


3. Decide to go to therapy because I can no longer live like this anymore. Symptoms start to improve again and I feel stable. 



4. Drop out of therapy because I feel better, am too distracted by my busy life and would rather invest my time in other endeavors. 

Rinse and repeat. I hate myself."
Mother's relationships triggering me.,2,mhfee3,1,"I'm going to try to summarize this as best I can, but throughout my life my mother has had numerous relationships. I've often felt as if my mother depends and relies on me for validation and attention when she's single, but then she'll enter a new relationship with a man and essentially ""forget"" about me. She stops reaching out as often. She's harder to get in touch with and she becomes less empathetic. I feel abandoned and rejected. I'm fucking 29, but it still gets to me. I don't know how to feel or if I'm being selfish, but I feel like my emotions are justified and I'm sick and tired of her using me when she needs me and then brushing me aside like I'm nothing when she doesn't need me anymore."
Reminder that choosing not to forgive someone who hurt you isn't always holding a grudge.,46,mgx6to,2,"Something I've been working through this month. Choosing not to forgive is a way to hold someone accountable, and rather than take some kind of revenge on them, you leave them be, at arms length.

Stay safe everyone ❤️"
I need coping mechanisms to help me with losing my FP,6,mh7au2,4,"My favorite person has been my boyfriend for the past year, we recently broke up but we’re still friends. He told me he thinks he might be moving, and i don’t know how to cope with that. Ive tried to do things to distract my brain but everything i do reminds me of him and then i get sad again. I don’t know what to do because it feels like i lost such an important part of myself."
Unstable relationships are still better than none,24,mgzq67,10,"As of right now I'm crushed by the fact I have no one around me. No friend to casually talk to, about my life or theirs. I barely see my parents because they equal negative feelings and just breakdowns over the same things. My only casual human interaction at this point is putting up a couple posts about my interests and live of the few interactions I get like a starved man planning how to split this one can of food over a month. 

I've seen plenty people on here talk about how being alone has significantly helped them but, as much as I myself prefer to keep my circle small, no circle at all is just downright depressing. At leats along with the sad, you have the happy sometimes. I'm almost always suicidal and it's only a matter of time before one of breakdowns gets bad to the point I end up doing it. Then I'll die with no one having cared for me. My funeral would be just the people who made me this way and traumatized me to the point of no function. 

When I post this, no one will reply. Call this wallowing in my own pity, but I'm not exactly wrong. No one in real life will acknowledge my existence anymore, but the countless times of being ignored online where I've just sought for aid with the same chances as any other stranger on here is another kind of soul crushing. I basically don't exist anymore. If this were a game, I'm a plain NPC with no voice lines or interactions, that's all."
Any advice on making a first therapy appointment.,2,mhe5mo,0,"Years ago I started to see a therapist for major depressive disorder after a breakdown. After several months of therapy I was diagnosed with BPD traits and was referred over to a DBT therapist. I immediately took a dislike to the DBT therapist and decided that I was done with the therapy bs and branched out on my own. Since then I haven't been doing horrible but lately I've been slipping back into old ruts and want to give therapy another try.

I found a place in my town that looks like it would be ok but I have no idea how to actually make the appointment and that terrifies me. What do I tell them? What do they ask? I know that you should go into therapy with a goal in mind but the only thing I can think of is ""I want to stop feeling like crap"".

Any advice?"
Can someone just... validate this/me lol,2,mhdfam,3,Can someone else please tell me about times they knew they needed to set boundaries/express their needs to their partner but you were too scared because you felt like it was going to make them leave/they were going to call you manipulative? I need some courage to express some things that are really hurting to my partner and I’m really scared but also hurting a lot because of it lol.
Adhd meds make me feel crazy.. help?,2,mhcsud,3,"Hey all, I just started DBT for my BPD, but I've also been medicating with Vyvanse to keep school and life in check. I find the Vyvanse gives me some serious panic attacks, almost psychosis, with bad anger outbursts. I want to treat my ADHD but I don't know if it's worth it with these medications. I also have Social Anxiety, which makes my relationship and trust issues so much worse. 

Help!!"
Does it feel worse before it’s gets better?,6,mh46ry,7,"I’m 25, been diagnosed since I was 19 but have definitely struggled immensely as long as I can remember. I’m starting to lose hope in my progress.   
I’ve been working really hard on getting better even though I recently lost my job and gone through a lot of trauma. I still want to get better to prove that can’t stop me. I’m also very tired of being “too much” for other people, and my emotions are absolutely debilitating over the smallest thing that other people don’t flinch at.   
So far, I’ve gotten better at controlling my behaviour and not reacting on my emotions. But I’m worried I’m just bottling it up. I don’t know where the line is. I feel like I am making myself smaller for other peoples’ comfort while still dying on the inside.   
I’m just wondering if this is normal, will the internal hell of an emotional rollercoaster get better with changed behaviour? I’m also trying so hard to challenge my thoughts but it’s extremely hard. I mostly just have to wait for it to subside but the pain is always somewhat there.   
It’s hard when your overthinking and bad thoughts have been proven to be right so many times.   

Thank you for listening."
i dont know what to do anymore (tw suicide),10,mh2his,6,"all i do in life is run away and burn bridges. Nothing ever felt truly mine, or worth having. I got so close to happiness for the first time in my life, as in, about to have everything I’ve ever wanted, but it all went south again. People closest to me dont believe in me anymore. The only person ive ever loved chose someone else after letting me believe otherwise. I remember wanting to die when i was not yet on medication - it was peaceful. Now i can actually feel the pain i will cause others by dying while also feeling my own shitty pain all the time. I dont believe i can handle being alive in the long term. How do you go on when life has proven time and time again that no matter what i do i will always end up at the same empty place again?"
Feeling grey - 24F,4,mh7fsh,2,"I honestly don't know where to start. I've never been officially diagnosed, but I've thought of possible reasons for feeling this way - depression, bipolar disorder II and finally this. Everything makes more sense now. As a kid I've always thought that my family is the unluckiest family in the world because I'm in it. Because they have me. Because I am me and not anyone else. That most of my friendships start great early on and then slowly become worse. That I've never had stable relationships. I have a hard time trusting anyone fully, even if they have the best of interests. And as much as I don't want to fully blame it on my upbringing, I think I have to give my parents some of that. They weren't totally abusive, but I felt emotionally neglected as a kid. My dad is basically hot and cold. One moment he would be aggressively angry at me (over something I did that angered him), and then suddenly he becomes this nice saint like creature treating me ever so kindly. So kindly I almost forgot what ever happened before. But I never forget. And then he would apologize. It was like two different personalities. And the cycle continues. It felt like walking on seashells whenever he is around. My mom on the other hand, would disregard my feelings, even though I am right and have a point. She would half heartedly apologize if it was her wrong. And she doesn't want to acknowledge negative feelings even though they are real. Always masking them with some fake positivity. I guess that made me who I am today. But even though they are responsible for my trauma, I am responsible for my own healing. Its just that right now and for several years now - my emotions are a wreck. I can be crying, be so so sad and then to happy and cheerful in just a few hours sometimes. Last year, I've thought about actually ending it three times. And its usually on an impulse. But I've never done it because there were things holding me back in the last minute. I am afraid when this happens.  And I really want to get help. But I can't bring myself to it. 
Right now I'm feeling grey. It is a colourful world indeed, but I can't seem to see it right now.."
Is anyone else very protective of their possessions or area they have?,55,mgtce8,19,"I feel like the things I own are very important to me and I very much dislike someone moving these things. I have a specific place I put each of my things and routine sometimes for example, I keep my wallet, keys, phone in one area that I place them when I get home, if anyone is to move them or use them without my permission my mind gets frantic and usually leads to angry outbursts shamefully. I feel like I have had this issue as far back as I can remember, but now I have children and I cannot have ""my own area"" or always place my things systematically, it's not fun, it leads to a great deal of stress. I really need my own ""safe space"" if you will, just an area that I know will not be disturbed and I can change to my will, I feel so petty asking my wife to not touch certain things of mine, it just causes a lot of distress and I wish it wasn't the case, she does not understand where I'm coming from though on the issue. Thanks for listening everyone.

Edit: someone in the comments mentioned it as a control thing, I really feel that's a good explanation. Maybe others will agree."
DAE get physical sensations or feelings they just can't put into words?,8,mh2ilm,4,"Hey. 

I'm hoping there's someone else out there that feels like this because I find it really troubling. I first felt really anxious/bad when I was like 9/10. I distinctly remember the feeling 9f everything just all of a sudden feeling sad whilst I was out with my friends. I still can't put my finger on it, but it was like a physical and emotional shift and once it started I didn't know how to stop it. 

The feeling kept happening every year around a similar time (summer) or triggered by similar smells, sights etc. I noticed that I always felt this weird feeling and then I felt it again after I was sexually assaulted at 13, and again after an abusive relationship at 16. It's so difficult to describe but one day I just wake up in the summer and feel physically different, it's definitely a bad sensation. I'm now 24 and I just don't really know how to describe it to my therapist or anything. 

Sorry if reading this was absolute nonsense but I woke up feeling like this again today (it's sunny and the air smells like when I was a teenager), all I want to do is cry because I feel like it's coming back again. But I can't because I just feel so numb and strange. I'm sure I sound crazy, but I just feel like I'm shutting down."

I do digital art and I want to make a character with BPD and would like some tips!,0,mhfhil,1,"A few loved ones of mine have been diognosed with bpd so I was thinking of using bpd to make a more realistic character. 

I've read about some stuff but i doubt it's enough to really get someones feelings and way of thinking. If you don't mind could you tell me a bit about yourself and give me some tips on making a character that accurately shows bpd? Or any tips at all for making a realistic character.

Do you always experience symptoms of bpd, do you/how do you mask your symptoms and what do you think when doing so?

Sorry if this intrusive at all."
"I’m depressed, physically unwell with anxiety and occasionally fantasising about just disappearing magically, if only.",2,mhaj5y,2,"Went for a walk in the nearby countryside yesterday, I hadn’t been to that trail before and I’m glad I chose it because it was just lovely, peaceful scenery, by a river with nice falls. I love walking these kinds of places, just out past where the crowds of families go to walk it’s peaceful. Often when I’m out walking I find myself laughing out loud with pure joy at how breathtakingly lovely the place is. I had that experience yesterday. The walk and the fresh air calmed some of the physical anxiety symptoms that have been escalating in me for a couple of weeks. I could breathe easier, my heart wasn’t in overdrive after a little while walking. Yet I’ve still spent today mostly in bed, getting up for snacks and having to run to the toilet a few times because my IBS is 95% triggered by stress. Pretty similar to how I’ve been most days for the past while. 

Things to take the edge off are just that, they aren’t a magic cure. Weighted teddy also helps me feel less tension but I still am so physically unwell right now, I still can’t face cooking anything that takes more effort than turning on the oven, I still have a piles of dirty laundry in every room of my house. 

I’m facing 4 university assignments due in the next 2.5-3 weeks. It’s doable as long as I get a start on them this week and I don’t technically need to get a “good” grade, just to pass, but I’m scared and I can’t quite fully understand why because rationally, I’ve always managed at least good work, usually very good. I think this is what’s mostly triggering how unwell I am. 

I also feel desperately lonely. I’m living alone because it’s what makes the most sense for me and my situation. Living with family wasn’t appropriate and I didn’t want to live in a shared place with strangers, not feeling 100% secure of relying on others in order to maintain a sense of home. I have more space living alone a tiny bit further out but still very accessible from a major town for less rent than I could be paying on a shared place, so it makes sense that way but right now it kills social possibilities. I have the odd friend here and there but haven’t really ever been close to anyone outside of romantic interests. COVID has obviously shut down the possibility of just being around a group of people which was the majority of my social interaction, I don’t really have anyone to text or call with regularly right now. 

I don’t think most people really appreciate what it’s like to be coming from behind socially without this experience? I know I’m making the most appropriate choices for me personally but it might not look that way to someone who doesn’t know my whole picture. I come across as odd and a bit withdrawn, I often hear assumptions that I’m not interested in being friends with someone when it’s really the exact opposite, and I just want to be wanted for me. I really just have so many negative experiences that I don’t want to force myself onto people anymore. 

 I’m fed up of feeling so physically unwell with depression and anxiety. I seem have less energy than the typical person seems to have. I worked out that to work a typical job as well as taking care of themselves, their home, at a bare minimum they’d be awake and fully functioning for at least 13 hours a day, and many people manage even more than that. I’ve never had a chance to try to sustain that lifestyle but I typically don’t manage that kind of energy more than 50% of the time. I think it’d help having a more structured day and week though, so I’m hopeful for when I do professional placements as part of my course this time next year to get an understanding of how I can manage that. 

This probably wasn’t great to read, it’s definitely just a vent because I’m not feeling good at all but I’d be appreciative of any comments or anything, just to hear from another person."
What does resentment mean?,1,mhf0xw,2,"Not sure how reddit works, so please excuse any mistakes.

I’m a 17 y/o male and have recently become friends with a classmate who has BPD. Today he told me he “resented” me and that it was most likely because of his BPD. 

I will admit it hasn’t been a smooth relationship but we’ve havent fought before. He just has a really hard time respecting my boundaries and i’ve been really serious about him sticking to the boundaries we set.

[he told me he was feeling manic so maybe me asking him to stick to our boundaries was a trigger?]

at the moment, i’m finding it hard to understand the word “resentment”.

Does resentment mean something different in terms of BPD? if so is there anything i can do to help him? I won’t force him to be my friend if he doesn’t want to be, i’m just curious. 

thank you for reading"
Sociopathic traits alongside BPD,10,mh102h,3,"Can one have full blown BPD and traits of sociopathy? 
I feel no guilt or remorse- yet i can feel anxious about made up scenarios. 
I feel no empathy- unless its self pity. I can definitely get emotional about being suicidal but thats as far as it goes. 
I dont think im narcissistic because i have a very low/no self esteem. 
I know how to be and when to be charming. 
I do lie to get my way. 
I get a lot of intrusive thoughts, although never been diagnosed with ocd. I am interested however how it would feel to act on those thoughts. Id often get them while talking to anyone and there would be this accompanying feeling of: you only survived this encounter with me because i let you to. 
The only thing keeping me in my rails is simply fear of legal consequences."
Anger issues,3,mh6rx8,4,Could anyone explain why some people with bpd have severe anger issues? my friend is a quiet borderline and he doesn't act out but there's a lot of anger inside. he can identify himself with very violent people and I'm struggling to understand because parts of him are very kind.

Why am I so incompetent?,2,mh9abu,2,"I live with a friend in a 2 bed flat. When she is home everything works. I am able to get myself up, showered, dressed etc. I can eat 3 meals a day, hold down a job, do household chores.

All of this changes if I'm by myself. I can just about get myself to work but that is it. No eating. No cleaning. No showering. Rubbish everywhere. Dirty dishes everywhere. Even on my days off work I just sit there, doing nothing.

It's like I'm watching myself on the outside and screaming at myself to at least do something but I can't. It's been 7 days and I've got another 5 left. I spoke with my therapist and we agreed I should sort out the flat and start again but I just can't do it. Why am I like this? Why can I not function like I should?

My SO has already left for work and I am trying everything in my power not to believe that they hate me but my brain is choosing chaos this morning. I feel like I’m nothing, like what’s the point in even getting out of bed? I feel like I won’t be a real person until my SO gets home."
Can Anyone Recommend A Good BPD Therapist in the SF Bay Area?,0,mhdy9h,0,Hi Everyone. I am looking for a good BPD therapist recommendation from those of you who live in the area and have already been through this research phase. I am finding the process rather daunting. Thanks in advance!
I'm desperately scared of *not* having borderline,3,mh6cwm,7,"I keep coming across posts about people who aren't ""really"" BPD, and it worries me. For context, I'm self-diagnosed, with one therapist saying I have it (or maybe just entertaining me?) and one saying I don't. I picked up *I Hate You, Don't Leave Me* in a mental hospital a while back and it resonated with me, so I did my own research and thought I had it. It was immensely relieving to realize that other people feel the same things I do, and it became a part of my identity.

I got into a relationship four months ago with an amazing guy and it makes me feel so much better, so my borderline characteristics have waned. For some reason, instead of being relieved, I'm scared. Who am I without BPD? It scares me and makes me want to hurt myself any time I come across something that reminds me that I may not really be borderline and I don't know why it hurts me so badly. Advice is absolutely welcomed, I'm not sure what to do."
why do i only crave intimacy instead of a real relationship,1,mhdrzl,3,"i honestly have no clue if what i’m about to talk about has anything to do with BPD, but i don’t know where else to talk about this, & i’d like to know if anyone else ever feels this way. anyway, over some time, i’ve realized that it is very rare for me to catch feelings for anyone. & its even more rare for me to actually want a relationship with someone. regardless of that though, i still find myself obsessing over guys who are attractive/have good personalities BUT not because i want a relationship, but because i want some sort of intimacy with them. i like the attention, i like giving attention, i like the excitement of it, but i do not like commitment or treating them like a boyfriend. its kind of annoying that all my brain ever wants is intimacy instead of a true relationship, but i really don’t know why & would like to know if any of yall ever feel this way."
I need help,1,mhdrsx,0,"My fiancée has bi polar disorder and I’ve been the worst support for her over the last two years. We have been together for a little over six years and for the most part things have been wonderful. It’s when she gets set off that I’ve let her down. I let her triggers affect me and I haven’t listened or better yet paid attention or have done enough research until recently to realize how bad that is for her. I ended up making her think so much is her fault when it’s not. On the brink of losing her along with our two sons because she can’t take the bickering anymore. It’s every week at this point. Nothing is worth losing them over. I know I can be better to her with her needs now but I don’t know if it’s too late. I also have ptsd and depression and I’ve been so stupid and naive to her mental health needs. I love her and our family. Now after trying one day she still doesn’t know if things will be better and I don’t feel like I’ll ever get the chance to show her. I wrote this in hopes anybody has any advice, because I’ll take anything to keep her and my family."
I dont know whats wrong with me,8,mh1brw,4,I don’t really know what flair to put this under cause honestly its a mixture of everything. I’ve been having crazy intrusive thoughts lately of really disturbing things and it’s been affecting me whenever im out in public especially. Another thing is that I’ve been feeling so...detached from myself? I can’t explain the feeling anymore. Its like im aware of whats going on but at the same time im not. It happens at the most random times of the day and its the most strangest feeling ever. I honestly might just be crazy. i also just want to isolate myself from everybody so bad because of these things. i just want to sleep and never wake up
I’m so tired of BPD.,14,mgyp5r,6,"TW: SH/suicide

My boyfriend broke up with me because he could not deal with my episodes anymore and I don’t blame him. He was my last bit of support and he said he didn’t want to be responsible for someone else’s life because I am so suicidal. 

I went undiagnosed for years so I’m barely receiving treatment. I don’t know how to deal with BPD. I don’t know how to fix myself. I’ve sabotaged every good thing in my life. My boyfriend was my best friend and I lost him because I couldn’t fix myself in time. 

I’m tired of worrying if my feelings are real or not. I don’t know when I’m being dramatic anymore and even when I catch myself blowing things out of proportion it’s like once I’m in that episode I just can’t stop and nothing can calm me down. I’m so tired of not being able to control my SH or my suicidal thoughts. I’m tired of everything I say coming off as manipulative when I’m just trying to express what I’m feeling. I feel so out of control and alone. I’ve been trying for years to better myself and this breakup just pushed me down so hard. I wish I knew how to explain what I’m feeling because I feel like no one understands. 

I don’t feel deserving of love anymore, I don’t feel like I actually deserve anything good in my life. My feelings are so excruciating and they are usually always over something so minor. I feel like such a burden to anybody in my life. I wish I didn’t have BPD and I wish I could fix myself. I feel so hopeless now. I resent myself so much for not being able to fix myself. I’ve caused so much trouble in other people’s lives because I can’t get it together. I’m trying my best and it doesn’t feel like it’s enough. I just wish I didn’t exist at this point."
How to not obsess over symptoms?,1,mhcw9h,4,"I’m a classic quite BPD case, and i’ve managed to get all of my symptoms under control without a therapist ( no insurance). This took all of quarantine and a lot of self reflection to get to this point, but even seeing a list of all the symptoms ( or others) makes me spiral and think how am i gonna control this everyday. ( i.e stopping myself from wanting to lash outward, make purchases without making myself wait a day and see if i still want it, thinking in a bigger picture and consequences to impulses, etc) 

It’s a conscious effort, sometimes I get really tired and let it slip but i’m glad i can be aware of what i’m doing and stop it before it spirals and won’t take it for granted. I am wondering if anyone has some methods that help them remember you have it under control and you’re doing your best. Thank you in advance :-)"
"Back in the outskirts of my life, hurts worse than ever.",2,mh7v8t,1,"Hopefully this type of rant is allowed

Background:
About half a year ago I had this really good friend, you know how it goes. FP, I just wanna spend time with them, no matter what that time includes. She and I had slept together a couple times (she came onto me cuz I'm terrified of rejection so I never make the first move) but she made it clear she wanted nothing more than regular friendship afterwards. That was cool with me. I just wanted to be around her whenever our schedules and her mental health allowed.

Some things happened to me (TW: r*pe/assault) and I reached out to my FP for support while I processed it. She said she would be there for me. After a few days/week tops of her ""being there"" which only included me messaging her a few times (literally at most 3 messages a day, stuff like ""its in my head again"" ""i freaked out when someone hugged me."") She blocked me on everything.

I found out from a mutual friend that she did it to teach me not to blow her up. After two weeks of being blocked, she unblocked me, refused to talk about it, but wanted us to continue our friendship as normal. We hung out a couple times and it was cool. Just us chilling and watching tv, showing eachother memes. No problems.

I sent her a meme a day after out last hangout and she blocked me again. Found out from different mutuals that she posted in a vague status about how I was a manipulator by using my trauma to get close to her and force her into a relationship. She also blocked my best friend/her close friend because she knew my best friend would take my side.

Recent:
She unblocked me like 2 weeks ago. No friend requests or messages. But she isn't the type to unblock someone unless she has a reason (i.e. was teaching a lesson) and my paranoia has gotten so great over the past few months that i have distances myself from EVERYONE that i knew is or ever was friends with her. And with it being so close to April Fools I'm actually stressing she is going to try to talk to me as a joke. 

Now i'm not just diagnosed with bpd but also bipolar and her unblocking me triggered a bpd high which lead into a 2+ week (still going) bipolar manic episode which is heightening all of my bpd issues. Now i'm just trying to get some of these feelings out since i pushed all my close friends away.

Ty for listening."
FP cut me off again and my dad has cancer,2,mh7jdv,1,"My FP and I have had many ups and downs over the last year, you know how it is—the highs are high and the lows are low. 

Recently we got into another fight as a result of my mood swings and constant need for validation. He says the way I act is selfish. 

Through all the pain, however, I’ve still considered this person one of my best friends. I’ve opened up to them in ways I haven’t with anyone else. I cling to them and definitely see them as a support system. But now we’re in a phase of no contact and it’s tearing me apart. 

My dad was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and it’s really taking a toll on me. My parents are divorced and my mom lives in a different state and I’m an only child. I don’t have a close family support system. And now with my best friend cutting me off (they know about my dad’s sickness too) I feel so lost and alone. 

I’m just so sad. I feel hopeless. Any advice or support or words of encouragement are appreciated."
Psychologist is booked and I’m really going through it I had an outburst,1,mhcc0o,0,I’m going to be honest I’m drained still don’t even want to type it out I just want someone to talk to I called Kaiser because I wanted to see if it was possible for me to have a one time appointment with a different psychologist that has an available opening because I’m having a hard time she didn’t listen to me when I said my psychologist told me there isn’t anything available till May but I need someone to talk to NOW not in 2 months this week has been hell so far.
I feel like a horrible person.,1,mhc9es,0,"
First of all I want to state that I am 18 years old with a plethora of mental health issues. I currently have BED (Binge Eating Disorder), Clinical Depression, and BPD. Recently, I have started to realize of how horrible and toxic of a person I am. I have lost several friends because of my actions and because I don’t necessarily think before I speak. One instance that immediately comes to mind is that I lost a group of my friends because of a very bad mental breakdown I had with them over text and the words I said during that time. I told them all goodbye and just felt really defeated in that moment and then ten minutes later I have the campus police busting into my room and an officer with a hand on his gun while I was getting ready to try and sleep it off in just a long t shirt and underwear. I was immediately terrified because I am a black woman and all of my friends knew this and were black as well. The officer scared the hell out of me and I had to deal with this issue by myself. After the officer left, I immediately confronted my friends and asked them why they called the police without talking to me and checking on me first and how they even found the information of my school as we were internet friends only. They told me that I had no right to be angry at them and that I was triggering to them and they all just left me that same night and never talked to me again. I even reached out to them later and apologized for how I acted and they didn’t even care. I feel like a horrible person because of my BPD and I often speak or say things without thinking if it could offend someone and it causes me to lose friends often. What do I do? I feel horrible for how I acted in that situation and no one will hear me out on my apology."
Am I a bad friend,3,mh4p81,2,"I suffer from depression, anxiety and bpd recently I’ve been having a lot of suicidal thoughts lately and the only person that makes me feel better in any way no matter what is my best friend, i had been staying with her for a few days and then she told me I couldn’t stay there as it was too much for her to handle which I completely understand but it shook me a bit as she knows that being with her is the only way I’m going to get better because she’s all I want

We had a big fight about it and she told me she was relieved and happy when I couldn’t come over to stay which was extremely hurtful to me knowing that the one person that makes me feel happy and safe from harm was happy I couldn’t be with her 

I have reached out for support from emergency services, and specialist services nothing that will be able to help me for the next few weeks, but am I a bad friend for only wanting to be with my friend who is my FP and the fact that she isn’t willing to give me what I need to get out of this intense emotional stressful time, for me to be out of it in a week or so I had only been staying with her for 3 days and I had already felt a good impact on how I was feeling and she makes me feel like im this big bad bitch for wanting her 

And I’m not asking her to put how she’s feeling (and I know it’s not fair you don’t need to tell me that it is) put me above her for the rest of her life I’m asking for this one week that is extremely frustrating and extremely hurtful for me to feel like I have absolutely no one when I’ve put her above and beyond how I’m feeling no matter what because I know I can deal with it when she’s feeling better"
I can't decide if I should break up with my FP or not,1,mhbnvn,1,"She wants distance and isn't texting me much, which I did hurt her in the past so the logical side of me understands that maybe that's all she really wants, space to breathe. But the emotional side of me is assuming that she is just getting ready to break up with me (even though we still hang out once or twice a week) 
Our relationship was very codependent and we both agreed that in order for us to stay together we must gain some independence, but its hurting me a lot. I don't know if it would be better to stay in the relationship and try to build myself up at the same time or just bail and learn to be alone without her. I keep going back and forth based on her responses or mood that day, and its getting exhausting. I'm not sure what to do at all."
Giving Up,0,mhb0p7,0,"Guess who's homeless lol. For two months I've done everything but scream in people's faces to get help and now TODAY people are finally coming to help me? I told them to all fuck off it's too late man. I've been trying for two months. I didn't even want to leave but my roommate is so selfish that she made the decision for me even though she's been here about once a week for the past two months and her boyfriend has lived here rent free for three years. I wish I could be one of her friends who gives her rides or buys her things so she would actually be nice to me; but I don't. That's reserved for work friends or people who drive. Social services won't help, Realtors won't help, no one seems to really see that I'm about to fucking explode? I can't wait to be dead holy shit. You work SO HARD EVERY SINGLE DAY and life spits in your fucking face and pushes you in the dirt. I can only justify the acts that have been commited against me since I was a tiny baby as ultrasonic karma; my previous life was something so unspeakable I must be paying for eons. Why am I so eager to love and support everyone when they could give a flying fuck whether I'm alive or dead? I'm done waiting for other people I want to vomit."
Why are we cursed?,3,mh3wga,1,"I feel so alone. My husband recorded me during an argument (honestly been waiting for this to happen to me) and he said I changed my answer 3 times. I have horrible communication with him and usually shut down or give simple answers. My head is just empty when I feel like I’m on the “spot” and it doesn’t mean I don’t care or want to fix the situation. 

He feels since I’ve become aware of my BPD that I use it as a crutch and have only gotten worse. Therapy has been scarce because of covid but I am in it. He called me many names and told me that he has been abused emotionally and mentally and can’t go on. He resents and hates me. His words. 

I feel so...hurt. Lost. Confused. Betrayed. I was supposed to get back to work today (had surgery) and he told me to figure it out on my own. I can’t walk or drive. I had to tell my work I won’t be coming in and to go ahead and file short term disability. He plans on leaving me - at least temporarily.

This is my partner of 13 years. Guys I don’t know what to do anymore. His friend was right. I am a broken human and I just thought he was the one who would understand me the most. Turns out he needs the love more than I do.... and I’m just falling apart at the seams. I know it’s not for him to fix. I have to fix me. But I feel like I have ruined him and will never get US back 😭"
"Not panicked, not me.",1,mhau8h,2,"My best friend just casually mentioned on the phone that she's looking for new friends that share her interests and hobbies. Someone more active and can push her to be more active too. I'm disabled and can't be that active, and not coordinated enough to engage in her hobbies. She said outright ""I'm not replacing you,"" because she knows how I am and how this will make me feel. In spite of that, and even KNOWING that she's telling the truth, I still felt this awful sensation of falling. Whooshing in my ears. Eyes filling with tears. I couldn't hear her voice anymore over my own thoughts that I'm not good enough, I'm lazy, I drag others down with me, and she's going to find someone amazing that she'll love so much more and forget all about me. Obviously I can't share with her how bad that simple statement made me feel, because I don't want her to feel guilty for wanting to better herself or expressing that to me, but I had to tell somebody. Hi. Advice or kind words or anything you want to say is welcome."
Finding a therapist,1,mham8i,2,"I'm not sure if its just me, or if others have this issue, but I am really struggling to find a therapist. I have seen a few in the past and they just weren't challenging me or pushing me to where I needed to get to. I live in the US and there are plenty of therapists in my city, just not many who work with BPD. I haven't had a ""formal"" diagnosis but I have had 2 psychiatrists tell me I have all the traits and signs of BPD. 

&#x200B;

Any advice on how to find someone would be totally awesome!"
BPD has sabotaged all my relationships,6,mh0itd,1,"My gf and I broke up cause I’m so unstable, she admitted that she’s scared to be honest with her feelings cause she’s scared to overwhelm me and I’m always scared of her not being honest with her feelings. I also ruin things she was the last person in my life I can’t do this anymore I’m trapped in this cycle man. I begged for her not to leave like a baby I was so weak man."
Self destruction,4,mh28tx,3,"I have managed to wreck my life... And all because of undiagnosed, unmanaged BPD. I've been diagnosed with CPTSD in the past, and possibly bipolar. But I know bpd - my mother was a definite diagnosed NPD /BPD - and I tick all the boxes for the Quiet version. Only came to this realisation two months ago.

I had a massive nervous breakdown last year, and over the next few months saw it all so clearly. A lifetime of projections, blaming others, mirroring and unfair anger. My poor ex husband, who tried so hard with me, but in the end I caused so much damage, and ended it... And hurt him. The weight of my regret is insane. I miss him, his real warm kindness, the security I had with him, the safety and laughter... And even in this, I realise that I miss him - to a large extent - for what he gave me. And him too, as a person.

The weight of THAT selfishness is killing me. But it's real. I can't avoid it. I see it so clearly.

I'm deeply depressed. Having fucked up my career too, overestimating my capabilities and intelligence. 

The clarity and depression of this vision is horrendous. It burned out the emotions out of me, I can't cry anymore. 

I see my selfishness. Self obsession. Unmanaged emotions. Anxiety, dear, depression. Mirroring and emptiness inside. What is seen cannot be unseen... I am a hollow shell, and I feel like a liar. Always. Because I'm not genuine deep down. Not sharing myself. Because I'm disgusted and ashamed of what I am inside. I can't show that to people.

But that part of me is the real me. The inner child that was burned by trauma. I can't find the love for it, I can't love, laugh or cry anymore. That child feels dead.

I'm deeply suicidal. Selfish again. I know. But I just can't face my future with this knowledge... Just a body walking around, people thinking I'm nice but actually they are just seeing a reflection of their own goodness in me. I'm a fantastic mirror. But it hurts so bad. I'll NEVER have a free, full, genuine life they they do... It takes a massive effort of will to stop the envy, the despair. The despondency. 

Makes me sound like a victim. And yes, I am - massive victim mentality. To take the responsibility would be to stand up, and keep going through life helping &amp; giving others - even though I'm a hollow shell on the inside. However much it hurts. Other people see their reflection in me, and think I'm lovely... But they go home to families and I - to another night of pain, KNOWING that I reflected their goodness, it wasn't mine to give.

I don't know if I can do that. The pain is driving me crazy. The stress I'm under has wrecked my sleep, my personality and everything else.

I can't live like an empty mirror. It hurts. SO much. Is it my punishment for not taking responsibility earlier, when my life could still be fixed and healed?

I won't have the money for DBT now. I am a single woman, and my employment prospects are very poor (another story...) I've done a great job self destructing. 

Not long now until I have the courage to end it. After all that, I'm selfish and afraid of dying. The body wants to live."
Randomly profess your love to somebody even if it might ruin things,15,mgvvov,2,ya so as the title would suggest do you ever just confess your feelings to somebody out the blue and i don’t mean to your significant other or friends but to people who maybe you just started seeing or to somebody who is your friend but you make it weird and just admit you have feelings for them or to somebody you don’t know that well or to a casual fling? i just realized i’ve done it a few times before it’s erratic perhaps self sabotage to ruin the relationship n push them away but ya. anybody else?
Maybe I can help?,6,mh0wvh,0,"Hi. I'm a long time BPD specimen. I just found this sub and I'm excited to read all the stories and try to support everyone. I'm here to feel normalized and move forward in life being a fucking ""mental health stat"" while I grasp the whole fuckturd shit that has been my life. Love you all and thanks for having me. I haven't met another BPD person before.

((Serious question; does bpd make you not age?))"
DAE have bpd and also a parent with bpd?,3,mh314f,5,"My mom isn’t diagnosed and probably never will be. I was diagnosed in September and as I’ve learned and researched bpd I notice that my mom also has a lot of borderline traits. 

If you do also have a parent with bpd, if you’re comfortable answering, what is your relationship like? My relationship with my mom is very rocky. We are just starting to speak to each other again for the first time since October."
Book recommendations?,1,mh947g,0,"I heard great things about The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, so I had purchased it, read it, and loved it. He discusses some really great strategies that could definitely benefit someone dealing with BPD. Does anyone else have any other book recommendations that would be similar to this?"
I want to make the few people left in my life hate me TW: suicide/SH,22,mgrw05,8,"So that I can kill myself guilt free. I find myself becoming more and more resentful of these few people because I live only for their benefit, to spare them from the pain of hearing I'd died; of ""mourning"" someone who was never real, never really here, never a person, just a nonentity in tremendous mental pain every moment of every day. I'm almost 30 with nothing but regrets and scars to show for it, looking at my future is already like staring down the barrel of a shotgun, except the slug is in slow motion and will take decades more to reach my face. I keep having flashes of myself as an old man, dying slowly on cold bathroom tiles after a fall, with no one there to help me. That's the best I can hope for."
Splitting for the other party,3,mh2nlk,7,"Is splitting something that can reversed? My partner who has BPD has gone from a loving boyfriend to a stranger in the space of 2 hours. We live together most of the week, and he stores a lot of things and clothes at my place. I came home from work today to find them all gone, and everything I’ve ever given him in a neat little pile. He won’t return my messages or answer my calls. I’ve asked his family to call and check in with him, as I know he has a history of self harm, and they say he’s ok. He has a child who he loves so I think he’ll avoid hurting himself for that reason.
We were planning a future together. Things have been hard lately, for a few reasons, but we had an initial appointment tomorrow with a relationship counsellor. I don’t know what to do.  If I had some hope that he might just wake up one morning and not see me as an enemy, I think I could bear it. Does anyone have any advice? I love him."
I don’t want to learn to live with this illness I don’t want to live with it all together!!,35,mgp9y3,2,Having bpd is literally the worst thing that can happen to a human. To have your childhood stolen from you to then your future robbed from you it’s soul destroying. I crave inner peace. I pray for the day I’m not a shit bag an can end this suffering
anyone have negative reactions to weed?,23,mgrmq8,13,i smoke it every night but sometimes it just amplifies my bpd symptoms and i feel worse. does anyone else ever get this way? i overthink to the extreme and its always about my fp. every emotion is like its on steroids.
Introducing Me,4,mh0xmw,3,"I feel empty, out of control, powerless and angry a lot of the time I have mood swings. I have no real sense of self. I am emotionally driven. Other people are often frustrated and angry towards me but i don't understand why.

I fear abandonment, rejection, betrayal and domination by others. I am needy.

I have a history of unstable or abusive relationships. Sometimes i sell harm or or have suicidal thoughts, l make threats and behave badly. I am impulsive (binge eating reckless driving sex spending, substance misuse) lfeel guilty.

I have brief paranoid ideas or severe dissociative symptoms related to stress, l experience repeated crisis in my life.

Things I might believe about myself as all over the place. Iam bad, I am unlovable, I do not fit in, l am different, I cannot cope alone, I need someone to rely on, I deserve to be punished, nobody understands me.

It may be hard for you to believe, but living with this sickness is far more difficult then the pain it brings to you from my hurtful words. For you- you can escape. You can walk away from me at any moment. I am left there in my mind, left in this confusion I call my life. Introducing Me."
DAE feel like their mood state is dependent on whether/when someone texts you back?,112,mgfybn,13,"I keep getting trapped in this cycle of sending out a text hoping for a reply, but the entire time it’s out there I just think about it nonstop. I get really down on myself and feel that anxious edge. I’m so tired of my mood depending on something I have so little control over."
Does anyone else sometimes feel like having borderline is like this insane mash up of all the major psychiatric disorders?,67,mgj1dr,13,"We’re going to have (or appear to have) anything from substance abuse, eating disorders of all kinds, psychosis, narcissism, lack of focus, trauma, anxiety, depression, unstable moods, anger issues, self harm, social withdrawal, strange behavior... idk did I miss anything?

It’s like we have so many issues to confront. It’s so daunting sometimes, no matter how long you’ve known you’ve had this diagnosis. It’s fine, sometimes I find it kind of interesting, like insight into all these different ways of thinking and coping but it really can be like whack a mole sometimes. It’s so hard to predict how I will want to react to a new (genuinely) traumatic experience when they do unfortunately happen. 

And clinicians even sometimes really try to be like oh maybe it’s this instead... like no b**** as it turns out psychosis, even strong sensory hallucinations, are a part of borderline... I’ve been dealing with this since I was a child unfortunately and it comes during stress both good and bad. Or I can have a full blown eating disorder and then recover almost entirely because now it’s booze and SH or I just simply don’t need that particular defense mechanism anymore. It’s really disorienting but yes it it can still all be associated with this one, very complicated, disorder.

Borderline is a crazy beast sometimes.

For People Who Pick At Their Skin (Potential Solution),17,mgsfbz,7,"Hey there, so I have struggled with compulsive skin picking my entire life. I have tried a number of ways to stop myself, including gloves and clipping my nails extremely short. However, I think I have finally found a solution!

I decided to get a set of acrylic nails done just for cosmetic reasons. I love the way they look, and it's been part of my new self-care. As a very positive side-effect of this, the rounded edges of the nails prevent me from actually damaging my skin. Plus, I am super cautious about accidentally damaging something I spent a decent amount on.

I know this won't necessarily work for everyone. But, in case it helps even one person, I wanted to share this!"
DAE have a really hard time knowing when they're feelings are justified?,9,mgvsym,3,"i find myself feeling so disposable to friends to the point where i literally would rather not have any if the ones that i have are just going to pop in and out of my life whenever they need companionship or something that theyre not getting from someone else. i feel crazy for feeling this way and maybe like i'm splitting and i find it so hard to get an unbiased opinion too. i don't know when cutting someone off is actually warranted and when i'm just overreacting, it's so exhausting trying to convince myself that things are not a big deal when it feels like i let people treat me like garbage in subtle ways. can anyone relate? what do you guys do to get by?"

I cnt express how much “help” I’ve took, I’ve tried numerous amounts of medication which just give me side effects on top of everything I have to deal with. I have bin in therapy for 7 years now taken part in numerous courses, I’ve tried yoga medication, even gone down the hypnosis path, had past life regression, reiki, tried phycadelic drugs u name it I’ve tried it. I just have to face the fact that we all have to die of something and suicide is my destiny. I have a loving boyfriend a lovely home my outside life couldn’t be any more stable, it’s inside my body an mind which is Cahos I cnt cope anymore with the pain, sadness agitation it’s mental torture, I cnt live with the sexual abuse that happend in childhood, it’s not like depression where it comes an goes I’m literally suffering every second of everyday! Please god let me die please let this pain end I am begging, please I cnt take this no more, please please please please let me at peace I beg you!!!"
Do you find it difficult fitting in with society?,17,mgrxbv,6,I feel like I don't belong anywhere with anyone. I'm just a lone wolf. I can't take this much longer. I do feel different but not in a superiority complex way. I'm just hurting deep down. Plus I'm part of the LGBT so I feel even more ostracized. Do you as well?
Impulsivity strikes again,1,mh6j43,1,"I was upset with my boyfriend over something that was said (I honestly don't remember). A friend of mine was looking for an apartment and I told her I'd move in with her. We signed a lease, paid first months rent, all that jazz. 
The apartment is 3 hours away. I don't have a job. I filled out like 80 applications and have gotten 2 calls for interviews but no call back. 
I also don't want to move anymore. I was mad when I did what I did. 
My boyfriend and I have 3 kids together-- I was going to take them with, I don't want to go though. I don't know what to do.

I'm scared to talk to my friend about it, she's going through a break up and a lot of other things. 

Someone please help me. :("
New to meds / prozac,1,mh6bnj,2,"25/F, Hi everyone, hope you are doing okay. I was recently diagnosed with bpd/eupd and prescribed Quetiapine at first but because depression + anxiety is more of a problem I asked to try antidepressants so was prescribed Prozac Fluoxetine 20mg. Anyone here have BPD and taking prozac??,


 I'm very nervous to start taking them right now, like having a mini anxiety attack over it! I need a little push 


any positive stories/ helpful experiences please, thank you.. I just feel sad all the time, a deep sadness that never goes away, I get very bad days/episodes of depression and anxiety. I just want to feel happiness every day man. I want to start living my life."
Is there someone...,108,mgejm9,34,"...who really wanted to die bcs of the intensity of their (bad)feelings/emotions but on the other hand they're afraid to die so...

Is there someone who lives with bpd and can control their emotions or live with them without feeling like the only way to escape this bullshit is to kill themselves?

I feel like shit and I don't know how it will last. I'm too afraid of what s after that (not that I believe in God or smth but I have a strange belief that every variable is valid and it might happen and I m not sure which one is true). So I'm not killing myself just for the moment. But sometimes I think about dying like a normal thing... and today, during a meltdown I was sure that is the only way to escape this feelings is to simply die."
Will it ever get better?,5,mgwzrv,4,"I've been in therapy 3 times. Tried countless meds. Tried mindfulness, yoga, exercise, honestly whatever I thought could help. Things just feel worse every year. I'm at a point where I feel like it's okay for me to give up. There's no hope for me. I won't get into the details, but I really see no future for myself other than this suffering. 
Nothing brings me joy and I have nothing to hold on to. I don't even know why I'm making this post honestly. I guess I just have no one to tell. All my friends think I'm a joke."
"there's no winning, the outcomes are the same",1,mh5ly9,1,"sorry about this and feel free to completely ignore but i had to let it out somewhere. (TW: suicide is mentioned briefly) 

im so terribly scared to lose him to the point i want to push him away. if i stop talking to him then he cant get annoyed or bored of me and its impossible to say something wrong if im not saying anything. if i leave now then im hurting myself rather than letting him hurt me. im scared to say something wrong or to fuck something up and its stressing me out to the point i cant enjoy anything. i love him and i know he loves me too but my brain won't stop. one of the main reasons for wanting to end my life was so this wouldnt happen again but the whole reason i stuck around was because i found him. im so mad at myself for letting this happen. all my emotions are so uncontrollable when it comes to him, they make me feel physically ill and my insides hurt and i can feel my heart beat in every part of my body. all i do is ache. im scared im going to become so embedded in my own brain and thoughts that i will make him feel bad too and i don't want to hurt him. i cant figure out whether i should leave and risk hurting myself and him or whether i should stay and also risk hurting myself and him. theres no winning."
"I'm utterly numb, dissociated and empty.",13,mgsc4d,3,"Everything feels fake, unreal, distant. I'm watching myself going through the motions but I don't feel any connection to anything at all. It's just TV static in my head."
episodes with FP out of control,3,mgzpge,1,"everything they say cuts deep and it’s all true but hearing it at my low points starts my suicidal spiral, which in turn makes them more upset, which makes me more upset, which makes them more upset, which makes me literally lose my goddamn mind on the floor screaming under my breath, which makes them more upset, so on and so forth. 

i fucking hate my fucking self so much i don’t know what to do how do i stop this cycle i try so hard but i always fucking fail, they don’t deserve to have to deal with my garbage, please please help"
A psychiatrist validated me,10,mgstj5,1,"Earlier this year, a therapist told me she doesn’t believe that I have BPD ( I was diagnosed with it at another clinic ). Her invalidation made me feel awful and I questioned whether I really had BPD. But today I had an appointment with a psychiatrist who made me feel validated and that I wasn’t faking it like the other lady made me feel. So yay!"
can i believe my instincts?,2,mh185v,0,"friend and i were having few beers yesterday and after a while an aquaintance of ours showed up and he invited her over. soon her friend we dont know joined. it was cool. i was already tipsy. my friend had to go soon, but i stayed to finish my beer, and girl said shell make me company. it was cllosing time, so i soon drank it and we all got up to go. on the way out i said bye, but the girl i know was talking to someone else and didnt  pay attention, but other girl i just met hugged me.  
on my way home i was so disturbed and embarrased bc i felt like they didnt want to keep me company and i was burden and went offt he rails with destructive thoughts.   


i always trusted my instincts. when i felt a bit unwanted i would just go away forever, but lately i think my instincts are not correct hahah  
(im not in any kind of therapy atm, tho i put myself on waiting lists)"
Things are just weird,2,mh17ad,0,Idk man I’m in college and I’ve just been just totally fucking out of it recently. I feel so sad that I just abandon relationships. Fell hard for a girl but she’s taken and I still want to be friends with her but I don’t know how fuck me man. Things are so complex and complicated. I wish things were simpler.
Phone coaching,1,mh459q,3,"So I have started DBT. I’m a few weeks in, and phone coaching with your individual therapist is supposed to be included in the cost. It was very expensive to do but my individual therapist hasn’t given me a phone number. Should I ask? Is it beneficial to have this? Or is it not necessary. 
Thanks"
Begging my therapist to not terminate me,2,mh0xfi,1,"I had an incident with my therapist which I posted on this subreddit regarding her breaking confidentiality to my mother. I got angry and wrote an email saying I’ll see her one last time and go and see someone else (this new person has then expressed that I’m “too complex” for her to take on and now I’m left with no one) as she has broken my trust. I also made a complaint to the clinic about her. The clinic called me on Monday and said they were cancelling all my appointments with her and that I could not even see her one last time. After many times calling the clinic in tears they agreed for me to have a final session with my therapist but said she cannot offer ongoing sessions.

I’m really regretting what I have done. I have been seeing my therapist once a week for four years and to see all that go down the drain is heartbreaking. I really want to rekindle things and keep working with her. I have been feeling extremely depressed, barely eating, self harming and crying and calling helplines every day.

I have written her a letter I will give you to her in the final session (ai am no longer allowed to email her).

“Dear X,
I just wanted to write you a letter explaining the situation. I felt like we were reaching an impasse in our therapy so I reached out to another psychologist for advice. She said to work things out with you before switching over. My initial plan was to give us a few more sessions to work things out then see. However, I felt you forcing me to call my mother broke all my trust in you and I got angry and emailed you saying that I was going to see someone else. It turns out anyway this psychologist will not see me after all as my presentation in “too complex.” 

I really do regret sending you this email and I feel like I’ve jumped the gun too soon, which I tend to do with my bpd. It was a stupid and rude thing to do and I wholeheartedly apologise. The prospect of losing you has really put things into perspective for me. Even though we’re not friends and we’re not related, you’re one on the most important people in my life and I can’t picture not having you in it. These past few days have been filled with sadness and a lot of tears. I’m absolutely heartbroken.

We have made so much progress together and I think it would be extremely detrimental to my mental health if we were to cease therapy so abruptly. I really do want to continue working with you. I’ve been seeing you once a week for four years. Something like that shouldn’t be ruined based on a misunderstanding.

I am pleading you to give me a second chance. I really value our therapy more than anything. There are changes we can make to make this work such as: an updated safety plan and agreement, no email contact, permission to contact my mother if I am in danger and more.

Please work in with me to help make this work. I want to keep working with you more than anything. You have helped me grow so much and I don’t know where i wouldn’t be without you”

How does that sound. Is there anything I can add or change or do you just think it’s a hopeless cause?"
I can't stop ruminating over things said by my FP/SO during a fight,7,mgugkz,2,"We were fighting a lot last week, a lot of mean things were said on his part. We've made up since but honestly I feel like the things he said just destroyed me. Now I'm constantly worried that I'm making him mad when I'm around him and I feel fucking pathetic for caring so much in the first place. 

When I'm alone all I can think about is all of the flaws he pointed out. That I'm the saddest most depressing person to be around. That my issues are too much. He has more fun with the girls at work than with me. I have no friends and no interests and that makes me boring. 

I hate myself for loving him so much and I hate the way he sees me because of it. I feel like the only way he could love me is if I just ignored him and did whatever the fuck I wanted, maybe then he could see my value but probably not because nothing will change the fact that I'm fucking worthless and pathetic. I'm an empty, sad person, no depth just anger, sadness, and eagerness to please. I'm not a real person just a mirror for the people I love. 

I feel so broken, I just want to hide away and never speak to anyone again. If I had my own apartment I would just leave and cut everyone off so I didn't have to feel the weight of everyone's disappointment in me. 

I can't stand myself, I am in constant pain and suffering and all I have is love, drugs, and other dopamine rushes to anchor myself from one moment to next so I don't go insane or kill myself."
Do you ever feel like part of BPD is loving being mentally ill/“crazy”?,7,mguafj,3,"I always loved to feel like I was “crazy” as a kid. I made EFFORTS to be “crazy” and weird. Even now, 12 years into BPD treatment, I still get these feelings of like...I could be so crazy if I wanted to. I could go off the rails. And it feels so good to know that I have that inside me- which makes no sense because I love my life and my healing has given me what my illness never could. I am so happy and healthy. But every once in a while I feel like...I could be so dark. I could be like Harley Quinn. 

And to that end, I think a LOT of people with BPD (in this sub included) love to wallow. They love to feel like they’ll never get better. They love to self harm. They love to tell other people it’s normal and ok to use self harm as a coping mechanism. They keep repeating the lie that BPD is incurable. It just seems to me like some pwBPD find joy and pleasure in feeling like they’re “fucked up”. It makes me so sad. And yet...it’s such a familiar feeling."
how did you tell your s/o about your BPD?,6,mgw63s,10,"I’ve been posting here about my *chaotic* love life over the past few weeks. I haven’t told my current partner about my BPD, but he sees/rides out the roller coaster with me as best he can. He knows I struggle with anxiety and depression, but this is way bigger than that. I told my last partner abt my diagnosis over text, and I feel like I regret that. But maybe it’s the best way to do it. Maybe I send him some literature and we chat about it tomorrow IRL. But like, “borderline personality disorder” sounds insane. I’m terrified. Does anyone have any advice?"
How to create understanding of my illness without seeming like I blame bad behavior on it,6,mgtjtb,2,"I’d like to figure out how to have a conversation with my SO about BPD and what it does/is, to help him understand a little better. I don’t want to come across like I blame any bad behavior on my illness though. I know I’m responsible for my own actions in the end. 

Any advice is appreciated."
Was I also abusive?,1,mh35tf,3,"I’ve had a lot of terrible experience with narcissists in my life since childhood. 

I had a few instances of people I considered close, either romantically or as a close friend, abuse me. Whether it be mentally, physically or emotionally. The main factor that was common from each of these relationships were the fact that they wanted control over me. In any fashion, they’d try to have it over me and push me down to nothing. And gaslight me constantly so I would always be left questioning my sanity.

Throughout this time, I had undiagnosed BPD that was not assessed until 2018. I felt bad because I felt like I acted out in ways I didn’t expect. Getting EXTREMELY angry for being neglected on purpose, having anxiety attacks over being gaslighted constantly, having obsessive behaviors to prevent my partners from cheating on me (since they expressed interest in doing so), etc. I did EVERYTHING I could to salvage the relationships and still I was never good enough for my partners. I did what I thought was the right thing to do with good intentions and avoided being abandoned at the time.

I looked to others for romantic emotional comfort and I know that wasn’t the right thing to do at all. I never physically cheated on my partners but I always wished I could’ve left all those years and been with someone who loved me. I attached myself to strangers to try to find an escape from those abusive relationships to find any sense of validation. 

Of course now being older and under good therapy, I know those weren’t the best approaches to handle the relationships. I do my best to do the right thing day by day and be a good person.

Do these previous actions of mine make me abusive? Does this make me a narcissist? Or an abuser? 


And if so, how can I come to terms with this and move on?"
Can’t get over losing a friend over a year ago because I was a piece of shit,4,mgvoyh,2,"I think about it all the time. I’d never really had a friend I trusted nor a friend at all really and she was the first person to treat me like a person, we spoke every day, watched movies together, listened to music together and just had laughs, and I messed everything up. I’m a piece of shit and just genuinely want to hurt myself all the time because of it, I deserve it, I miss her so much and knowing I’ll never get to speak to her again hurts so much. I’ll always live with the regret of losing her for as long as I live. I miss you."
Frustration with having an attachment disorder as an adult.,8,mgrdtz,3,"My therapist has not like, officially diagnosed a particular disorder (I’m not sure there is one), but recently our sessions have been my frustrations with having an inability to attach to people. 

I mean, I’ve always been relatively friendless, even as a kid. Like I had one or two friends at a time, but I guess like, I could have fun with people sometimes, but I don’t care too much if they leave. Like I value the fact people provide distraction more than actual people. 

I don’t say that to be like “oh i hate people” or “i have no empathy”, because thats not true. I have and am capable of empathy, I have a very large capacity to care about people as a whole. But the moment we are equals I cannot attach. I can see someone as a mentor, or I can see them as someone I need to protect. But when it comes to being an equal, I cannot even maintain interest. 

My therapist and I have talked about it, and she says the only way to really combat it is to try EMDR to at least process trauma, but even then theres no guarantee I can ever form those attachment, it just depends on why the “block” is there. 

I say all this because the whole thing just makes me so fucking frustrated. Its so frustrating, because cognitively I see people doing this thing, having fun doing this thing, talking about this thing, but I cant ever fucking understand it. Like people talk about stuff about having partners and shit and its just so frustrating. Like I don’t understand why I can’t feel or understand this fucking basic human experience. 

I always knew something was missing, I guess. Like I knew I wasn’t experiencing the same thing everyone else was. I just had no idea how to explain it. So I guess like, its nice to know *why* I’ve never “gotten people”, but its frustrating that no matter how cognitively I can recognize and understand the problem, I cant fix it. Its just fucking there and it may never be here. It makes me mad that no one picked up on symptoms of RAD and emotional neglect when I was a kid. Like maybe if the therapists could have been like, “oh yeah this 10 yr old is fucking bullshitting me because she cant trust me”, maybe I could have fucking learned. 

Like how did all these therapists and doctors and teachers not realize how distrustful and sensitive and closed off I was. Why wasn’t I taken away from my home? I was a fucking kid, I didn’t know it wasn’t normal. Why was it my responsibility to know and explain there was an issue? I was a fucking kid, why did anyone trust what I was fucking saying? 

Idk, if you read this, thank you, its a mess. Just kind of word vomit till I see my therapist tomorrow. Its like, I know I can be happy despite this. Theres workarounds. Ik objectively its not the worst thing to have. Im just kinda pissed about it rn, y’know? Lol. I’ll be over it in like, 10 minutes."
Starting therapy today!,13,mgoia9,2,"That’s about it, I’m just excited! I’ve been to a therapist a few different times, but not since I was diagnosed with BPD and grasped that I had it. I’ve been wanting to go to therapy for a long time, and I start today! I have a lot of work to do lol"
I honestly can’t take this pain anymore,13,mgml8o,5,"I wish I could express how I truly feel, everyday is torture! Living with bpd is just a curse. I’m so so so tired of fighting this never ending battle, I’m exhausted and I just crave peace. I cnt take the pain and the sadness a day longer. People make suicide look so easy I get so jealous when I read someone has died by suicide. Every second of everyday is just unbearable I don’t no how I’ve made it this far. I want to die so so so so much I don’t think anyone realised how much tho. Please can someone end this miserly for me I’m beggingggggggg"
Need help with BPD essay.,3,mguc9d,1,"Hey guys! Bit of a weird question here, but I have a 10 page paper due for one of my classes as a final. It has to be a research essay about anything we’d like. I’d really like to write about BPD as I already know a lot about it and it’s very interesting to me (cuz I have it lol). I’m having a hard time developing a good thesis statement/argument to center my essay around though. Any suggestions would be appreciated!"
Does anyone else get the birthday blues?,22,mgia4y,4,"Today is my birthday. I have been incredibly emotional and in my feelings all day. This isn’t the first time this has happened. It happens every year, every birthday. So much so, that I don’t generally celebrate my birthday on the day. My friends force me out to have fun before or after. But the day is generally quite melancholy."
I fear judgement and it all stems from the abuse I have experienced from my parents,3,mgtqjg,1,"I'm sitting here wondering if posting this is a good idea, nobody in my family knows about me having a reddit account so but I still fear them finding it. I'm sitting in my room tonight by myself and today is my step sisters birthday. My dad and step mom (who is so shitty to me) took my step sister out for her birthday, didn't even invite me, after letting her travel around some states and having a beach trip. I never was offered that and I'm his blood. he is taking shots with her, hes never done that with me. He wouldn't drink with me. most of the times when we would in public he would ask did I need to eat that, why wont I look at the salads. Yeah I put on a lot of weight I wont lie, the thing is I did not get to choose what major I did because he was paying for my college degree so I was miserable and starting smoking pot then eating to feel good. I haven't smoked weed in a long time and im trying to fight my weight due to my liver started having issues. I just cried and feel like shit. I was just raised so differently than she was because she is the favorite because shes hot basically.  I remember that I wanted a nose ring and when I asked he told me if I did that he would rip the nose ring out of my nose, she just randomly went and got one and everything was fine. This has happen many of times. I love her but shes such a shitty person overall and its her mothers fault because she allowed her to do whatever she wanted because my dad wouldn't let me. It's such a long painful ass story but trust me it was done on purpose. I'm not perfect, not even close but I have never done what she has done to people and yet everything is okay when she does it. makes no fucking sense at all. The only enjoyment I have is knowing my dad is fucking the secretary at work and my step mom does not know. It's so funny because she's the dirty whore my dad was fucking when he was with my mom. Thanks for reading I guess."
It's my Birthday! Turning 30 feels like a bucket of cold water. You guys get the NEED for validation right now. Can you cheer up a BPD 30 y/o woman?,14,mgkhih,16,"As the title says. Today I'm turning 30 years old and I am freaking out. I feel like I lost my twenties and a chunk of my teens to depression and anxiety, before and after I got diagnosed. BPD has taken a huge part of my life, so I am feeling old and failed today.
Any words of wisdom from fellow sufferers?"
Advise on helping my mom,1,mh0qzv,1,"My mom is undiagnosed BP. She has all the symptoms and hits almost all the DSM markers. She and my uncle suffered extreme physical abuse at the hands of my grandfather while her sister was the golden child.
I am not here to berate, belittle or argue. We each have our own space in reddit and I respect this. I am here to ask a question and seek help.
I think my mom would benefit greatly from therapy. She has massive and sometine crippling anxiety. She sabotages relationships and even some of my grandchildren don't want to see her. She's my mom and this pains me so much. Is there a way I can convince her to at least try to see someone? I've tried to raise the subject with her but she says that there is nothing wrong with her so why would she go? She also regards psychology as a bogus profession. I'd like a strategy but don't want to be manipulative about it. I also want to stress that I'm not looking to ""cure"" or ""fix"" her. I just think she would be happier if she saw a therapist.
Thank you for your time reading this."
Unhappy And Feeling Overwhelmed,2,mgxgrc,4,"You ever realize you’re just not happy. Yeah, you’re surviving. You’re living. Have a job. Lover. A few friends. But you’re not happy. Nothing makes you happy anymore. You look at old pictures of when you use to be happy and your stomach churns. Your mind spirals into a never ending loop of “what the fuck happened to me.”"
I held a man as he died exactly 1 year after my dad died,25,mggn3f,2,"When I was 12 my father died in tragic circumstances, he was stabbed to death  It was 2010. I'll make up a date. 26th August for instance

When I was 13, on the 26th of August I was walking to school when I saw a man collapse. I was alone, I ran to him and uses the raised road blocks as leverage to get him on his back. I put my arms around his shoulders. He'd cut his head. He tried to speak to me, he looked me In the eye and died.

I fainted, then called an ambulance. I found a man jogging who helped me and put his arm around me and walked me to school. I was in shock.

I was never explicitly traumatised by that mans death. I don't believe in destiny, but it was a very weird coincidence. 

I felt it was comforting. I couldn't be there for my fathers final moments, but I was there for this man."
Splitting from friends,4,mgsi6b,0,"Ive been splitting from my friends (BPD term that essentially means my brain wants to cut them off cuz why tf not) IDK wat to do aside from just avoid them and wait it out, the thing is I live with them so I am mostly just isolating and withering away cuz im too scared im gonna shout at them to shut the fuck up. Mostly ive just been getting increaingly agitated/ annoyed with them and like little stupid things that I feel like shouldn't matter but do, IDK how to effectively communicate that I need them to not interact with me right now cuz i hate their fucking guts, but like cute and wholesomely. I was also never taught how to set boundaries or communicate effectively and that is abundantly clear rn. Any advice or tips I apprreciate especially surrounding setting boundaries/ communicating how im feeling effectively. I also dont want to just say im not doing well and its not their fault and to ignore me because part of me feels like it is their fault/ I need to set a boundary that isnt dismissive of my own feelings."
Negativity doesn't change the situation,2,mgwdzq,1,"Okay, so I know that others come on here to vent during their struggles especially in those moments that it feels helpless. It always just really saddens me seeing people say they think bpd is a curse and they wont ever get better. Now, I have felt those ways before so I am not passing any judgement but I am also a firm believer that if you want things to get better you have to work for it. I am stuck in this limbo right now of waiting on getting into a DBT program and stuck with an uniformed therapist on bpd. Now me a few years ago would have thought this was pointless and this is ""proof"" that nothing will get better. I still am really struggling with those constant suicidal thoughts and outburts but I am finding those patterns where before I didn't. To get to this point of acceptance with little help has been hard but I have done my best with what I have. Bought several workbooks, watched Dr Fox videos on youtube, and communicated to my loved ones what things trigger me. Obviously I can not fully heal on my own but I do think there are things that we can do to help ourselves and staying stuck in that negative mindset only feeds in to this disorder. I am not sure if what I am saying makes sense but basically my point is that you have to work hard to get better and it sucks I understand, trust me  I understand, but it is not impossible. There is a reason that a therapy was created just for people with bpd. We can live happy and normal lives and yes it is different than those with out but that does not mean that is a bad thing. I just really get hurt seeing others share on here that they feel like it never ends. Challenge your own thoughts, educate yourself on what to do, and you will get  better."
How to seem more normal?,5,mgqn4x,0,Confrontation and thinking for myself and how I feel is hard. Idk how to put it into words. When I’m confronted with something I go blank or think black and white thinking and have trouble having my own thoughts. How can I give a normal response?
What does BPD + BD look like?,0,mgze6g,2,"What does BPD look like in a person who also is diagnosed with Bipolar disorder (1 or 2)?

How does BPD interact with BD? How is DBT adjusted to address the BD, or are there a combination of therapies?

I haven’t yet understood how these two disorders coexist. I would love to understand, to see what life is like through this lens and how therapy helps manage and improve the outlook for individuals with both disorders.

Curious to hear your input and experiences so please share!!"
"DAE feel ""fine"" going into therapy and episodic on an opposite schedule? OR, how to cope with feeling extremely emotional following a session?",2,mgvjo6,2,"I've been struggling with this lately a lot. I have huge, intense emotional breakdowns outside of therapy, but as soon as I get in front of the camera with her I'm mostly fine? Sometimes get emotional during a session, but therapy never coincides with when I'm actively in crisis. 

How do I...idk, not ""channel"" my crisis feelings into therapy, but even report them accurately? I sometimes can't even remember the depth of what I'm feeling after an episode, or what triggered it. How do I bring more of the things I REALLY need help with into a session? I've been trying to write out more in advance or while I'm having an episode, but sometimes I'm too emotional/out of control to even do that.

Also, today had a bit of a therapy breakthrough that I haven't had the time or space to properly process yet (had a family member in town staying with me and then had to go straight to work). Had a proper breakdown immediately after I was left alone and am struggling to keep it together at work now. This is the first time this has happened to me and idk what to do. How can I prepare for something like this in advance next time?"
Favorite Person Question?,1,mgz54k,0,"Hello all! I (21F) am not diagnosed bpd, however I do share a lot of symptoms and am working towards finding a diagnosis that fits me. I’m very new to this and I’m still working on researching the things I’m experiencing, so forgive me if I get some things wrong. 

One thing I have always related to with bpd is the idea of a favorite person. I often tend to tie myself to a person and my entire self worth and feelings depend on them. That connection happens hard and fast and feels obsessive and out of control at times. It happens most often with internet friends and has happened recently in a way that is a lot more intense than I’ve ever experienced, and I’m looking for advice on the situation but I feel judged by my therapist when the topic comes up and I don’t feel comfortable talking to her about it.

In the past year I met someone playing dnd who I quickly connected with, we became very close friends and it very, very quickly got into the territory of unhealthy dependence on them. I was constantly looking for their validation and attention, I hurt other relationships to keep that one working, and everything I felt was completely out of proportion when it came to them. A month or two ago I hit a very hard depressive episode and suddenly felt completely unconnected from them. I no longer need their validation or attention, it is a complete change that seemingly happened over night with no trigger, I have absolutely no clue what happened. I went from one emotional high to a low with no warning, and it seems to have really hurt our relationship.

He’s a great guy, but I think both of us are a little confused and unsure of how to proceed in a less codependent way. I want to be his friend but I don’t want to go back to him being the center of my world because it felt so obsessive. How can I get back to having this guy be my friend in a healthy and natural way? Anyone have experiences like this and can offer any guidance?

Again, sorry if I’m posting this in the wrong place or badly characterizing bpd, I’m working off of research and some therapy and I’m just not sure what I’m experiencing quite yet, but I know this is a fp issue and I’m hoping to get some advice about how to work on that relationship in a healthy way.

Riding out emotions,5,mgr1nz,5,"I’ve been sent some modules from my local mental health team about distress tolerance and they say to ride out the strong emotions rather than fight them which is what I usually do because I don’t want to feel my strong emotions because they make me feel like I’m going to die. Here’s the problem - I’m anxious today, very anxious. I’m trying to ride it out but it just keeps going. Does anyone know how I can do this? It feels impossible and it feels like it’s never going to end. I feel sick from the anxiety and I want it to stop but I’m trying to ride it out and it’s a mess. I keep telling myself “I’m anxious and that’s okay” trying to help myself except the feeling but idk I just feel stuck and anxious and this is horrible."
My (28f) mom just saw self harm scars on my arm by accident during a video call.,386,mfypd9,69,"She said ""what are those marks on your arm? Have you been cutting yourself like a 13 year old?""

When I was 13, with scars, she asked ""when will you grow up and act your age?""

To this day, she says I dress like a child, act like a child, etc. Now Im almost 29, still self-harm, and constantly struggle with feeling like a child trapped in an adult body. I'm really feeling hurt by how she acted, and angry too. I know I should just let it go, but it hurts.

BPD and Bipolar,1,mgy8ze,1,"I read a lot about them, and even attended a conference today, but I’m still uncertain about their differences... especially with type 2 bipolar disorder. What are your thoughts? I was never diagnosed with bipolar disorder by the way, only BPD. I’m just curious what draws the line."
Facing one's self,3,mgrcvz,5,"Over the years since being married, I have discovered things about myself that I would have ever known had I not fallen in love and taken a vow to do whatever I could to make my marriage work.  

I have done my very best.  It wasn't good enough to save what I wanted to save between my husband and I, partly my doing but also a lot of his doing as well.  It has taken me a long time to realize and TRY to accept that no matter what I could have done, there was still him with his own demons.  

I have tried to fight my own.  I have tried to heal my soul.  For him...  For me...  For us.   I wanted it bad.  Even if that meant looking at myself.  

Perhaps the change came too late, in fact I know it has.  I wish I knew then what I know now.  

This is the acceptance part I struggle with.  I have to accept it was too late.  I have to accept it wasn't all in my hands.  Sometimes, no matter what you do to change you, the circumstances remain.  You cannot change another human being.  You think that free will enables you to CHANGE your circumstances.  It's not that black and white.  You can only change you.

And during this marriage, as painful as it has been, I for once was stopped in my tracks.  This relationship has given me a gift, regardless of it's outcome.  It shown me, for the first time in 30 something years, who I was.  I have to look in the mirror and see myself.  

Do you know how hard that is? (I'm sure many of you do)  I gave up over 20 years of binge drinking.  My **ultimate** coping mechanism.  What does one do without alcohol as an escape?  I'm forced to FEEL.  I'm forced to sit with this pain, this reality every day.  I'm forced to for the VERY first time, learn another way to cope.  I'm forced to be social without getting hammered.  I'm forced to sit in my skin and not run away.  When all your vices are stripped from you, it leaves you raw and exposed.  That's where I am at now, hoping that this place I've found myself, is some sort of rebirth, being stripped bare with a chance to start anew.

Finally diagnosed,5,mgm3qo,0,"All these days I was sure I either had borderline personality disorder or Bi polar disorder after 8 years of living like this,I decided to go to counseling in Jan,was helpful but yesterday I went to a psychiatrist, I am now diagnosed with borderline personality disorder with bipolar type and dysthimia. So many suicide attempts,so many friends lost,so many relationships destroyed.I am on meds but I honestly still want to die because for 8 years I’ve lived like this and my aim was to kill myself and end this pain and if I lived I don’t know what id do in life"
How do you get over an ex fp?,1,mgwz5p,0,"TW: mentioned alcohol and sex 

Its been nearly a year since my last relationship ended. I was completely head over heels in love with someone for probably the first time in my life. Life was completely perfect and sadness seemed like a thing of the past. I knew things were too good to be true and could almost sense something wrong was about to happen. 

And then everything changed while I was sleeping one night. I couldn't believe how at one moment I looked my fp in the eye and we had such a sincere ""I love you"" moment, and the next morning I woke up to find out I had been cheated on. 

My mind kept telling me that somehow it was my fault. I still decided to stay in that relationship, begging my fp to not leave me. I caught them cheating on me 5 more times after that. Still I believed that somehow they are too good for me and I deserve this. I never had the courage to breakup. One afternoon I saw I was blocked on all socials and my fp had left me for the person they were cheating on me with. 

Its been a year and my mind tells me that ""you split on them. Its this freaking black and white thinking. You deserve to die alone"". I have drank beyond imagination in this last year. I have cried every single night before bed in this last year. I have gained 20 lbs and hate myself more than ever. I haven't done anything since I graduated. I have sexted with more random strangers than I can count. I have never been more desperate for a relationship in my life but I just am scared to get hurt again. 

I feel like this was one breakup I'll never get over and I will just die alone. I can't keep going on like this"
"Favorite person won’t text me, what do I do?",6,mgld13,2,"I’ve been talking to him for a month and a half and we’re not dating but I can say I’ve definitely fallen for him. He didn’t say anything but that he was mentally exhausted and ignoring everyone, what should I do??? I already sent him something saying that I’m looking forward to seeing him when he feels better, but aside from that I’m afraid to say anything. He won’t respond to me and it’s been two days. I’m so anxious about it and I think he’ll leave me for somebody who isn’t so insane. What should I do to calm myself???"
Is there anyone who made it back from this far down?,13,mgferq,5,"I’m further down than I ever have been. I don’t think I’ve ever hit rock bottom like I have recently. I have no one. My partner is even becoming a source of stress for me because of my inability to sleep. Everyone has been stripped out of my life and turned against me. I’ve lost friends, partners, parents, and all motivation to continue.

I told my partner today that I knew I was going to kill myself in a month or so if things didn’t improve. I know things won’t improve. They can’t possibly improve enough for this to be bearable. I haven’t slept a full night in I don’t know how long. I can’t find the motivation to do any of my coursework. My private life has been ripped out from under me and displayed for everyone to know. I don’t want to eat, I don’t want to shower, I don’t want to try. I can’t regulate my emotions at all anymore. I have no security, no privacy, and no stability. 

These days I’m either dissociated or extremely depressed (or both). Nothing is working. I’m going to therapy, I’m being vulnerable and trying to get better; I’m doing everything I should be. I have a partner who desperately wants to see me get better.

How do I tell him that I don’t think anyone has ever fallen as far down as I am and survived it..? I can’t give him false hope anymore. I’m going to die like this."
mom..,9,mghdjm,2,"If the title scared you too then you should understand this post. 
So me and my mom have an awful toxic off an on relationship. one day we are good one day we aren’t. one day she hates me and i’m so disrespectful, the next she loves me and wouldn’t be able to get anything done without me. The reason for this is we both have extremely terrible mental health. (BPD for both, anxiety, clinical depresssion it’s all there.) Sk communication doesn’t come easy for us. Over the years I’ve tried to better myself for the both of us and all it does is hurt me, so i’ve had to start bettering myself for just me. My biggest fear is turning out like her but lately i can’t stop seeing the resemblances. it’s like everything i’ve tried to run away from and every way i’ve tried to be better than her, i’ve become her. and that’s scary to me. does anyone have any advice? how do i maintain myself without letting her ruin me? how do i get past the gaslighting without feeling as if i’m insane, how do i get past the manipulation and not let it be me who’s getting all twisted. i need others stories of shitty mother’s who ruined them too bc i’m really at a loss rn and it doesn’t seem like i’m ever gonna win. just wanna hear some success and that for some, it gets better. maybe i even need to hear for some it doesn’t. idk what i need but this place felt like the right place to put it all out there. sorry this is kinda chaotic"
i feel toxic as hell,40,mg921y,7,"so i let my fp (who is also my significant other) know about my bpd a few weeks ago and they comforted me and said all the ""oh i love you so much it's okay inwon't ever leave you"" stuff.

just today they told me that when im mad i'm scary and that i direct my anger upon them, which i didn't know. they always ask for me to vent to them when i experience my moodswings, i wasn't aware that me venting about the situation was scaring them. 

they have real bad anxiety and told me that they are highly sensitive when people are angry around them, so they try to be nice to keep me from attacking them. i wasn't aware i was ""attacking"" them by being angry in our dms and ranting angrily about how everything is my fault?

anyway, just a few minutes ago i got into a really bad low and they just kept asking me what the cause was. i felt really bad and i didn't want to scare them so i told them to stop asking me about it. i did it simply, just a ""stop asking about it"" and they haven't texted me since and i have no clue why it's scaring me so much.

so now it's just making me feel so shit for not only being unable to express my emotions normally, but now i might accidentally scare the people i love? i feel so terrible. i just need to know if i'm toxic at all i guess. i'm scared to ask them for reassurance right now.

EDIT: i thought they went to bed! turns out theyre just ignoring me! i got a notification that they uplaoded a video on their YT channel. i tried to send a funny video but they never responded. whenever i try to apologize for my moodswings they tell me there's no need. i feel useless"
How go get diagnosed w/o good insurance,1,mgv9z7,0,"I post here a lot because I am pretty certain I have BPD, this isn't just based off self diagnosis, I've been told I have BPD traits by a psychiatrist. 

I really want to get officially diagnosed because I think it would just really validate my issues and I wouldn't feel like I'm just making it all up in my head. 

The problem is I do not have insurance, or rather, I have crappy public health insurance and can only see a select few mental health professionals and none of them are psychiatrists or specialize in personality disorders. They only offer psych evals ADHD and anxiety and depression. I've been treated for all three for almost 7 years and my life is still in a constant fucking downward spiral because none of these treatments have helped with my emotional instability and self destructive behavior. I'm so sick of the lack of resources for people with anyone but anxiety and depression. It's like everyone is willing to help and listen when it comes to those issues but anything else and you're on your own."
I am wasting all my energy on someone who's not giving me any of theirs,1,mgu1xu,1,"End of December I met this guy when I was at a really low point, we started 'seeing each other' and we would hang out a lot, the thing is he would always say he felt like I was just wanting to hang with him cause I was bored even though he was never making any plans with me I can actually recall only one time he arranged for us to hang. Anyways a few weeks ago we were only ever meeting up to fuck, I had a melt down, he met someone else and now we're just kinda a friends with benefits situation, but the thing is we never hang out anymore. He tells me that he enjoys our friendship and hanging out with me but I keep trying to arrange for us to meet up and he straight up just leaves me on seen. I asked him if he's busy today and he said yes, which fair enough he might be, I've asked what about tonight and if he just ignores me again I'm gonna stop talking to him until he can hit me up. I just need friends at the moment I get stuck in my house cause I have no money and transport, I'm starting a job next week which will give me something to do but I really don't understand what this guy wants. The last time we actually properly hung out was nearly 6 weeks ago and I really enjoy his company we get up to some fun shit."
Fp indirectly said they hated me,2,mgpiva,2,"My fp (they don't know that's what they are) was ranting today over a minor situation that occured in our friend group. They said something like ""thinking about it makes me hate everyone involved"", I was involved in this situation. For context, me and another friend accidentally messed up in a dnd session a few months ago. Even though I've apologized for it multiple times and they assured me I didn't do anything ""that bad"", I feel so awful. Hearing that just crushed me and I've been a wreck ever since. They said other things that hurt but that's what messed me up most. I'm just so exhausted over this.

Advice welcome"
"What do your breakdowns look like, and how have they changed or improved with treatment?",3,mgmemy,4,"I was recently diagnosed and am wondering what other people's breakdowns look like. For me, it starts out with crying. I then start screaming things like ""fuck you"" or ""I hate you"" or ""I hate myself"", punching walls, and eventually collapsing into a sobbing, hysterical heap on the floor and begging my partner not to go and not to break up with me. I used to cut during these breakdowns but don't anymore. I just feel such intense self-loathing and desperation, and I don't feel right/am exhausted and emotionally depleted for a few days afterwards.

I'm in therapy and am very gradually improving, but I still absolutely lose control when these breakdowns occur (usually about once or twice a month). What do yours look like and have they gotten easier to manage over time?"
How do you be “one of the boys?”,1,mgtnnz,1,"( i’m a sophomore in community college. I’m transferring to a university soon and don’t want to limit my friend options. ) My other gay friends can code switch super fast, but I’ve never been good at it. I used to have some straight friends (they moved away) but whenever they would introduce me to their other friends it would always fizzle out or they’d ignore me. They didn’t really have an interest in anything I said or getting to know me, but always claimed after that they thought I was cold or standoffish. This always makes an episode of obsession on how straight dudes act around each other which never helps. 

Girls and gays tell me i’m personable and (lol) charming so i’m not sure where the disconnect is with straight men. whenever i attempt to fit in its very obvious i’m just mimicking them and they also call me out as being a wanna be or “burnt”. I still have singular straight friends but put me in a group with them and I just freeze up since I never seem to win them over and maybe that’s my issue. 

Seeing dudes interact so easily and being funny, interesting, quirky etc without any effort makes me upset since it’s so hard for me. Can anyone relate? Any coping skills to not freeze and try too hard?"
not everyone is equipped for mental illness,283,mfuwp7,27,"when i was in the mental hospital. one thing that really stuck out to me was: 
 we know how we are. mental illness is horrible. painful both mentally and physically. and we have our group of people,whether they be friends or family,but the staff said “ not everyone is equipped to handle mental illness” 
so yeah basically find out the people who can “ deal “ with it. not take it personally. who will understand. and yeah. some ppl who haven’t been through shit will not be able to understand or fully grasp it. they might get overwhelmed by our repetitive bad actions. that doesn’t mean they don’t care. they just can’t handle it. and that’s totally okay. it’s not our fault and not theirs. 
figure out who you can go to when it comes to things like this <3 idk if any of this made sense"
hi,3,mgm6lh,0,"Hello everyone,

I am currently feeling very overwhelmed and not sure what to do or where to turn. This is my first post here in this reddit thread, so please forgive me if I did not tag this post appropriately. 

Everything here is going to be so jumbled because I can't really keep my thought running in a straight line.

I have been seeking therapy/medication for bpd, but I cannot afford the therapy costs or prescription costs and life is getting out of control. I feel like every single day that I am just going to completely lose my fucking mind. Every day, I feel farther and farther away from reality. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been so low for the last couple of weeks that I don't know if I'm going to make it back up. Sometimes, I just feel like I might be better off to just check out. I don't know what to even do anymore. My anxiety has been so bad that I feel like I can't even step outside of my house. Every time I think about it, it feels like my chest is going to collapse. I can't hold a job anymore. I've isolated myself from everyone that I care about besides my husband. I don't have any friends or any family that I can turn to. 

I feel so bad because my husband is so loving and cares so much, but I feel so toxic. He is such a blessing to me, and I feel so bad because sometimes its like a switch flips in my head and I can't control myself. I find my self being so snappy and angry with him for absolutely no reason. This all just feels so overwhelming. I don't know anymore.

  
Sorry, anyway, I guess I'll step out now. Thanks for listening Reddit."
Feeling of being a lost case,20,mgamu5,4,"Do anyone else feels like you a lost case and it will never be okay again?

I feel like I’m a lost case. Going now through my third depression in the last 5 years. I have 0 self confidence in myself atm not for a job not for dating or meeting a girl. It’s like I lost my whole personality. I used to be someone fun, people loved to be around me. Now i lost everything, i feel ashame of myself, would rather stay at home not going out, so i dont have to deal with the outside world. I’m asking myself how will I ever meet a girl, if I’m like that. Who will want a man like me. All these thoughts together brings me to be suicidal.

I’ve recently had two girls (one a former roommate one a current) basically form a vendetta against me and now I am alone in my own house.

I need her and I pushed her away again. All I can do is manifest and hope she comes back to me and loves me again.
“Coping” isn’t an option for me,4,mgh63j,3,"In order to “cope”, I would have to deem the things I find unacceptable to be acceptable. That’s just simply not possible for me. 

Really, I don’t think I belong here in this world. I’ll always feel out of place, and that’s just how it is. I like to think that perhaps I was put here as a punishment for something I did in a past life, or something like that- and maybe in the next life I’ll ascend to where I belong after the suffering I’ve endured here.  

My soul just simply does not belong here, I don’t like people and don’t find most relatable at all. Most are selfish beings that are looking only to boost their ego, and thrive off of what they can leech off of others. 

It’s just a very difficult world to live in these days and I’m ready to leave.

Fear of relationships,2,mgndao,0,"I seem to have always messed up any and all relationships. Be it family, friends or girlfriend. The way I am just drives everyone away.

I recently got out of inpatient and residential treatment a few months ago. I was there for 2 and a half months. An now I might be going back again. I kind of want to send her a message on social media, but I feel like a creep. I just do not feel worthy of talking to her. I hate myself.

I want to start working on this now before I fall into this rabbit hole a 3rd time,4,mgi2sh,0,"Hello Humans

I am a Male with quiet BPD

I just got out of a 3 year relationship the first 2 years went off rather well besides need constant validation of her love but the last year became rather rocky I hit a depression spout and me and my so/fp started getting distant 2 months before our break up she initiated a ""break"" for us to start working on ourselves I actually handled this rather well and we both agreed to to not see anyone or talk to anybody during this time. We lived together so I took the basement she took the downstairs and we acted like friends. It worked for a bit but then the insecurity started acting up. 

I started noticing her behavior changing drastically and she started being much more cold she had always been extremely honest and kind somthing I held very dear to our relationship as my ex before her was not which to put bluntly fucked me up and I opened up to her about that and she knew. I started snooping and things were not adding up like how she said she'd be at a particular friend's but on her snap map was somewhere completely else among other things. I confronted her and she acused me of being crazy and being insecure.

This led me to getting some therapy and really opening up to a psychologist about my past and feelings and getting diagnosed with BPD the behaviors with my girlfriend continued and it started to put me on the deep end I started getting obsessed with a thought pattern of she is seeing someone else to I am being crazy she is not the type of girl to do this she knows what happned to me she would never. After a month of this she decided to move out so we could have space so we could have more alone time and we would be putting more effort into seeing each other I thought that made sense.  After that she got more distant with the texting and I started texting more and more I was going fucking crazy to put it simply. 


I visited her one night at her new place and brought her a coffee and some house warming gifts and she asked me a really random question of ""was I akward when we first started daiting?"" I said what no? She said okay I then asked why have you been on dates she said of course not I then said you can tell me if this break has been to test the water with new men I just want to know because my ex did pretty much the same thing and she went off on me for comparing her to my ex and told me to leave


So I figure for my own sanity we should break up so I break up with her but then my brain is like bruh wtf did you just do so then I start trying to win her back dumb move so for a week I feel like shit I start feeling really bad because she told me I ruined her mental health for the last 2 months and just so much stuff.

I get suicidal and make an attempt really dumb it wasent just about her I had no job my grades in college we all fails my house was disgusting everything was just shit 


I survive my attempt end up in the psych ward we talk she says we can still make this relationship work but I really need to get some help I agree  

2 days later she's in a new relationship I feel like fucking trash but here is the kicker all my crazy snooping all my insecure shit I did after talking with a friend who knows this dude correlates with 100% that she was seeing this dude for the whole 2 months that this shit was going on

The psych ward really helped me understand my diagnosis and got me on some meds that help me tremendously I just got a really good job and have a good social network of friends

But relationships I lose my self everytime

My ex before this same thing happned she started seeing another dude and the warning signs fired off and I ignored them and it fucked me up and it happned again


I am absolutely terrified of another relationship and obviously I'm not going to get into one for a long time I'm still imaging my ex happy with this dude getting fucked by him and it sucks

But I wana know BPD people of reddit

How do grow attached to people over the course of years but are able to walk away when they start degrading you as a person.  A part of me knew what was happening but I couldint imagine walking away for a second

Skeptical of everyone,7,mgdevm,1,"I have trouble trusting the people who are closest to me. I immediately think they have bad intentions and want to hurt me emotionally.

 I have experienced too many times where people take advantage of how much that i genuinely care and love people. I eventually developed this terrible consensus with myself that I always need to have my guard up. 

When I tell people about my illness it is the one thing that really scares me. Especially when people start blaming things saying “oh it’s because of your BPD”. When I actually do have a legitimate reason to be upset. This is where it gets really tricky and frustrating because people will take advantage no matter what. No one I have told has been able to resist the urge to use it against me. 

I have learned to forgive people, since no one is perfect but I still deep down don’t trust anyone. Not even myself. Feels lonely."
Just diagnosed - jealousy over best friend’s new relationship - fear of abandonment,3,mgiqc1,1,"Hi all. I’ve just been diagnosed yesterday with BPD. There’s a long waiting list for therapy and in the meantime I’ve bought a DLT book. I’m just wondering if anyone has any good advice about what to do about my situation. My best friend (M) has recently entered into a relationship with an acquaintance (M). I cannot shake the feeling of jealousy that I’m getting. I’m terrified he won’t want to hang out with just me (M) anymore, he never messages me when he’s with him, I can’t shake the fear that I’m just going to end up losing him and being the butt of their jokes. This is probably completely illogical, but it feels so real to me. I want him to support me and be close to me, especially with this new diagnosis I am obviously not well, but I am terrified of pushing him further away and him getting annoyed or feeling that I’m too clingy.
I want to stay friends with him, I don’t want to have to cut him out, but this is making me have real bad urges to self harm and I’m scared of what I’m capable of doing.
Any advice would be gratefully appreciated.
Thanks x"
DAE get really bad around their period?,191,mftk18,30,"Tw for suicide mention

As a kid I would be prone to more sensitivity during it, but these last two years or so the violent downshift of my mood during that week is absolutely insane. 

Yesterday admist the stomach pain and dysphoria (added bonus of being trans ✌) I went slingshotting from feeling emotionally fine to having such heavy suicidal thoughts I impulsively posted about them where folks I personally know could see them, something I NEVER do. And it sucka extra because I was doing so good for a couple weeks, coping well with everything. 

I did see some studies on how symptoms can worsen with the influx of everything happening in your body, but goddamn this is already a week I really don't look forward to, why does it have to reinforce my shitty emotions and make them even worse :/

Editing to just say:  I'm very glad I made this thread because I truly thought the severe emotions was just typical mood swing period stuff and only today learned that it's considered a legit disorder. So thank you everyone for bringing it to light for me!"
Online friend,2,mgky4v,1,"So I have this online friend in another state (I'm in TX, she's in HI). We've been talking for 8 months now since we met on this app called Lyf which is like a social media for mental health. We seemed to have a lot in common so we hit it off quickly. She's diagnosed and treated for bipolar. When things are good, they're really good for both of us but the problem is we always fall off the same page pretty quickly. Everything will be good and then all of a sudden things change. She made a habit early on of withdrawing from difficult conversations which hurt me and I tried to work hard to improve our communication habits but she still does it even though she says she's working on it. Like if there's something she wants to talk about she'll be active in the convo, but if I want to talk about some issues in my life she just leaves me on read and responds days later sometimes. The first couple months were really bad for my mental health because our convos and nature of them constantly triggered me  so I started to talk to her every few weeks, then a handful of messages per day, then one message per day, and I still keep getting triggered by her. She refuses to phone/video chat so I'm not sure what to do anymore to get through to her and get us on the same page and STAY there. Because when things are good, they're great, but they just turn the other way often and it's frustrating. She's not abusive at all, she's a very positive and kind person and understanding of my BPD but she's not helping with her behavior and tendencies to withdraw or not put enough effort into our interactions. What should I do?"
"My sister (31y/o) has BPD, I was 12 y/o the first time she tried to ""get away from this world""",5,mgfiz1,4,"It has caused a lot of trauma. From the time I was 14 until I was 20, I took the bus for 7 hours to be with her every other weekend, so I could protect her from herself. Every time she called, I thought the worst. When I was 20, I cut the contact  with her, I could not live like this. She did not get better by me being there for her.

Now I am 24 years old, me and my sister talk for half a year, then she blocks me for the next half year and this has been the case for a long time. Every time I am at home, or with her in person, I find it difficult. I have to be careful about everything I say, even when I have thought out all the possible scenarios and then say something well planned, she finds a way to make what i said offencive. I'm completely devastated after two days of being around her.

It is not possible to bring things up, talk about problems, etc. I have tried that for many years and nothing works. 

I need help, how do I handle this / how do I do things right? I love her so much, but its so hard. Also if u have any tips on how to get her to make good economical choises, please also comment that.."
"He's hurt and jealous, and I can't give him what he needs. Should I just end it to save him from me.",3,mgh58c,2,"I'm diagnosed BPD he has no diagnosis so who knows. This is what I do know:

I can't be there for him like he needs. When he gets upset/angry I get scared. When I'm scared I stick to myself more. He wants me to cuddle him and hold him close through it. 

Dude really? You just punched the table. I'm not gonna hug you, I'm scared of you. 

I've tried explaining this to him and he still says I don't care. Why? I'm not physically their for him. It's a vicious circle all right.

On top of this I made a new friend and I think he feels threatened by him. Every time we talk he's leg shake goes through the rough. He asks what were talking about and just because it's something funny he has a cow.

And the cherry on top is when I ask him whats wrong he just tells me he's anxious or bothered by something but never what it is. I try to lead him to telling me but it's like pulling teeth. Eventually he tells me... when I'm at the end of my rope. And of course it just ends in a shouting match with him feeling like I don't care and me feeling defeated because I did my best. 

Idk what to do anymore. I'm getting tired of it. I'm never their for him apparently. I'm about to show him what me not being their is really like. Just cold shoulder the shit out of him. 

I've tried ending things with him but he always gets all ""I'll do better I love you, you're amazing"" 

I'm thinking of leaving the apartment one morning and crashing on someone's couch until he can find a place of his own. Let him take/do whatever he wants. Idk how much longer I can be the problem when I try my God damn hardest every day. Something has to give."
Does anyone here have an experience with DBT residential facilities?,2,mgjw09,3,"I am 21F from the UK and have had many types of therapy. Before my diagnosis I had counselling from the age of 11/12 and CBT. I then received my diagnosis of EUPD aged 18. I have tried DBT online with a therapist and have the workbooks however I feel that I just forget all the techniques etc once the session ends as it’s sort of “out of sight out of mind” . I’m at the point where I need to force myself to do the sessions and read the workbooks but because I have episodes so strong that cause me to continue to do the worst things when I’m in that mood it’s as if all my progress is erased.
I’m thinking that maybe being in some sort of residential facility will be my only option, as there I wouldn’t have the chance to give up and I’d have to complete the intense therapy in order for it to sink in. I haven’t been able to find that much information online on how to get a referral etc so if anyone has any advice or stories regarding these DBT residential facilities please could you share with me and I’d greatly appreciate it :)"
"Question for my fellow friends on birth control. Do you feel your mood is more ""stabilised"" while taking the pill?",3,mggqme,4,"I take the pill every day just like I'm suppose to except for the 7 days when I need to take the sugar pill but after about the 2nd or 3rd day off the pill I begin to spiral emotionally and I more often than not idolize suicide. 

I get so scared by my emotion instability during this time that I'll take my pill without taking the sugar pills for a few months at a time because I can't handle being suicidal every month for a few days. It impacts my career, my relationships and my mental health immensely.

I was wondering if anyone else experiences this?"
"I'm the common denominator, but I still feel like I was in the right. Was I the asshole?",2,mgilww,0,"Every single one of my ""best friendships"" that was cultivated throughout middle and high school has imploded in a dramatic fashion during our college years, and I am the common denominator. My sister cruelly pointed that out to me once when she was commenting on how she still had all her best friends from grade school whereas I had no friends left. I can't deny that is true, so what is wrong with me? What did I do wrong? It seems completely obvious (to me) that I was not the one at fault in either of these events - I absolutely could have handled them *better*, by having a proper discussion with my friends instead of splitting and cutting them off, but am I wrong for thinking what they did *really was* unforgivable? Even after years of therapy and self-reflection, I still feel like I was well within reason for not believing I could ever trust these people again.

\---

Freshman year of college, I flew back to my hometown to spend my birthday weekend with my three best friends from grade school. At a party, I had a threesome with one of my friends and her friend-with-benefits. We all seemed to enjoy ourselves, and the next morning we all laughed and teased each other about it at brunch. No indication that anything was wrong.

Later that same day, we were supposed to leave for a theme park but 2/3 of the friends (including the one I had slept with the night before) didn't show up. I texted them to ask where they were and they said they were at the FWB's house. I couldn't believe that they had ditched me on my birthday when *I* had been the one to fly up to see *them,* so I said they were no longer welcome to come and our friendship was over. I never got an explanation for why they decided to ditch me.

*Unrelated to the original event but worth noting: a few months later, I begin attending the same university as the friend I slept with. We have no contact between us, but have several mutual friends. When I am out of town one weekend, she attends a party hosted by one of my roommates then breaks into my room, steals clothes, smashes a mirror, and cuts my face out of a large canvas print I had of my sister and myself. I get the university's judicial affairs office involved (after the police refused to get involved) and am granted a no-contact order against her after I provide Snapchat screenshots where she admits to being the one who had done it. She is also required to give me a money order to cover the damages. Thankfully, we make it through the rest of college without ever encountering each other again.*

\---

Senior year, the remaining friend of the original friend group has had a baby. I have had an abortion. I fly up to visit her and the baby often, which involves a 5 hour flight and then a 2 hour drive. About half of the time, she will offer to make the 2 hour drive and meet me in \[major city\] so we can spend time there, but she never follows through on this. Something always comes up that prevents her from coming to the city, which means I always have to drive out to see her (after already *flying* out to see her) For one holiday weekend, I also have plans to visit other friends so I can't drive out to \[hometown\] -- I make it clear to her that I really need her to come to the city if we're going to be able to see each other this time.

30 minutes before she's supposed to arrive, she texts and says she's not coming after all because \[baby\] is sick. Probably a lie, but I don't know for sure, so instead of calling her out I say ""I am getting really tired of you flaking on me all the time"" to which she says ""My son is sick and I need to take care of him. I'm not like you, okay? I can't just kill my child"" (in reference to my abortion)

I tell her that was an incredibly low blow and she should be ashamed of herself. She says I didn't hesitate when it came to getting my abortion so I must be fine with it and she doesn't even understand why I'm so offended. We never speak again.

\---

Over the years (I'm 28 now) my assessment of these events has shifted. I used to believe wholly that I was the innocent victim and I felt completely justified in cutting them off. But the years passed - with no new significant friendships made, mental health declining, as I have become more uncertain of myself, more emotional, and more prone to overreaction - I have started to doubt that initial assessment.

"Psychiatrist cancelled today's appointment by automated email, with no further explanation or offer to reschedule",4,mgfnqg,1,"I'm so glad I'm not currently in the same mindset I was in when I made the appointment, because I was desperate, at my wit's end, had to gather all my courage to reach out for help.

This cancellation may have tipped me over the edge when I made the appt two days ago, but today it's just a minor annoyance.

And a mental note to make the next appt with a different doctor, because that shit is unprofessional."
My 'friends' don't want me as part of their group anymore but can't admit it so they string me along,2,mghrnh,3,"As lockdown is coming to an end and people are starting to make plans again I figured I'd try and be more sociable. I have a group of friends who I have majorly detached from because they would always make plans and not invite me or stand me up on the day. I've chilled out massively over the last couple of years but I used to be very emotional and let people know when they had upset me which scared them off.  Over lockdown they have been very keen to make plans with me. Wanting to book lots of festivals and events but I've held back from committing a lot because they always let me down. It's important to note that they're very good at pretending these big plans are happening and I'm invited but they never go ahead but the small plans they make happen and I'm never invited.

One of the people let it slip today that the group were all meeting up this weekend to hang out and it just made me feel like shit. Why pretend you want me to hang out with you? That you wanna do stuff with just me and them and not the whole group but when it comes down to it I'm the only one not invited. It's like I've been exiled but they're all too cowardly to admit it so they dangle the bait.


I said I hope they have a nice time and let me know of it happens again as it would be cool to come but no reply lol. They're just so self absorbed and toxic but I literally have no other friends to hang with, which is why I guess I'm hanging onto the friendship.

Just wish I had friends who wanted to hang out with me and thought I was great and appreciated me because I'm a good time gal!! Haha"
Headspace?,1,mgmbx0,2,"Hey guys!

I was listening to a podcast unrelated to anything mental health, and they mentioned the app ""Headspace"".

If I get upset to the point where self harm is literally the only thing I can do I’ll either punch my right leg above the knee until I can barely walk or I’ll scratch my arms up to the point *just* before the bleed. They never scar thankfully.

Me and my partner will be celebrating our 3 year anniversary this week!,446,mfkjmv,46,"During the process of getting diagnosed I kept getting told that people with BPD don't usually have long term, meaningful relationships. Every time I'd say I have a boyfriend (together for 6 months at that point), the professionals would be skeptical, almost like I've made him up, or they'd say I need to leave him until I get better so I don't hurt him while I heal.

Well today, 5 weeks away from finishing DBT, we're celebrating our 3 year anniversary this Thursday. We have huge plans for the future, later this year we're hoping to be moving in together full time. We talk about marriage and weddings and kids all the time, we pretend fight over our possible last names and what we're gonna name the kids. We talk about giving my bird the best life and our future adopted pets. I've never had such in-depth conversations with anyone else about kitchen and bathroom layouts, we spent months deciding which knife set to buy.

I've never had someone accept me as me but also celebrate and acknowledge the changes and progress I've made. He doesn't see me as old me vs new me, he sees me with better skills. Even with me being non-binary and getting a binder this year, he still sees me. When I find a new hobby or interest, he listens to me rant about it with a smile on his face. He even looks at all the pictures of frogs I show him and he hates frogs.

It is possible for people with BPD to have healthy and strong relationships.

Edited to add: If someone makes a happy post, please don't shit on it by derailing the conversation to the treatment of men in mental health. If you're tired of seeing women told stories, tell your own and contribute to the class instead of complaining about the lack of men's perspectives."
I'm lost,1,mgkgup,0,"Like honestly, I'm really lost. I have this close friend that I've been friends with for more or less 6 years. I know she probably has feelings for me that are going on for years but I'm not sure about myself? Of course I love her but I can't decide if it's more than platonically. I'm really fond of her, she makes me feel better, I want everything the best for her and she's the most beautiful person on the world to me but... There are also moments when I feel like it has to be just platonical. So I feel like I love her romantically and don't at the same time. It kind of seems like I'm scared of it and it might be my fear of abandonment acting out in the weirdest ways but idk, it's very confusing, I don't know how to work through problems like it and they come up way too often."
DAE go back and forth about “needing” therapy? Rambles about therapy,1,mgkfgd,1,"3/30/21 

I’m not in therapy at the moment. I haven’t been for about a year. The last time I was in therapy, I went consistently for eight months, and it helped a lot, but also left quite a bit to be desired. 

I’ve been feeling more depressed lately, and I don’t really know why. Ive been doing a lot of things right (exercising, journaling, etc.) but I still feel numb and sad a lot of the time. Also, my BPD symptoms have been harder to control lately. I know that on paper those are amazingly valid reasons to seek therapy. 

But then in some moments I feel better. I don’t technically struggle with day to day aspects of living. I can make it through a day and keep myself in check enough. DAE struggle with the idea of whether or not you really need therapy? 

If I was to go back to therapy, I would have to start over with a new therapist, which is scary to me. Having to explain everything else to a new person. Make sure everything is squared away with insurance. And I don’t want to do virtual sessions, I want to actually go to a therapist’s office, which is (understandably) hard to find right now. 

Also, I don’t really know what I want to get out of therapy this time around. When I went to therapy last time, there was a long list of pressing reasons why I was seeking out therapy, but now, my brain feels like a jumble whenever I think of my therapeutic goals. Can anyone else relate? If yes, what are you doing? Are you in therapy? 

My last therapist wasn’t very good in a lot of ways (literally late to every appointment, would spend sessions derailing on things that I didn’t think were particularly important, judgmental of BPD and didn’t have much experience counseling people with it) and so I’m honestly kind of nervous to try again. 

I found a therapist on psychology today that looks like everything I need in a therapist. She’s trained in DBT and actually teaches DBT skills groups. So I know she would be a better fit for me in that way. But I just don’t know if I really need therapy and should be seeking it.  

So yea. Does anyone else struggle with black and white thinking in regards to therapy? As in, one day you know you need it and the next you don’t know? What do you do about that? Are you in therapy?"

Anyone been arrested?,49,mfxics,22,"I was arrested when I was experiencing a really bad anger episode. Honestly I could not control myself and I had no idea at the time that I had bpd.

I’m at a loss in my life.,0,mgjjop,4,"I’ve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADD/ADHD. The past 6 months or so I’ve been suspicious that what’s going on in my head isn’t just that. I thought I might’ve been maniac depressive or just psychotic until I stumbled across this sub. Every test I take online suggests that I have severe BPD, I know these are online tests and not and actual medical professionals, but I feel like doctors and therapists always brush off what I’m trying to say and simply blame the symptoms on what I’ve already been diagnosed with. Reading through posts on here, I relate with many of y’all, but I feel like I have trained myself to try and see things more rationally, ignored the paranoid thoughts and so on. I can’t help the feeling of distrust and I often find myself hating my own best friends because I make up these things in my head, just to learn that they don’t have any harsh feelings towards me and they think everything is fine. I really don’t know what to think anymore. I don’t fit in with society, and I like it that way. But the thoughts of suicide are with me daily. I know I won’t ever act on them, but they’re there and I hate that fact. I’ve gone through spending sprees and then felt intense guilt afterwards only to do it again the next day. It’s a viscous cycle. I’m not sure what I’m looking for in this post, but all I know is I feel a little more crazy everyday, like I’m living life all in my head."
terrified of confrontation,29,mg0afu,7,"is anyone else like this? i am really scared of confrontation so most of the time i feel like i let people manipulate me and walk all over me in ways unless i finally split them to black but not really because i just know theyre manipulating me i am very much aware of it i just cant confront people about their shitty actions and if i do confront them my heart starts racing and i end up saying something along the lines of ""yeah nevermind forget it"" it sucks so fucking much

im assuming this is due to my fear of abandonment/rejection but im not sure because i think most people with bpd are able to confront people so idk"
Why can’t I change?,3,mgai7g,1,"(18 M) I recall being a happy child, I was outspoken, loud, smart, I used to do very well in school, was in the gifted program at my elementary school. So at first, it was very hard to piece together how I ended up being my present self. Today I see myself as the polar opposite of who I once was. I’m not happy, I don’t speak out, I'm very shy, and I haven’t attended school since October of last year. This is supposed to be my senior year, I’m supposed to be graduating in 2 months. Instead, I’m rotting away at home, playing video games and distancing myself as far away from reality, smoking weed till my neurons burn out. I used to work at a restaurant, used to be a food runner and dishwasher on the weekends, I would be a server night shifts during the week on occasion too. But I quit because it was all too much for me, most days I was scheduled to go in I would get pre-shift anxiety. Working the shifts wasn’t any better, I would constantly forget things told to me seconds before, unconsciously take food out to the wrong tables. The job itself wasn’t that terrible, probably the most organized restaurant I have ever worked at, I just wasn’t good at it anymore. Growing up my parents owned a Mexican restaurant, they sold it 2 weeks before quarantine back in March of last year. At a young age, I was expected to start helping out. If I wanted to buy something I’d have to pay for it with my own money. By 7th grade, I was fully responsible for buying my clothes and paid with my own money every time I went out with friends. Truthfully though I hated having to work and I always despised my parents for it.

  I would compare myself to other kids and I would envy them because their parents wouldn’t force them into child labor. They also had present parents, mine were always preoccupied with the restaurant. I grew up feeling like I wasn’t a priority, always put to the side. Things worsened for me when I had to move schools transitioning into middle school. In elementary, I was always really well-liked by my classmates and was buddy with everyone. In Middle school things were different. I didn’t know any of the kids I went to school with, I was always friendly to everyone but for some reason, these kids didn’t take a liking to me. For the first time, I was truly alone. My parents were never around, my brothers were teens doing their own thing, and my childhood friends were gone. I started becoming depressed but didn’t know it at the time. School which had always been fun for me wasn’t of interest anymore, I started throwing random fits with my parents out of lack of words. In 7th grade, once I had finally settled with the emo clique and knew what depression was I decided to confess to my mom how I felt. She was lecturing me because I wasn’t doing well in school. I tried giving my side but when I said I was depressed she cut me off, told me I had it easy, and had nothing to be depressed about. After that I learned to not come to my parents with any personal problems, they’d be too busy or simply wouldn’t understand. 

  Transitioning into high school I had a very positive mindset. It was gonna be a fresh start, and there would be way more classmates than in middle school, nearly impossible to not meet like-minded people. My close middle school friends I made were not going to attend the same school as me but that was okay, as I felt us drifting apart anyway. I was over my rebellious too cool for school phase, I was ready to do excellent in HS with college in mind. To great disappointment high school wasn’t much different than middle school, the kids didn’t dislike me but I still didn’t feel like a fit. I was attending a brand new high school, I was part of its first freshman year class. The environment was very new to me too, I’m Mexican grew up around other Mexicans and people of color. This school that I was attending was mostly white populated, and lots of the kids were somewhat wealthy. Competing for a high-class rank seemed pretty impossible. I’ve always humbly considered myself smart but in high school, there were kids to who I felt inferior. Even though we were in the same grade they were more knowledgeable, had gotten better schooling, and had involved parents. The idea of graduating with good grades and a high rank completely left my mind early on freshman year.  I was lucky enough to go to a concert that year which gifted me with some temporary older friends. I went out and partied with them a few times and I felt free, I felt like I belonged. Unfortunately, My party friends and I didn’t last cause I was uncomfortably attached and pushed them away, but hanging with these people made my wanderlust. I realized how unhappy I was and suddenly my school seemed insignificant to me. The school itself was built on a field in the middle of nowhere, most of the people were conservative, and the whole school was only made up of freshmen and sophomores. I remember feeling defeated and frustrated because I could not imagine living the life I was living for the next 4 years. There was no way to leave, my parents would have to approve of that and I was conditioned to not ask for help. It was also at this time that I started turning to hookups and mindless sex as a coping mechanism. I figure I used to do it cause it made me feel like I had some control over the choices made in my life and it provided validation from men. Even though I still struggle with this behavior now as an adult I see how unhinged and erratic this was, especially for my age at the time.

  Sophomore year by far was the most memorable of all my high school years. The new school year wasn’t terrible at all. I had gotten into Newspaper class and had my group of friends, I no longer felt like an outsider. That year I turned 16 and I was finally old enough to start applying for jobs other than my parents’ restaurant.  I got a job at Waffle House along with my best friend at the time. There I met a coworker with who I fell into limerence. Working at Waffle House on its own was not a pleasant experience but I had my best friend there and the boy I was in “love” with made it worth it. I decided to quit when my “lover” kept playing with my emotions, or what I perceived as that.

    Also by some strange coincidence, the school 
district decided to make a new boundary map for the upcoming Junior year. My neighborhood was no longer zoned to my current high school. Current attending students had the option to stay, and while the timing was a bit off, I still wanted to leave my current whereabouts. I saw the move as an opportunity to reinvent myself, meet new people, and start fresh. That transitioning Summer into Junior year I started smoking pot with another of my close friends. At first, I would only smoke socially but I loved the high, soon enough I started regularly smoking on my own. The cycle of never fitting in had repeated itself. My ex-friend group from my previous school cut me off after I left. I remember having a chat with my ex-best friend telling her I wish we would stay close but I knew after I left, our friendship wouldn’t last. Of course, that was just me being a pessimist, my friends thought I was permanently saying goodbye. I tried reaching out and fixing our friendship but the efforts weren’t reciprocated. I felt especially stupid when I tried again almost a year later, only to find out they had moved on. I was no longer a part of their lives, I was simply a ghost from the past.

  Things were finally starting to look up around the time my parents sold their restaurant. For years I had been pointing out how most of our family issues were rooted in the restaurant. And when they sold it, things were significantly better. I even saw myself building relationships with my parents. Rationally I was old enough to know they didn’t purposely neglect me growing up, I was still not completely healed but I was at peace. That peace continued for maybe 2-3 months after quarantine started, then things deteriorated quickly. 

  Back in June, I had a clinic check-up, because of covid the check-up was changed to an online virtual visit. To join the visit I was asked to download a specific app. This app, in particular, doesn’t mirror your face camera on the screen as the meeting is in progress, instead, it is flipped. As the meeting was going on and I was forced to look at my face, I started to become uncomfortable, something was off. As I watched my face in the camera I couldn’t help but to notice how droopy the right side of my face was, I tried tilting my head straight hoping maybe that would help but it did not. Afterward, it was clear something wasn’t normal. I remember being told as a kid my forehead sinks on one side, and now and then someone will make a comment asking why my face is the way it is. Strangely enough, when I look in the mirror or take a mirrored selfie I can’t see the asymmetry, it’s only there when I purposefully look for it or when I see an image of myself flipped, because of this I was never bothered by my appearance before. Once the asymmetry became noticeable to me then I started asking questions. Why do I look like this? What’s the cause behind this? Can this even be fixed? With the very limited info I had, I made various google searches. “Facial asymmetry” led me to “plagiocephaly”, which is a flat spot that forms on a baby’s head when they prefer sleeping on one side of their head too much. Treatment for this is simple, repositioning your baby’s head and have them wear a special helmet that helps their head gain proper shape. This search led me to a more severe version of plagiocephaly “craniosynostosis” this version of the flathead deformity is believed to be genetic. It happens when a baby’s skull sutures prematurely close before the brain fully develops. As the brain grows its grows in every direction except where the sutures already closed, forming a non-symmetrical head shape. Treatment for this requires surgery to relieve pressure in the baby’s head and correct its shape. It’s vital to know treatment for synostosis has to be done at an early age before the skull is fully developed, if not then the damage is permanent. I didn’t want to take an educated guess on which one I had so I decided to ask my mom for some clarity. She confirmed my suspicion, I indeed was born with craniosynostosis. When I asked why I wasn’t given the surgery I was told it was too risky too much potential for something to go wrong. Thing is... I researched the surgery and it's completely safe, complications during the surgery are very rare. When I was explaining the helmet method to my mom she said it was done on me. Yet, I’ve never seen any baby pictures, or have I heard anyone recall the time I wore a plastic helmet for 6 months. 

After finding out that big chunk of information, my relationship with my parents went back to being dead.  This whole situation just engraved the memories of being neglected even more. Not only was I lied to straight to my face but I had to make myself aware of my head deformity, my incompetent parents couldn’t even do that. It makes me question what else they’ve been keeping from me, synostosis is also linked to genetic syndromes, for all I know I could have one of those too. And what makes it worse is they’re completely oblivious to all the agony they’ve caused me. I’ve always wondered why I’ve never been able to seemingly fit in. I’ve always felt different from others, and in many ways I am, sometimes I feel completely alien. Thing is, I was never conditioned to think of myself as any different from anyone else. I wasn’t even fully aware I wasn’t symmetrical till I was 17, now I feel like some freak of nature. Before I was aware of my asymmetry I didn’t realize how many funny glances I get, Now when I’m out in public it’s very irritating. Also doesn’t help when you’re gay and your community is super shallow and materialistic. 

   One of my biggest fears is I’ll never know true love because of my appearance. Because of this, I gave this guy who was interested in me a shot, for some reason though I’m never attracted back to someone who has an initial interest in me. Right off the bat, I was the one who started rushing things, I asked him out after just a week of talking to each other, I said I love you first when I didn’t. I led him on, I was selfish, I did what others had done to me before because I wanted to feel desired and loved. I thought “maybe I don’t love him now but I can grow to love him.” Soon I realized that wasn’t going to be doable, I couldn’t force a feeling and my sexual cravings were too strong. I will admit to having a hypersexuality problem, I don’t know if these particular urges were because I wasn’t in love with my partner or because I’m a sex addict that can’t settle with just boning the same person all the time. 

  I have all these behaviors and coping mechanisms that I now realize are wrong. I’m completely aware of my self-sabotage and that I need therapy, I’m finally old enough to get the help on my own. I know everything I’m doing wrong and I understand my emotional self very well. So why is it so hard for me to change? Why can’t I break and unlearn all these bad habits? Why can’t I get in motion towards my betterment?"
Do people with bpd hide it?,1,mghxba,4,"I have bpd (according to my therapist and psychiatrist but I can't technically be officially diagnosed until I'm 18) and I'm very open about it. In fact, I talk about it quite a lot. The problem? I know that most people with disorders such as depression, anxiety etc don't talk about it and hide it. Now, I'm not saying that all those things are similar to bpd, I'm just saying that the thing about depression, for example, is that a lot of people say that real depressed people don't show it. So I'm asking this simple question, is the situation with bpd similar? I really don't want people to think I'm faking it because I talk about it."
This happens a LOT to me,20,mg1vir,4,"DAE switch back and forth between loving and being repulsed and disgusted by affection? Either from someone else or even myself. I'll have moments where I can be super sweet and show light affection to people or sometimes even be flirty but then I always get a mood swing where I'm just disgusted by the way I acted or stuff I said or how I felt. It's like I try and suppress it or something. I could never, and haven't, felt disgusted by these feelings towards my FP but with other people it tends to be VERY on and off.

How to deal with boredom in a healthy way?,29,mfyrix,8,"Hi everyone!

I was wondering how do you deal with boredom in a healthy way? I can't seem to enjoy anything right now and I am so bored. I have a lot to study on college but I am not able to.

"My boyfriend and I just had the worst fight of our relationship, and I am really struggling to know whether or not I am actually the toxic one here. I am so sad and really need help and insight.",7,mg7ylf,10,"Hi all. I'm extremely upset right now and my thoughts are all over the place and I can't stop crying, so I'm sorry if this is long/incoherent. He is 35 and I am 30.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (possibly ex now?) and I have been dating for 3 years and living together for 2.5 of those years. Our relationship has been very turbulent. I was diagnosed and have started going to therapy in the past few months, and I think I've gotten a lot better (though I'm far from perfect). The last month of our relationship has actually been pretty peaceful, with only a few minor conflicts, which is rare for us. He even said a few times that he could tell I was making progress.

.One of the things I'm hyper-triggered by is when he doesn't touch me like he normally does in certain situations. Every night, we watch TV together for a bit and he holds my hand/puts his arm on my leg or whatever else. On Thursday night, he wasn't responding to my touch at all (and was actually turning away from it) and I got a bit upset, but we got over it. Last night, the same thing happened, and I started feeling really anxious. We had friends over, and I had to go to the bathroom because I was starting to cry and sent him a text. It said ""Hey, this is probably irrational, but I'm worried you're upset with me or something is wrong because you're not touching me."" He responded that nothing was wrong, and that sometimes he just didn't feel like touching. I came back and he still wouldn't interact with me physically, which only heightened it more.

We had an argument about it before going to sleep and a long conversation about it this morning, where I said I would try not to be anxious if he didn't want to touch, but I also expressed that that kind of physical affection is important to me. We had a normal day, and then we sat down to watch TV. He held my hand for a bit (limply) and then took his hand away. I immediately felt anxious and sad. I kind of pushed my legs into him and said ""do you not want to touch?"", and he put his face in his hands and groaned. I asked if he was upset and he said he was, and that he felt like I was tracking every one of his minor movements. We started having an argument. He said that I got angry at him when he moved away and that that wasn't right. I said ""no, you got angry and frustrated at ME for feeling anxious"", and this somehow set him off. He cursed and stormed off upstairs and slammed the door and locked it. I followed him up and asked him through the door why he had gotten so upset and stormed off and if we could keep talking. He started loudly playing his guitar over me and ignoring me. I kept talking (I was saying things like, ""why am I not allowed to tell you that you also get angry in arguments without you storming off?""), and he eventually started yelling go away, leave me alone, I'm so sick of this shit, etc etc. I began to cry and begged him to come talk to me.

He yelled through the door that if I continued talking he would break up with me. Through my tears, I said this was extremely unfair and that I felt like he was trying to silence and control me by threatening that. He kept yelling it through the door, and I finally, sobbing, left and went back downstairs.

An hour later, he comes down and ignores me. I said ""cool, so we're just going to not speak to each other now?"" He said ""Quit this passive aggressive bullshit, you're just making things worse and there's no reason for it."" I said ""you're the one ignoring me when you walk right by me."" He ignored this and went back upstairs.

I felt incredibly angry at this point and followed him upstairs again. I told him I wasn't going to just be in a situation where my partner is giving me the silent treatment, and I said I wanted to resolve it rather than just letting things continue to suck (my voice was raised when I said this). He said that I was bothering him and he wanted to be left alone. I got even more worked up and said that I deserved to know whether we were breaking up or if we were going to resolve this. We started yelling at each other, with him yelling at me to leave him alone and saying I was being emotionally manipulative. I yelled that he had been being incredibly cruel to me and I didn't deserve it. I said he was a massive prick. He said that he was so sick of me, that he didn't like being around me, and that his life could be ""great and fun"" without me making it ""shitty and difficult."" I yelled at him to just break up with me then, if I make his life so horrible. I then started sobbing and asking if he really didn't like being around me. He said yes. I continued to cry and asked why he'd then told me just a few days ago that he loved hanging out with me and I was his best friend? He refused to answer. I kept crying and questioning him and he finally said that he hated being around me when I acted like a petulant child (which, he said, was a lot of the time). 

It was around this point that I said through my sobs that he was being so cruel to me, and he basically said he wasn't, and then ignored me as I kept trying to talk to him. I then just... snapped. I slammed the door of the room we were in and screamed FUCK YOU as loud as I could, and he yelled back at me. I then said some really horrible things-- that his dreams were childish and he was never going to achieve them, that he was basically a teenager stuck in a grown man's body, etc. He said I was a ""bitter and nasty person"". 

About 5 minutes after, I felt horrible for what I said, and I told him I was so sorry and that I was just trying to hurt him because I felt hurt. He said he didn't care what I had to say. He went to go sleep in the other bedroom and said that I showed my true colors. I said that I needed to know whether or not this was over so I could book a plane ticket, and he refused to answer and kept telling me to go away. He finally yelled, ""I'm not answering because I don't know yet."" and that was that.

I don't know what to think. I know that it's completely unfair of me to get anxious about him not touching me as much as I wanted him to, and I am very sorry for that. But I feel like he was absolutely horrible to me-- so much so that I felt compelled to say the most horrible things I could think of to him.

I don't think there's any coming back from this, and I'm not sure there should be. We are great when we're happy, but we absolutely bring out the worst in each other, and I feel like he treats me really badly sometimes. Or am I seeing this the complete wrong way and I am actually the toxic one? I am so confused and BPD makes it really hard to see what's really going on. Any advice would be so appreciated. thank you."
It's my birthday today and I feel hopeless.,1,mggy4w,2,"I'm 30 today, and I'm feeling incredibly sad. I'm not where I want to be in my life and my mental health has only gotten worse, last year intensified it. 2020 was a shitshow with covid, personal family/life struggles and that's when my therapist said I show some characteristics of BPD. That all really put me in a dark place where I was suicidal for awhile..I am in a somewhat better place then last year, but that's due to therapy, and a group dbt course I started taking a few months ago. I'm on a new medication and it's still kicking in, it's only been 2 weeks but I haven't noticed a change yet besides sleepiness. It's after 2 ineffective attempts with other medications. It's been years since I've been TRULY happy and I am feeling so hopeless. I feel flawed and unloved, and I fear age 30 is just going to be another year of unhappiness and struggle."
DAE experience cyclical mood changes?,15,mg2e4m,2,"So I've been tracking my mood with apps and I realized I'll have a few good days, I'll feel optimistic and then I'll have a sharp decline in mood. It's like day and night. When I'm down I'm extremely down. Splitting on my partner, suicidal thoughts, deep depression, pushing people away, even splitting on friends, not wanting to go out and staying in bed etc. And i can't figure out what causes it. Sometimes i can link it to a certain event but usually in my better days i would be able to handle an event like that. So even though throughout the day my moods shift fast as well it isnt as intense as this. Does anyone else experience this? Its like 2 steps forward one step back every time."

I’m so frustrated with my brain for choosing out of everyone to rely on and depend all my emotions to, to be someone who is abusive and emotionally manipulates me into not leaving. I wanted him to my “my person” so badly. So so badly and it’s so overwhelmingly heartbreaking that he ended up like this. This has to be my fault. I must have did something to deserve this.

DAE experience “catastrophising” and does it sound like a part of BPD?,11,mg2wx8,3,"I’m from the UK and I have a diagnosis of EUPD. I’ve struggled for a very long time, but the past year I’ve noticed I have very severe anxiety. 

I get extremely paranoid, think everyone is out to get me (e.g. ‘expose’ me, like leaking an old conversation where I’ve called my friend a dick when upset), and every situation I do what my mum calls “catastrophising” - where I think the worst, such as breaking the speed limit once, thinking I’m going to get my driving licence revoked, then I’ll lose my job etc... I basically can’t think logically and rationally about situations. 

I’m just wondering if anyone else experiences this kind of behaviour? I know EUPD encompasses a lot of different emotions, and I’ve always struggled with anxiety to a degree, but what I suffer with currently is like nothing I’ve ever felt before. It was triggered after a crime was committed against me, which leads me to think maybe it’s specifically trauma induced and is separate to BPD... but it could just be another part of the illness that’s coming out to play... 

I know you guys aren’t doctors, but I would appreciate some insight as to whether this sounds like BPD behaviour or not. Thanks!"

Attention Seeking Behaviours,7,mg5opr,3,"When I’m overly emotional or have trouble regulating my emotions i tend to post a lot venting on my private snapchat stories. I’m worried this comes off as very attention seeking or maybe is unhealthy because it’s very much posted in the moment. I tend to use it as a coping mechanism because I want people to know I’m struggling but don’t know how to communicate it directly, posting on a story gives people the chance to reply if they wish rather than dumping all my emotions on one specific person.

I’m unsure what more experienced borderlines would have to say about this as its quite a new experience for me (6 months post diagnosis) and i’m struggling to know if this is something I need to self-regulate or not."

In too deep/,4,mg631k,3,"I (23F) feel like it's too late for me to get help, or heal.   
I spend my days off either in bed or trying to seek validation from people who I'm not even slightly connected to. 

I have waited so long to get help or even try taking a step back from the nonsense to truly get a grip on who I am or what I want/need in life. I know I'm only 23 and have my literal whole life ahead of me but in times of sadness and well, BPD, it's almost impossible to hold onto that.    
I don't have health insurance or anything but I did apply, it's just hard because I fucked a lot of things up for myself and it's hard to start over in your 20's, especially since COVID-19 happened."
Update!,10,mg16y1,3,"It's been a long and introspective few months. I dumped my long term boyfriend in November, I'd get jealous of him for hanging out with his friends, I'd yell at him for not texting me back immediately, and I'd accuse him of anything and everything wrong in my life. But I realize now that a lot of my resentment was self inflicted and I took out a lot of my problems on him, it wasn't fair to him and it wastn healthy for me either. I know that now in reality he really did love me and he was looking out for me by staying with me through all the shit I gave him. I wasn’t seeing straight at the time and I realize now that I really did love him too. No other guy has made me feel so content in my life. I've had lots of time alone to think about things and let out my emotions and I've even learned to love myself in the process. Spending time alone has been a very healing experience for me. Thank you to those who have helped me realize the benefits of therapy and treatment. BPD is a bitch but Im so happy to say we're back together now and I wanted to share this story as inspiration for those who have been hurt or have hurt someone Make sure to get help whenever you find yourself idealizing and devaluing in relationships and stay with the people that love you ❤️"
ADHD meds and BPD?,4,mg670r,3,"I know ADHD and BPD are often diagnosed together and share many of the same symptoms (especially emotion dysregulation and impulsivity), and I have both ADHD and BPD as well. 

I was wondering if anyone else has found ADHD meds to be effective for BPD? I’ve been taking Dexedrine/Adderall for a couple years and I noticed a huge improvement in a lot of my symptoms. The biggest change I noticed when I first started Dexedrine was a drastic reduction in my feelings of constant extreme guilt/shame for just existing. I would excessively ruminate over past social interactions, and it felt like all the bad things people have ever said to me were just constantly looping in my head in the background. I felt like an evil, unlovable monster because I couldn’t escape the hurricane of thoughts in my mind. But Dexedrine essentially eradicated this rumination, which in turn helped the guilt immensely. 

That being said, I still have many of the same BPD symptoms as before (especially emotion dysregulation), but I have a better self-image and don’t have that constant stream of negative thoughts looping in my head 24/7. And I also got addicted to Dexedrine/Adderall buttttt we don’t talk about that part. 

I’m curious if anyone else with BPD (whether or not you also have ADHD) has found ADHD meds to be helpful?"

I am getting better slowly,2,mgcdwv,0,"About a year ago: Met My current SO. I put him through all the Borderline ""tests"" If u will...I had many a freak out, I looked like a child out of control sometimes. I recall hardly letting him sleep sometimes, always threatening suicide, doing everything I could to sabotage myself and our relationship.

I used to try to hang myself frequently in the closet, and I choked myself a few times with different wires and things. I remember wanting to die very very badly. But my SO was the only beacon of sanity and normalcy in my life, so although I did everything you're never supposed to do in a relationship besides cheating or trying to hurt my SO, I did what I could to warn him about my condition and  myself, gave him all the advice I could including telling  him to leave me. He didn't. He's a bit codependent, and I admit he deserves so much better.

 This was the first time in a while that I had no stable home, I was fighting many ppl and had ruined a couple of my friendships leaving me in some very shitty situations including being right back in the home I grew up in with my father who has always been abusive. My father creeped on both of my older sisters when they were young, but he never did anything to me, so I still call him dad, but obviously that is always in the back of my mind now.

My dad started dating a lady shortly after my mom left him, and she HAS to be borderline, because she physically tries to fight just about anyone and everyone, drinks alcohol daily, and has been abusive to my dad. Most people don't realize this but, my Dad was abusive to my mother and almost killed her a few times, he even ran her over with a truck by accident once. Now: get ready for the ultimate example of karma. My dad meets this lady, and she turns the tides onto him. She dominates the relationship, once she kicked him in the throat. And get this: She ran him over in the exact same spot that my dad ran over my mom. Same road, same area, same drunken accident. The result of this was his bladder had burst, and my dad was in the hospital for awhile. Anyways: My dad still lives in the house we grew up in with Him and my mom, except now he has this new lady that is equally as crazy, and they have two kids together. Both are growing rapidly.

SO, while I was staying there it was like a flashback to my childhood, in almost every way, except my mother was a nice person. I got to live with them for awhile, and one night Stepmom gets hammered and starts screaming at me down the stairs, basically calling me a slut and accusing me of wanting to sit on my dad's lap etc. It was fucking scary and my mental health had never been so terrible. I was smoking a lot of cigs.

Needless to say, during this time in my life and, don't be fooled: this was not the half of the chaos...I was very very suicidal and at the end of my rope. 

My SO saved my life, and showed me what love really means. He and I didn't have our own place so we were literally living in his truck some nights, and his family hated me so I lived with them for a little while but that quickly turned into a nightmare because I'm 100 percent sure his brother, 30 yrs of age is a narcissist. I'm not just throwing that word around either, he has the full blown disorder, so we clashed to say the least and he kicked me out. So, it was ridiculous. I still haven't fully processed the whole thing, It makes me extremely uncomfortable to think about all the things that happened. Sometimes I swear I have the worst luck, but I know I brought it all on myself in some way.

FFWD a year later and here we are today, the amount of episodes I have are very slim. I haven't tried to kill myself nearly as actively or aggressively. I have gone off of anti-depressants and feel better. Still have sleep issues, still have episodes, just not as bad. 

Were living in a different town, and this side of my SO""s family basically just minds their business and is NORMAL. So I haven't dealt with any family fueds, and I am living with my SO in a stable home. Things are good, and though I still have my episodes, I truly think things are much better inside of me. I don't feel like I want to die anymore, and my relationship is a lot less toxic.

I know I'm a piece of human garbo sometimes, but I also don't believe everything is all my fault. I can take responsibility for the things I've done, But i also just don't believe in good and bad, black and white. I think everything has a bit of good and a good of bad. So I have come to appreciate my illness to some extent, and I have learned from the things I've done to some degree. I think I am getting better, I feel like I can do it  and I feel like anyone reading this can do it too, we can all get better and do better and be better, whatever that means. I would have made this post a lot longer but I don't know if people give a shit to read it all so I just wanted to make it as short as possible. THnx for reading folks.

Help with getting over an ex,7,mg34lg,5,"Hello! Im a 19 year old F and I recently got diagnosed with BPD. Right now I am struggling to get over an ex bf/FP.

It was my worst one yet and I feel really guilty for what I did. Long story short he now has a new girlfriend. This was so hard for me to come to terms with.

"I’m slipping, and I’m out of resources",3,mg6net,2,"Hi all

I’m a 25F quiet borderliner with a history of depression, anxiety and some undiagnosed reproductive issues. 

I’ve completed the Emotional Regulation unit of DBT about 2 years ago, recently trying EMDR. My current meds are 50mg sertraline and 10mg amitriptyline daily. 

These days, I’m struggling to get through a day without a fit of tears, a panic attack or thinking of suicide. My emotional regulation has gotten really poor and it’s impacting my relationship and my ability to work. 
I’ve had really poor memory of my childhood, along with some repressed memories from my more manic days that are starting to creep back in. The worst of these has been coming to grips with a sexual assault and all the things that memory beings with it. 

Normally at this point I’d be self-harming, but I’m in a stable and healthy relationship (!!!) and I know my partner would be so upset if I started again. 

I feel like I’m just drifting through life waiting to die, and I’m out of resources to try pull me out. 
I can’t lean on my partner or family anymore as they’re exhausted. It’s hard to find DBT in my city (and the only affordable/group option I found really triggering) and I’m also struggling with some physical health issues that heavily impact my mental health. 

I feel like I’m out of options - I’m doing all the things the doctors have been drilling into me for years but it’s not working.

Seeking any advice on how to pull myself up, please"
How can I do self therapy? Are there any specific methods to help with my symptoms?,1,mgbmw7,4,"How does self-therapy work for an undiagnosed person? Background story included.

Hi! I'm a 21 male in SoCal currently going to community college. I want to be a journalist or PR agent :-)

**Backstory** 

 I was bullied in high school because I was ""attention-seeking"" and a "" drama queen"". Symptoms started to escalate after my sophomore year, where I felt everyone was gaslighting me and talking about me behind my back then saying I was there but I couldn't post them on social media or tell people we were hanging out. I felt insane and the symptoms just got worse (August 2015- June 2018).
 At the same time, my parents got divorced (2016) and my dad is an obsessive hover parent up until recently

 My mom is an "" if I do something nice for you then you owe me"" type of parent. I was never allowed to be excited about something because I should be ""humble"" and if I won second place she would say I should have gotten first.  I would be upset after school, and get in trouble for ""bringing the mood down"" whenever I came home To this day I'm scared of going into my hometown because I might see someone I knew, or someone seeing me,. I avoid it at all costs and even run to my car since someone passed by my house to laugh at me the last time I was caught outside. 

 After I graduated I stayed in the local community college to be close to my brother who had a terminal illness and passed away that September. My mom spent the entire savings they had knowing this day would come on the man she had an affair with. I've been stuck at home ever since not allowed to move unless it's for a university.  Knowing I can't afford college without their help, I have to play the game and I'm near the end set to transfer in spring 2022!  (2018-present) 

As of recent ( December 2020), I talked to people who admitted they knew what they were doing. I realized I wasn't insane and my reactions were justified, but I can't really shake the symptoms that got me in that position, and find it harder to control my thoughts without maximum effort. My parents acknowledged they weren't trying to be understanding but what’s done is done and i’m just trying to get over it. In 2019 they both decided I was ""eating my check"" so they forced me into buying a used Nissan Sentra for $14k with a 12% Apr. My mom paid it off in its entirety this last month after admitting it was a ploy for me to use my money I had saved to not move away off impulse, and to increase her credit after her boyfriend left her bankrupt.

 My dad went along since he's obsessive and wanted me to at home. His ex-fiance lived with us for a year  (2019- August 2020) Every night mandatory dinner as a family, regardless if I had homework or had just come home from work. If I didn't eat they'd complain that I'm so bashful and shouldn't eat at all. They split and as of two months ago are back together, while she remains in her moms house. My dad doesn't like the idea of an empty house, so he has two strangers sharing the house with my 14-year-old sister and I.

 A therapist said  I show signs of BPD and trauma, and because of insurance changes, his focus on the payment mid-session, and his mood seemingly out the door as soon as he came to the conclusion that it may be BPD I didn't go back. Mental Health isn't part of my insurance plan, so any type of outside help in that regard isn't in the cards at the moment. I know a therapist isn't a psychologist, so I'm not sure where to start with self-therapy or even what books to read since I'm not sure what I would be trying to treat. I can list symptoms I normally have and maybe someone here can help me narrow it down to books or techniques that deal with them? Thank you in advance! 

\- Impulsivity to post for attention or to check in on friends all the time

- i treat people like they’re my best friend if i like them initially. some people i have to warm up to but others i instantly think we’re partners in crime after one smoke sesh 

\- Impulsivity to cut off all friends 

\- Mood swings that I internalize, but sometimes slip if I'm triggered enough

\- (not anymore) wanting to steal minor things from friends. Never from stores, as I get too nervous. But a $1 bill on the floor? I truly didn't see an issue with it at the time. 

\- Obsessions over actors in shows, things I do, mannerisms others do, fake situations, something someone said to me, etc. It seems like I mirror and store the things I like, and forget about the ones I don't.

\- Intrusive thoughts of hurting myself or family members. I also get thoughts of texting them randomly that I'm running away or that I hate them. I never mean it and get sad that I would even want to do that

\- I don't date because I get obsessed very easily when I notice someone is interested in me. The last guy I talked to I checked his location over 20 times a day I never mean to do this, and usually, catch myself and stop until I lose control again. 

\- Seeing others with something I want ( a tv role, a nice car, a friend group), and get very upset 

\- Sensitive to criticism. Very much. I’ll obsess over what they said and think how they’re ridiculous. i’ll catch myself and acknowledge it’s not that serious 

\- Impulses to push people's buttons. I love my friends, but I'll randomly blurt out that they're useless,. or if they tell me something I do bugs them I instantly want to do it all the time

\- The biggest issue that hinders me is the lack of continuity and lack of a sense of identity. I feel like i’m a mesh of every best trait i’ve encountered until i have an episode then the “real” me comes out  

I hope this wasn't too long, and any methods to help me as well as books, videos, etc would make the world of difference.

 I know I'm partly to blame for what's happened to me in the school sense and avoid parent conflict by holding my tongue 100% of the time which is getting very difficult, but I'll be transferring this spring and don't want to repeat that cycle and start a life where I can have friends without them fizzling out or constantly having to remind myself it's all in my head, even sometimes when it isn't. Sorry for the long read, I feel better having even told my story to avoid in its entirety. Thank you in advance:-)

edit: I now have a lot of friends over online ( schools online ) and irl mediums and I do very well with catching myself being annoying or self absorbed. Is being aware and critical of what you’re doing a good step?"
How do you tell the difference between a crush and an fp?,11,mfxb6v,4,"I’ve met someone new. At first I was attracted to them and then I felt the attraction fade for a bit, until I started getting closer to them which made the attraction come back and now I can’t tell what my feelings are anymore"
Whats a way I can practice healing my identity issues?,13,mfwif9,1,"My splitting/fragmented personality makes me feel like everything I do at the current moment defines me.

If I like singing, which I do, I feel like my identity has to be “the singer” to put it really dramatically. and I have to constantly make that aspect of my personality my whole identity. If i dont feel like singing a certain night, Ill think that i’m completely over the hobby as a whole instead of just saying “maybe i dont feel like it tonight” 

Its the same with any other hobby, personality trait that I have. I also feel very superficial. Like sometimes I’ll act a certain way because I want to come across as a certain identity, wether that be trendy, e-boy, nerdy, etc. And it affects how I see other people too. 

I just want to see myself as a complete person."
Why is the world so cruel to me?,15,mfuyyz,5,"I know that comes off as self-centred but for as long as I can remember I have always been ostracised, left out, neglected, ignored and abused. Some of my earliest memories are of friends isolating me and parents abusing me. Trying to fit in but getting rejected and embarrassed each time, at some point you breakdown and wonder “why me” and “why can’t I” and a plethora of such foundation shaking questions, not that I had a foundation to begin with. Friends never stick, family uses you and you’re just sort of a liability tagging along everywhere never the centre of anyone’s world. Sometimes I convince myself that I don’t care, sometimes I accept that I do care and sometimes it motivates me to change my life but I’m stuck in an endless cycle of trying to keep up and trying to fit in, I want to break out of this pattern of trying to weasel my way into other people’s world and create my own but I always end up chasing. Is there any way that I can consistently motivate myself to get out of this? If not I’m just about ready to end it all. This can’t be life. I am meant for better, how am I still here and why does no one want me around."
A metaphor for BPD recovery.,15,mfthcx,4,"At one point I was part of a crew, a family of behaviors, who roamed the oceans. We were a pirate crew. We had no home of our own except the ship that we sailed on.

We tied ourselves up to other ships when we came across them. We would dress ourselves up so we didn't appear threatening and for a time we would sail, tied to these other boats. The boats tied together were safer. They weathered storms because they were wider. We shared provisions. We relied on each other.

The issue, however, is that my crew and I were pirates. We had been raised in a way that meant that all we knew was the pirate life. We didn't know how to be a ship that was self-sustaining like the ones we tied up to.

Slowly but surely over time the ships we tied on to would realize that we were masquerading. 

Our pirate guise would become visible during a storm or when resources became stretched. If we sensed that the other ship was going to uncover us we would hack and slash and burn the connections that kept the ships together and sail away, leaving the other ship to wallow and recover.

Sometimes we'd see a new ship on the ocean. Bright and shiny and not worn down like the one we had slowly aged. In the night we'd sail over to the new ship, leaving a skeleton ship in place to fool the original one.

One day, standing on the bow of the ship I looked around and the fog that was often on this ocean cleared a little. Maybe it was the light, maybe it was the breeze, maybe I looked a little bit harder than usual.

All around me I saw ships that my crew had harmed. They were the same ships they had been, but with subtle differences.

Some no longer caught the wind in their sails like they used to. On some, their colors were faded. Others had erected protective barriers around them or invested heavily in weapons to keep them safe.

This ocean hadn't been like this before…it had only become this way because of us.

I turned to my crew and implored to them that we needed to change our ways, but they refused. Time went by and I witnessed more casualties and eventually I decided that this was not my crew. I could be somewhere else. I longed for seas where the sun glistened off clear waves.

I confronted my crew once again and begged for change, but they revolted on me. If I wanted change, I would have to leave the ship. They would give me no provisions, no boat, no support…If I wanted to leave, I could leave and swim for land. Or I could stay. 

There was no land in sight. I had never even seen land.

If I left, I would be swimming away from the ship into an open ocean. I would have to swim past ships who would look at me and laugh at me. Ships that would not pick me up if I were floundering.

For weeks I didn't sleep. My crew was all I had ever known. They were my family. I didn't even know how long I could swim for.

One day the crew broke away from another ship. What was once lovely and fair was left battered and broken, limping back to a port far away. My crew laughed and jeered and started looking for a new ship.

Standing on the deck I watched that ship sail away and resolved to never let that situation happen again.

I knew I couldn't swim very well so I decided to learn. I read at night while my crew mocked me. I learned everything I could about how to survive in an ocean alone. I confronted the fear and the risks and decided that swimming for shore was better than staying on board the boat with this sick crew. The mist had started to clear in recent weeks and as a result I could see the never-ending horizon. The enormity of the challenge was intimidating but it also helped me mentally prepare for what appeared to be an impossible task ahead.

Then one day, with my crew mocking and jeering me, some of them pleading with me to not leave, I stood on the end of the plank and stared over the ocean towards a land mass that I couldn't even imagine.

Many of the crew pleaded with me that they would die without me. Some willed me on, knowing that I would fail and swim back to the boat, where I would be even more of a hostage.

Finally, I thought of the broken ships and my resolve to never be part of creating another one and I dived overboard.

As I hit the ocean's surface the fear caught me and took my breath away…I couldn't do it. The ship was a safe harbor, there is nothing for me out here in an ocean that is threatening to swallow me up. 

I tread water, desperately wanting to climb back on board but I soon noticed that treading water was ok. I continued to tread water, listening to the pleas of my crew, until I felt like I could move away from the boat.

Turning my back to the ship and crew I had known all my life I took a deep breath and started swimming strong yet still uncertain strokes towards a horizon that didn't end, and a shore that might not exist."
Comfort attachment,8,mfxxso,9,"Does anyone else have intensely extreme long term attachments to stuffed animals / blankets / comfort items? I’m 22 and I still can’t sleep a night without my stuffed bear. I sucked my thumb into my teen years, too, not something I’m proud of as an adult, but at least I’ve graduated (unfortunately, with smoking but that’s the next one off the list. Damn you addictive oral fixations!)"
Unexpected and Effective Resource for my BPD Management,16,mftrmj,4,"(Female, age 30, married with one 3.5 year old daughter. Prescribed 300mg Wellbutrin XL, and have completed both CBT (didn't help a ton) and DBT (helped somewhat), and regularly see a counselor and psychiatrist.)

It's so hard to master emotional management, since it's something we SHOULD have been taught as children. Just like learning a new language, it's easy for kids, and a nightmare for adults.

In my DBT course, they tried to teach us how to 'distract' ourselves from our moods. My husband might go take a long hot bath if he is stressed. If I tried the same, I'd simply be feeling stressed out... except I'd be in a bathtub instead. A nice walk? I'd still be stressed out, except I'm now outside. I have a hard time getting self-care to boost my mood.

I had an emotionally neglectful mother who punished me for any display of negative moods. Being upset was 'inappropriate'. Stop that. We aren't discussing anything else until you're not upset. (Spoiler alert, even after the mood has past, no one re-visits the 'problem')

Instead of reading material designed for adults with mood disorders, I ended up reading two parenting books:

1. How to Talk So Kids Will Listen, and Listen So Kids Will Talk (Adele Faber)
2. The Explosive Child (Ross Greene)

These books teach you how to teach *children* how to manage tough situations. Since it's designed to teach young children, the material is *so* basic, simple and straightforward.  I ended up picking up TONS of communication tricks and tips that 100% work with my own moods.

Both books talk about how to use simple, but creative, problem solving. Because children, let alone stressed children, aren't very good at complex solutions. So the methods in the books are SO SIMPLE and EASY TO USE."
How to Get Help,2,mg6pvl,2,"I have called so many different places to get therapy or medication, or both and nobody has gotten back to me. I was watching a show today called ""My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" (It's on Netflix) where it starts out as a comedy and she progressively does crazier and crazier things to end up with the guy that she loves, and ends up with a diagnosis of BPD. And it really hit home because I recognized a lot of parts of myself in her but it also hurt because she's able to get help when she wants it, and although I've tried, I can't.   


I don't want to end up committed again but I really really need help. This show also makes me feel sad because she has people who care about her, and I essentially have nobody. So now I'm feeling really depressed and hopeless because I can't get help and that's all i want now.   


TL,DR: I can't get any places to call me back to help me."
I always feel like I’m unlovable.,2,mg5z3a,5,"I don’t usually get the feeling that i’m unworthy of loves. I feel i’m unlovable. See, people like me at the begging, and i believe that they may develop romantic feelings for me.. but there’s something wrong with me (that i still don’t know what it is) that just make them leave. Maybe it’s my unrealistic fear of being abandoned or even cheated on. 
I don’t know, honestly. That feeling causes me so much pain.. I feel like everyone that leaves me become so better and much happier without me. Maybe I’m the kind of person that never stays in anyone’s lives.. I wish i had a long term relationship or friendship. It hurts to be alone all the time."
Two Loofahs. A stupid poem I wrote.,3,mg2n35,0,"Two Loofahs

Something here is different.
I can’t quite place it yet 
Something is not the same

Hot water pounds my back
T I P P I N G me to a solid ground 

In the corner is the shelf I built
Our soaps and shampoos stacked
On three levels, slimy
With soap scum I haven’t scrubbed
Off yet.

That is still the same.

On the other side is the curtain
My sister and I hung
To contain the water, to hold the heat,
The curtain is still the same,
The same from when we strung it, strung out
At midnight over a year ago
So you could take a shower.
No, that’s still the same.

On the wall is the slow and ever-building 
Smudge of pink from soap left over
Scumming on the side.
It’s still there, because I scrubbed a week ago
And the scum spreads everyday.
The predictable growth of ick
Is as steady as a sunrise,
So no, that’s still the same.

Something here is different.

On the wall are two hooks,
Two white solid hooks,
Stoic in their wet presence.
I hung two hooks a year ago,
A year ago in our shower, and on
The two hooks are two loofahs,
And something here is different.

A year ago: two hooks, two loofahs.
I bought it all at Walmart, and your loofah
Was black. Mine green. 
Patching together a life for us
Trying
Me crumbling and glueing and
Trying. 

Something here is different.
Two hooks, two loofahs.
Yours blue, mine green.
Yours blue
Yours blue
Something here is different 

But something is the same
And it’s the C R U S H I N G,
The lonely, the “am I even here?” 

And I’m patching and crumbling and
Glueing and crumbling and
Breaking and dying and
Alone.

And you have a blue loofah.
And I am feeding a black hole.


Edit: sorry for shitty format. I don’t know how to fix it"
I saw a post that was deleted earlier about someone being offended that bpd is in the same personality cluster as aspd/npd,201,mfdsfq,84,"Cluster B is grouped together as the “dramatic/erratic/impulsive” personalities that’s all there is to it. 

The second thing that upset me was that just like none of us chose to have bpd, no one chooses to have npd/aspd. No one wants to live a life that is so different from the ‘normal human experience’ I believe that regardless of the defensiveness that can sometimes make us/me think otherwise. 

And i understand to an extent where they were coming from, in that people with aspd have a higher likelihood of causing harm due to impaired empathy but like we also unintentionally (for the most part i assume) cause harm just being who we are too. And i think that just because none of us chose to be this way, doesn’t make any of us less responsible for trying to manage/treat the parts of us that make life difficult on us/others. I didn’t appreciate the shaming because it triggered the shame i felt when i got my bpd diagnosis tbh, but I understand it probably came from a bad experience with someone who has aspd. 

There is no point to this I’ve just been thinking about it since i saw that post, but i wish successful treatment for all of us and an improved quality of life for us and our loved ones.

Edit: grammar"
On new meds and feel like I'm losing it,1,mg8mq4,0,"The last few months I've been feeling so anxious and fearful and I feel like everything is fake, like maybe this isn't all real or that I died a long time ago and this is some weird afterlife or simulation. 

I broke down last night because I was sure that I was actually dead and that I had done something terrible many years ago and had killed myself. 

I went and saw my doctor today and was sure she was going to put me in a psych ward again but she just gave me a new prescription for Quetiapine, which is a brand of Seroquel (anti-psychotic) 

Is all this something that can happen to people with BPD? Or is this something different? I feel over time my bpd symptoms have for the most part improved, but other aspects of my mental health seem to be declining."
My boyfriend and other women,3,mg1wfk,6,"I am jealous as hell. It is so deeply ingrained in me that... I don't even know how to solve it (I am in therapy for a year but I am far from solving it, if at all).

My boyfriend is cool. He is good with people, including women. As I perceived he seems to have more or less superficial relationships mainly with women. He knows a lot of pretty women. He was ""buddies"" with young (10 years younger), pretty women from his company. He has close, pretty female friends. He also has some average female friends, but really, 70% is attractive.

You know, I kinda trust him that he wouldn't betray me. Regardless it makes me so fucking uncomfortable that he has so many pretty females he knows. I barely know handsome guys and I don't really have guy friends.

&#x200B;

What could be the reason for this that he somehow gets close with all these women? He is not too self-aware and he says it just happens but I wonder whether it is an ego-boost for him or what.

He also casually kept in touch with some ex and fuckbuddy, sending her some sex joke. We almost broke up because he told me he won't stop talking to people just because of me.

He kinda did after a while though. But he made it clear that he will keep in touch with his closer (attractive) female friends. Since then I have constant anxiety, nightmares, and really bad physical symptoms.

&#x200B;

What can be done in such a situation? I feel like I cannot leave him yet I am being destroyed by the fucking women who he knows. I also feel like a loser that I don't even have male friends or talk to males much even though I am attractive. And my (average-looking, but for me superhot) boyfriend's contact is full with pretty females.

Uh."
Fill me nowwwww!!!,9,mfugd7,9,"Normally I fill it with pets, food, weed, cigarettes, work, and sex. Last Monday I lost one of my rats followed by 2 fish shortly after.

"I’m not trying but I no longer care if I do, at all",1,mg7nsj,0,"Tw self harm, assault, suicide 

-I have gone in to a career that I’m passionate about but it’s riddled with bullying, abuse, PTSD, and inherent burnout. Cool. Can’t leave though because I’m too far in (and I actually do like it tbh)

-I am back with my ex who continues to abuse me and I eat it up for whatever reason. Honestly one of the only things I look forward to.

-my only excitement in life is my cat and my podcast. And people hate the podcast so I can’t even talk about it lmao

-I’m losing weight because I feel sick but do not have time to go to the doctor because of school obligations. And death would honestly be a relief. 

-I have no social life at all

-I have literally not properly cleaned parts of my house in YEARS now. Guess I’m just lazy haha no such thing as mental illness nope just gross. 🙄 

-I have fallen back in to self harm, skin picking, and smoking. 

-in my free time I just sleep and cry but I do not sleep at all at night

-I keep having nightmares about my assaults which happened years ago so I’m not sure why that’s coming up now.

How am I supposed to spend my life like this? I literally cannot exist in any space online or irl without people shitting on me at all times for everything I do. At this point I just want to be like “oh yeah I’m a HORRIBLE worker I just purposefully suck” like I have no clue what people even want from me. 

I feel like I can’t even go to therapy because I have no money left (I spent my entire life savings on my cat which I don’t regret but it is a little rough) and all the therapists by me are CBT. CBT sucks for me because my brain is so fundamentally obliterated that none of the tactics work. 

I sometimes feel so sick that I think I’m just going to succumb to whatever is wrong with me (which doctors always say is nothing). And I’ll drift off thinking that I was a little bitch for complaining about my problems. Then I think about how my cat will eat me and how my best friend will be so mad and how my parents will disintegrate. Tad dramatic. But I truly think it will go down. 

Finishing my stupid degree is more important than me being sick. But ideally I’ll get checked out after graduation in may. Can’t treat the sick properly if I’m super sick... lol

I think that all of my various childhood traumas and assaults and struggles have all compiled in to a death sentence. The ACES study. 

I have so much dark that it’s bound to manifest in to cancer or something. In high school I stopped eating but then that metamorphisized into a whole other thing. 

I don’t care if people think I’m cringey or dramatic or anything because I’m convinced that when I die I will leave a paper trail of failures of all the collapsed support systems in my life. And I want people to see that and realize that there are things to fix for other people.

I could go on and live a relatively normal life on the surface while I just suffer quietly in my own domain. I could get so sick I’m forced to stop and I get mad. I could just die and get eaten by my sweet geriatric cat. I’d let him.

Sometimes I think about writing down all my stupid stuff but no one cares and if people do care it’s to make fun of me. I like the people that make fun of me a lot more when they at least sleep with me. 

I love my best friend, my family, and my cat. I want to live a noble life of saving people but in actuality I can only care for them but not myself. I feel like a lost soul stuck in a vessel of flesh. Always clinging to the things that keep me going and breaking when they leave. Glueing myself back together but never whole. 

anyway also looking for recommendations for best coffee and mac and cheese.......and canned cat food that’s good for old cats.

The BPD diagnosis prevented me from getting proper health care.,14,mfok4l,5,"Hi,  


I'm really scared to write here, I'm really looking for a safe space to write down my experiences. I'm begging you all, if I say something wrong. Please tell me!  


I got my BPD diagnosis in 2011/2012. I was with a bad boyfriend back then who abused me in every way possible. But mostly gaslighting, emotional abuse and threats of harm/abandonment. I can fully see WHY I got the diagnosis back then. I was a hot mess. Almost ticked off every box of the DSM-5. My (now ex) boyfriend had a firm grip on my treatment. Went with me every time. And somehow all the fights that I talked about were turned around back on me. To the point that even my therapist was agreeing with my ex that I deserved what he gave me. 

I fell in love with someone else... ended things with my ex (cleanly if I say so myself) gave myself a few months to recuperate and started a new thing with the new guy. The coping mechanisms I had formed during my previous relationship stayed..  I was always on my guard. Got pretty isolated because my friends were his friends (we met through mutual friends). After an semi inpatient stay in an eating disorder clinic, I was told I did NOT have BPD. There was something, but they couldn't quite put their finger on it. (more on this later) Some additional testing had to be done. A letter of referral would be send to my GP. (this letter never arrived). After the treatment I went to a new school and literally all my symptoms disappeared. I became my own person. Made my own friends. Unfortunately this meant that me and my then boyfriend were drifting apart. We had different interests. And after an argument about where we were gonna live, he told me to choose between him and the house. I chose the house. 

Fast forward and I find my current husband. And we just clicked. I love the guy to bits, and of course I miss him when he is gone. (which he rarely is due to covid now. so that's gonna take some getting used to once restrictions get lifted). But I just do my thing when he was gone. I even enjoyed the me time since it gave me time to do the stuff that I liked and he didn't. 

2016 I had a surgery that left me disabled. My rehabilitation failed immensely and I was in constant pain. I did NOT get taken seriously. I've recently looked over my medical files. And they literally put in my file that they gave me an MRI to just shut me up (I had an extra surgery to get this MRI since some surgical screws had to be taken out). that my pain was out of proportion. I was called all but a hypochondriac. in 2018 it turned out that my main muscle next to the surgery site was so severely agitated that it got so knotted that I indeed could not stretch or lift my limb without pain. I've since been treated for that, and I am happy to say that I am pain free.

In 2017 I developed some physical issues besides the pain because I gained a lot of weight. I got edema in my left ankle/foot. And I don't know why. but my brain fixated on that thing. I developed a severe anxiety disorder centred around my  ankle. I went to my GP asking her for help. My GP referred me to a BPD center. To which I replied. ""I don't have BPD its been taken out of my file since 2014"". My GP said I did have it, so I either take this treatment or I take the high way. I left the office with a mark in my file that I refused treatment.

A year later I found out (with a medical professional) that I am autistic. Which explained all my difficulty in life. My GP on the other hand refused to put autism in my file. She did it reluctantly in the end. But my main diagnosis is still BPD.

I'm now 3 (almost 4) years further. I still have not received treatment for my anxiety. my life has started to become very limited due to the anxiety growing out of proportion. I'm hitting road blocks left and right when it concerns my medical care. Everything comes back to the BPD. If I twist my ankle and am in pain? Must be the BPD. I have a lump in my breast and I'm worried? Must be the BPD.  I've now been marked ""mentally complex"" and in my country it means mental health treatment stops here. No psychologist will ever touch me. 

Im not sure what I'm asking for here, I'm mostly asking for support. Some love. But this diagnosis unfortunately made my life really difficult if not impossible. And whats worse is that its not an accurate diagnosis."
"DAE love the chase of a new relationship, then suddenly lose feelings for them when a relationship becomes plausible?",127,mfdfs4,21,"I feel like I enjoy the chase a lot.. I get giddy and excitable and so overwhelmed with attraction and affection when I first start talking to someone. 
Then, as soon as we take steps to actually go on a date or something, I suddenly rethink everything and no longer want to be with/around that person. 
And after that, it's like a 50/50 chance whether or not I'll wake up one day completely obsessed with them, or completely regretting liking them. 

On a side note, does anyone only really feel attraction towards others who show interest in you? Like, I can't really develop feelings for a person until after they start showing interest in me. It feels incredibly toxic, and I do feel genuine affection towards them, but it's like the reason is that I'm only really interested in their attention."
Feeling guilty,3,mfye6d,3,"Pushed my friend group away n most of them dont matter thaaat much to me except for 1 friend i really love. I felt like she hated me and so naturally i picked up on any and all signs that supported that theory. Prior to my diagnosis i would never have questioned whether my interpretation was valid and likely would have started an argument w her about her not willing to admit that she has a problem w me. 

Anyway so i’ve been isolating myself for the past couple of weeks because i felt unwanted and truly believed she hated me but today she texted me saying “i miss you how are you” and now i feel so bad for just being cold/distant when it was likely in my head that she had a problem with me. 

I feel so embarrassed and kind of weird about going back to being around them now. Would it be easier to explain that i have bpd n that’s why i have a tendency to pick up on the negative energy more than the positive or neutral? I don’t think i want to though because i don’t want her to think different of me or treat me like a ‘charity case’ as some people do. Idk i just feel so stupid for being so upset the past couple of weeks when i probably did not have a legitimate reason to be. Is this toxic of me?"
What led you to getting your diagnosis?,2,mg18fc,9,"I don't know if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm just curious on how one gets to the subject of personality disorders, or just bdp in general, when seeing a professional?

I've been told by people with bpd to at least look into the condition and talk about it with someone. I am absolutely not out to self diagnose, that's the last thing I'd want to do. And I know that the symptoms can overlap with other disorders, making it difficult to diagnose. But I can't get over that I see so much of myself in the diagnosis and that I'm especially struggling with handling emotions and extreme fears of abandonment. 

I'm really scared that if I bring something new into my conversations with professionals it will make them think that I'm purely out to seek attention. I already have a very difficult time making people believe what I say.

So to anyone who has been professionally diagnosed, what was your journey towards a diagnosis like? How do I bring this subject into a conversation without being looked down upon? I just want to get this out of the way no matter if I actually end up having it or not."
Personal Experiences with BPD,1,mg5e89,0,"I wanted to make a general statement about my own personal experiences in doing my best to get my mind on track while struggling with all the overwhelming emotion and impulsivity that come with it which tends to make us all seem so difficult. At some point I became aware of how much more deeply I felt than others, in a debilitating way. Little comments perceived as slights would get hyper focused on. Insecurity would sink in and no matter how hard I'd try to resist indulging I would always crack, blow up on someone either out of anger or sadness, end up feeling genuinely pathetic before finally going numb and wondering why any of it mattered in the first place. It's a very real, very isolating pattern that causes some of us to feel like we'll never manage to function properly.

 Those overwhelming feelings that get misrepresented due to the lack of emotional control and comes from such a real, very relatable place and I think if more people had awareness of the loneliness, shame and isolation that breeds these kinds of outbursts it would be easier to be more sympathetic. I eventually became aware of where these feelings came from, why they seemed so out of character. There was always a part of me that felt like it was screaming and thrashing, begging me to acknowledge the overwhelming feelings and act as fast as possible to soothe them. I started telling myself we were okay, I acknowledged all the pent up repression and my own loneliness. I remind myself it's okay to feel overwhelmed in the moment, it's okay to let the feeling wash over and feel it fully as long as you remember to let it go and approach whatever caused the feeling in a calmer state of mind. I believe whatever we've been through personally has given us the full spectrum of pain and emotion to an extent not everyone is made to feel. 

I'm not sure if I'd call it a silver lining or a gift but I'm glad to feel as much as I do. If we're vulnerable in one moment we can be stronger in the next and with the capacity to feel these debilitating, image shattering emotions is the chance to grow from every feeling. If you feel ashamed of your actions do your best to understand where they came from, try to catch those patterns and get ahead of your feelings. Remind yourself what it's like to feel a lot and that you've always come out of it in the end. I've spent a lot of time trying to get a handle on myself, I spent years struggling and feeling like I was this explosive problem. I've grounded myself with a core set of values based around how strongly I feel and the depth of the emotions we struggle with. 

I wanted to share my thoughts on BPD and mental illness in general because I truly believe a little understanding goes a really long way for people who feel so strongly and so misrepresented by their own actions. It's a very lonely, personal struggle and I just wanted to make a statement for anyone who's felt like me or like I do now or who can relate or take comfort in these words in any way. I'm sincerely proud to feel as much as I do, with pain comes perspective. I'd love to hear how other people try to take control of their feelings or even how you struggle with them. If anyone is willing to share their personal viewpoints on their own feelings I'm genuinely interested in the sense that I could learn from it and in the sense that we can share in the experience of being understood."
im doing a lot doesnt feel like enough,1,mg56jm,2,"doing a lot but no one around me cares. life seems to be unempathetic and a series of do this, do that, live life the way i intended. i live life the way i do and it's by the skin of my teeth. it's the facade and bullshit, life's just flashing between moments. i'm here and not there but way over there. if shit's a dream, then who'd care. 

i'm putting effort to stay here but it's not a single fuck given. can't be bothered to have self care cos i'm just acting plain silly. 

it's hard but i'm the abuser, not the victim, not in this moment, but i was once, and it's still stinging. i'm doing what i can to renew but god damn do i only see the old within the new. 

who the fuck is everyone, really? just a part of me, tormenting me, a side of me that i can't handle. i feel sick to my stomach in knots. i'm just hopeless in a land i've created, my own mind's prison glistening eye. 

i see past the torment pain and love and i see sheer terror. death looming nearby about to swipe all i know. and what of then when I'm gone who's to know. maybe i'm god or maybe i'm not. 

deaths always stalking a leering beast waiting till i look away to sink its teeth im terrified yet i cant stop looking into those soulless eyes waiting to take me in. 

fuck all this shit nothing ever feels real and im so unstable cos i feel im the only one that gets that. there sother parts but we cant connect cos were paralyzed under fear. i am too i dont want to connect i feel safe in repetitive comfort."
Thank god I found this subreddit,3,mfvlpy,1,"I was recently diagnosed with BPD (even though deep down I’ve known about having it for a long time,) and now I found this subreddit. I’m slowly learning more and more about myself and my life, and I feel super validated that I’m not a piece of shit - this is real. I feel it destroying my life and It feels out of control, but just learning about it and other people’s experience has been really helpful. Thank you."
feeling guilty about random things in the past,2,mg04es,1,"i wonder if this has anything to do with anything, but i recently hit 26 and now i'm bombarded with these obsessive thoughts of things i've done and said when i was younger that didn't bother me then. has my brain matured and now i realize stuff like that isn't okay? is this bpd related at all? has anyone else experienced this?? help please i can't deal with it all"
Hello fellow older borderliners,198,mf970p,89,"I searched the sub for “older” today and found a couple threads with people closer to my age. I felt so much less alone.  Thanks to you all older folks that posted in those threads.

I wasn’t even diagnosed until my mid 40s, so although I feel at home with the feelings people discuss, I have felt out of place reading posts here.  It’s a weird place to be, 1/2+ of the way through life yet just at the beginning of the bpd journey.  I had a pretty good life in retrospect, but I blew it up, and now I know bpd is why I did that.  Happiness-wise I’m probably about the same many days.

I’ve been attempting to rebuild a life since I blew it up half a decade ago (I haven’t known about the bpd until more recently).  It’s always 1 step forward, 2 steps back, and COVID has been like a tornado that blew me back almost to the starting line..."
DAE Have a theme for each session in therapy?,2,mfzr1q,6,"Rather than talking about your week and how that was, does anyone have specific ideas that you both explore? I was talking with my therapist today, and we both felt like we were in a car and I was asking to go to certain places then suddenly wanting to go somewhere else, meaning I have 101 issues and trying to talk about them all is impossible and makes me feel frustrated. So instead, we decided to pick the themes Self Compassion and Self Soothing since they are the root of the problem which we will talk about next time. 

I think I'll be a little disappointed that I will no longer share what's been going on with me with her but I guess therapy is for working on things rather than venting (or at least, that's I've been doing and it hasn't worked)"
"Are you a family member or partner of an adult with PTSD? If yes, please keep reading. (Mod Approved)",0,mg3wp0,0," Hi everyone! I am a graduate student at Bowling Green State University working on *part 2* of my dissertation which seeks to explore the utility of a new inventory researchers designed which was created to measure and understand the service and support needs of family members (such as spouses, partners, parents, etc.) of people with PTSD.  I thought that this community might be a good place to recruit from because I know that BPD and PTSD can co-occur. I touched base with the mods and they approved this post. I hope that if this applies to anyone in this group that you'll consider taking this survey! This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board at Bowling Green State University. Below, you will see a link to participate in the study.

DAE have problems with perception of time?,10,mfnkar,1,"Sorry if this is a weird question. I've been having problems recently with my perception of time - hours feel like days, days feel like weeks, etc. - and I wondered if it was a BPD thing. It's mostly an issue when I'm left alone / have no one to talk to / feel like I haven't spoken to a friend in *ages* (then realise it's only been a few hours / a day or two). If anyone has any advice on how to manage this sort of thing, that would be appreciated as well, but it's okay if not!"
I’m nothing but a bitch,1,mg3lwx,3,"When my fp and I get into an argument, he tells me he doesn’t care if i have bpd.. like at all. Honestly, hearing that enrages me even more, which makes the argument even worse! I get triggered by the smallest things and I’m labeled as a “drama queen”. I’ve told him multiple times what triggers me and he doesn’t care cause he continues to do it. For example, he loves the word ‘bitch’, every time we argue it’s ‘you dumb bitch’, ‘psychotic bitch’, ‘stupid retard bitch’, etc. 
Hearing someone who claims they “love” me say that saddens me. It makes me question everything and I start to get paranoid.
  
**my fp M22 has depression, generalized anxiety, ADHD, and is possibly bipolar**

tbh our relationship is falling apart and I’m so fucking scared to lose him.. he said that i’m getting worse (I was recently diagnosed in Feb). Also, he recently told me that when we argue he just wants to beat me tf up and that he despises me. We argue about the same things too, I feel like it’s all my fucking fault. I feel like i’m the reason he doesn’t wanna have sex, text me, or be around me.. he even said he doesn’t even know why he’s with me anymore and that he doesn’t respect me or our relationship. I know I’m a lot to put up with and I have my flaws, but at the end of the day, I just wanna be enough..."
Does anyone else never act like how they truly feel?,8,mfox2k,7,"I hate where I am, I hate who I surround myself with and I hate who I act like here and with said people but I am so scared of being alone, so scared. So I just keep morphing into whatever is around me. If I just act how I feel I’d be where I’d want to be in life but I don’t so I’m stuck pretending. Pretending I’m happy with this city, these people and everything abs of I don’t snap out of it I’ll be stuck here forever."
discussion time... how aware are you that people live just fine lives and do not have severe mental illness?,37,mfhhzg,10,"im going to ask my psychiatrist about this when i go back next week. 


this sort of dawned on me the other day... there must be a lot of people that live their daily lives without constant struggle.


...right?


the world couldnt function if everyone else was like me. all i have known for my entire adult life is constant struggle, distress, not being able to take care of myself, not being able to hold down a job. ive seen my coworkers go about their lives, been working those jobs for 10 years. i can hardly keep a single aspect of my life together for *2 weeks*...


do people really live without constant mental pain? i cant imagine how that feels. i cant imagine holding it together. it feels like a stupid question. it feels stupid to ask; do people really just wake up, go to work, so some hobbies/chores, go to bed, and not feel reality falling apart???? it seems like yeah, obviously. but i just cant imagine it. 


i know if you also have BPD you might not be able to answer this question. and i know everyone will experience some degree of depression/anxiety in their life, but it doesnt completely consume who they are. i would like to discuss these things."
i spiral when i research about BPD,29,mfibr8,8,"weirdly enough, one of my biggest triggers is researching BPD. but i do it anyways knowing it always sends me spiraling. 
seeing those books about how to deal with loving someone with BPD rlly puts me in a bad spot. theres just so much stigma around it"
"Note to myself: Boundaries are for you, not other people.",18,mfknss,2,"My goal is to lead a meaningful life in line with my values. 

I can only go so far down certain roads before I become so emotionally disregulated that I am a danger to myself and others. 

Other people may be able to go further down those roads than I can.  Good for them. They may encourage me to join them. Not good for me. 

No matter how much I want to keep walking by their side, when I see the landmarks, I have to stop. 

But here’s the thing: only I can see the landmarks.  They’re invisible to everyone else. 

So, before we get close to a landmark, I have to let people know. hey, I have some limitations that I’ll be observing to keep myself safe. 

When we’re approaching the landmark, I can point it out specifically.  ‘I can feel myself becoming disregulated. I’m going to need to [hang up/go home/take a break/come back to this conversation when I can show up in a way I can be be proud of.]

The people who are safe to be close to won’t mind at all. It’s just information to them. They may decide to stay on this side of the landmark to spend time with me, or they may decide that it’s too restrictive and they can’t work around my limitations. Whatever they decide, they will treat me with kindness, consideration, and respect.  They may not understand me, but they believe me. What they will not do is belittle me for respecting my own boundaries. 

The people who are not safe to be close to respond very differently. They will try to convince me that those landmarks aren’t really there, and that nothing bad will happen if I cross my boundaries. That I’m being dramatic. Over-reacting. Making it all about me. 

They will berate me for not walking down the road with them.  If I listen to them, and try to go past the landmarks, I will become emotionally dysregulated. At that point, I can expect to be blamed, shamed, and belittled.

They shouldn’t do any of those things. But I can’t control any of that. All I can control is what I do when I get close to a landmark."
I ruined my relationship because I can’t distinguish the past from the present,4,mfsqux,4,"Well...I completely had a break down and now my boyfriend is breaking it off because I broke up with him and think he’s gross and an asshole for having a past before we met....what’s wrong with me? Why do I care? I think because he fucked with my head even tho he offered to pay for therapy and I messed it all up. Oh well it will be okay💕 the future is exciting.
 I can’t get over his past and I act like he’s cheating on me presently.

How can I repair it? I think it’s way to late."
"Bf and I broke up, but it's more like a break? I'm not sure how to react?? losing my mind",2,mfxr4m,1,"My boyfriend (well ex now) had a tumultuous relationship. It started off on the wrong foot, but there was a lot of love and passion there. We truly believe we are each others 'one'. We had to break up due to needing to both grow individually and heal from some relationship hurts we've caused one another.  At the time of the break up, I suggested a break and he said no. A break up makes it feel like we are severing the ties of the old relationship and aren't bound to one another... It was in essence a way to walk away from the old and hopefully start something new one day.

We tried no contact, didn't work. We couldn't stay away from one another. He then said he rather go on a break, but I didn't want that... I wanted the break up too... He's told me countlessly that he isnt using this time to move on. He wants to be better for himself and be better for me, but I keep taking it as he will move on...forget about me...realize he no longer loves me... he's trying to manipulate me to hang on only for him to move on knowing he has me as a backup...my thoughts are racing and I dont know what's real and what's an exaggeration. He was so loving and affectionate and showed me he missed me last week...this week he's a bit distanced. He said it's because he's sick (got hit hard with allergies), but I still feel sensitive and don't want to believe him...my mind just goes straight into paranoid thinking...he's hurt me before, most of it due to my BPD and pushing him away and then him leaving because of it but, he always comes back...I'm really scared. I was doing ok with the break up last week, but I spent the weekend with him...it was really nice, we ended up getting intimate too, and now I feel broken and completely set back. We're starting no contact tomorrow for 3 - 4 weeks... I'm terrified of what's going to happen at the end of it. I keep thinking I should move on despite what he said and promised...I feel played...And idk if its because he really did or im forcing myself to believe he did...  
this is conjuring up a shit ton of abandonment issues...trust issues...self esteem issues. it makes me feel unlovable, gullible, replaceable, worthless, meaningless...like i'll never be good enough. This shit is invoking a panic attack :("
ADHD & BPD,5,mfsn33,3,"Does anyone else diagnosed with ADHD &amp;amp; BPD struggle figuring out which disorder is fueling certain symptoms?

There’s so much overlap with both disorders:
- Poor emotional regulation
- mood swings
- bad concept of time
- impulsivity
- rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD)
- high rates of self harm 
- difficultly maintaining tasks that lack immediate reward
- outbursts
- high reactivity

The list goes on and on. I struggle being able to tell which disorder is affecting what and I often think they just work together to amplify certain symptoms. I want to be able to discern what is the root of certain symptoms so I have the ability to better navigate treatment options. 

I have bad reactions to all medications so it’s important for me to take a little as possible. If the BPD is affecting me the most I will learn to live with the side effects of mood stabilizers but if it’s ADHD I would want to learn to live with the side effects of stimulants. I cannot have side effects from both or I’ll be too sick."
Feeling attacked when I don't understand something,138,mf91jv,23,When ever I ask someone for help with work / homework or with understanding anything really if they explain it to me and I don't understant immediately I start feeling very stupid. Then as they continue explaining my brain shuts down completely and I just go into this sudden spiral of hating myself so so bad because I think I'm the dumbest person on Earth for not understanding and then I'm convinced that the person explaining (especially if it's my FP) hates me and is angry at me and is deliberately trying to explain it in a way that I won't understand because they want to hurt me and belittle me and make fun of me... and it's just blinding rage from then on... Does anyone else have this?
Today's a good day,7,mfn65a,6,"After living with financial struggles for months, i finally got a job!!

Additional to that, i had no money. I lived from bill to bill and then one of my rabbits got sick... 500$ vet bill. I borrowed the money from mom and a friend, but i hate debts so i paid it back asap. But then i ended up with no money. I went grocery shopping with coins i found at home... 

but thats over now!! I'm so happy!!

BTW: I applied for like 30 jobs, already had one and had to quit, i started to apply again.. things take time and patience."
Having a hard time..,3,mftdkg,0,"I think I'm about to ""relapse"" with SH...

Going from kinda liking the way I look to absolutely despising everything about me in a very short time. Anyone Else?,30,mfh33d,9,"I kinda have this extreme instability of my self image. It literally effects the way I see myself on pictures and in the mirror and it's pretty scary. Sometimes I take pictures and I'm like ""oh yes that's really good"". then my self image falls apart because my negative emotions take over and I end up really fucking hating the pictures of me that I used to love. I sometimes even end up deleting photos that are old...I really regret doing that from time to time.

What's more scary is: the more I look at myself when my self esteem is low and my self image is very negative, the angrier I get and that makes it worse. To the point where I literally cut myself to punish myself for having such a disgusting body.

I have scars on my chest that had to get stitches. I cut my chest because I hated that my heart was beating inside of it, keeping my gross body alive..  
Every time I feel pretty or whatever I end up thinking, that it might just be an illusion or something.  
Every time I do something wrong or I feel bad or fucked up or whatever I cannot stand my reflection in the mirror. I even ended up smashing one.  


Has anyone had similar experiences? :("
Has the pandemic upended anyone else's marriage?,3,mfsp5w,4,"Been happily married for 5 years. But this last year is different. We're both working full time from home and taking turns with childcare. It's been so god awful on my bpd. I am feeling smothered, needy, angry, hypercritical of myself and my spouse, with even more severe anxiety and depression. I am full of internal rage or fatigue so often, and just so easily triggered into catastrophic or dangerous thoughts. I love my spouse and think we can pull through, but my brain continues devaluing him and blaming things on him. It's been a long time since I've had a single day without intrusive thoughts.

I really think this is happening because of the pandemic. It's forced us into this unnatural situation of being together, at home, 247. Marriage is forever, but it's not 247! I'm trying to take responsibility for my negative thoughts and trying to improve my mood but it's so damn difficult under these circumstances."
DAE wish they had something physically wrong with them instead.,41,mfetlc,10,"I was called back to work...but quickly burned out and had to go on medical leave. Afraid of losing my job, I went back way too early. The day I was supposed to go back...I had a nasty panic attack and realized that I couldn't go back.

I'm in the process of trying to find a psychiatrist who can treat me for these issues I have before I end up either involuntarily committed or dead. You'd think me being furloughed for close to a year would allow me to work on my mental health but it didn't.

Now my other coworkers (who got let go during the cutbacks) are posting about coming back and I'm feeling like shit. Why couldn't I stay strong long enough for these people to come back and take the load off?

I feel like a burden and that everyone else at work is only polite on the outside. Inside, I feel like they hate me because I'm too lazy to keep up. But I know the stigma around mental illnesses, especially BPD.

When I complained to my FP that I wished I had cancer, a limp or heart problems instead, at least people see those things and are understanding...he got mad. He survived cancer himself and both of his parents are battling cancers themselves. He told me that I should never wish for something like that.

And I see his point; being sick is not something anyone actively wants, especially with an illness that can be terminal.

But people can't see you fighting demons when the demons are in your head. They can't see you getting tired and inwardly screaming for help when you're able to walk and talk just like everyone else. They don't see you looking at the pills, the homemade noose, the knife, the gun or the long drop you're standing in front of and praying someone will find you before the pain takes over.

All they see is a person who has all the physical abilities to function but seemingly chooses to not get up.

I wish I didn't feel so alone."
i can't tell the difference between love and obsession,38,mfesnw,9,"I don't think i've ever felt true love before, all my relationships were unstable and hurt me a lot, but lately i've been talking to a girl and now im attached to her. I can't tell if what i feel for her it's love or obsession, i feel so happy and free when she's around, seems like i found the love of my life, but when she's busy or is rude to me i can feel my world collapse. All that love and hapiness that i felt before turn into rage, i say to myself that i don't wanna see her ever again, that i hate her so much and stuff like that. Do i really love her or do i just need someone to gimme support and approval?

(also im not a native english speaker so im sorry for my poor grammar)"
How to slow down,1,mfzp33,3,"How do you slow a relationship down?
My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half months. We already say we love each other and have both made comments about the future. We see each other every day and talk almost all day. 
It seemed like everything was good and that we were on the same page but he has asked to slow things down. Says we don't need to act like we are getting married next week (and I completely understand that). I just feel a little blind sided and confused. How do I feel like he isn't leaving or like he doesn't want to? How do I be comfortable with taking things slower? He can't completely explain what slower looks like. I'm scared that I'll overwhelm him and ruin everything. How do I get it together before I ruin every relationship like I always do? I want to be fair to him."
"""They'll never love you as much as you love them.""",98,mf8eyz,19,"This is what I heard about BPD once or twice. That a person with BPD will always be more emotionally invested in relationships than another person. I was never sure about that until recently. My best friend and I stopped talking, so now I don't really have anyone close to me. I do have some people to chat with, but it's different. 

Also excruciating.

I'm always the one who initiates conversations, it never happens the other way. Usually it's fun, but later I analyse them and feel like that person didn't actually enjoy talking to me. They just did it because it would be rude to ignore or refuse, because they know that I don't really have people to talk to. I practically feel like I'm begging them for any scraps of attention and sympathy. It feels nauseating. 

I'm trying to rationalize it. They're busy and don't really have time for me. I myself seem rather cold so they don't want to approach me first. But rationalising doesn't help much. It still feels like I'm trying to communicate with these people, get close to them, but they don't want to. And they won't even tell me about it. Like they're playing some kind of game. I know they don't. But it sure feels like it.

I wanted to send all of it to one of these people. But I figured it won't be a good idea, so here I am. According to the flair, I don't seek advice. I just need... I just needed to write it all down because it was hurting me. Yeah. That's kinda it."
Is anybody else genuinely friendless and alone?,26,mfg9oa,4,"I don't mean, like, occasionally self-isolating or ""only"" having one close friend or a boyfriend, but being straight up friendless against your will.

For over 8 years, I've been really alone (a lot of it has been down to shitty circumstances like homeschooling during high school, taking gap years, transferring to a new university during COVID, etc) and struggled A LOT with having any social life whatsoever. This has prevented me from having a lot of basic life experiences any other 23 year old I know has had, and I haven't had any friends I've actually felt close to and trusted in adulthood whatsoever.

The worst part is that I literally don't even know why I lost most of my veryyyy few remaining friends over the past few months too? (Not a friend group--separate people) No arguments, no weird moments, nothing. Some of them suddenly started making up random excuses for months on end, or we'll even agree to a vague plan during a certain timeframe (ie: over the weekend) and have normal text conversations until I ask ""So which day works better for you if you're still down?"" and they ghost me. I haven't even been in our city much until now since I spent the previous two quarters on campus (these people were ones I keep in touch with, although we don't text nonstop daily or anything), yet they COMPLETELY changed their attitudes towards me. They make up excuses to not invite me to things and lead normal social lives outside of this, so it's not like they're self-isolating. Similarly, every guy I like just uses me for sex before getting bored and suggesting being ""friends,"" aka never seeing me again and also progressively ghosting me.

My mental health has gone downhill because I relied a lot on just being AROUND people at school and work to try to cope with not having friends. I've relapsed into a severe ED, my self harm has progressed and gotten more frequent, and I fear that I'm going to have an actual psychotic break and not be able to get through spring because I have such bad BPD episodes (no, not around others) that I can't even recognize myself anymore.

I'm the only person I know in this situation so idk, any kind words or similar experiences are welcome. Feel free to vent :'')"
"My bestfriend split on me, she finally texted me yesterday telling me she had a nightmare about me :(",2,mfu6x6,0,After about a month of no contact she finally texted me back yesterday telling me she had a dream where I was hurting her and locked the door and told her she couldn’t leave :( she said she was screaming and crying in the dream. I told her It’s her subconscious being affected it’s not her fault I told her she knows the real me the person who talked to her every day and spent time with her held her when she was crying and gave her so much love and cuddles 🥺 I told her I only want to be part of her good dreams not her nightmares. I’m honestly glad she communicated with me for the first time in basically a month after the split but it makes me sad she was scared and hurt in her dream because of me :(
I Don't Feel Good Enough Because of What My S/O Did In Bed Please Help Me Cope I Have No Self Worth Right Now,38,mfe7sk,15,"They asked first, but they watched porn-like content while we were sleeping together. I mean, literally at the exact same time. I said yes because I was shocked they would ask to do that when I was right there, giving them what I thought I wanted. When I felt them get more and more into what was on the screen I couldn't stop but going into a fit of both sadness and rage. I wasn't good enough for them, why am I not good enough for them? I know it's normal for people to watch content during sex to get off, but I can't stop myself from crying and cutting because I couldn't do enough. I sadly use sex as a way of having self-worth, and my sex wasn't good enough so I'm not good enough. It's been over a week, I still can't stop crying over this.

I tried bringing it up to them and they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. I got so upset I just dropped it. It's been a week now, I can't bring myself to talk to them about it because they probably think I'm pathetic. I am pathetic."
I want to trust them,1,mfyw6b,1,"I want to so bad. It seems too good to be true. Can they really be that loyal? Are they always telling me the truth, or are they crafting a version of themselves that will not face judgment, or scrutiny.
I don’t want to be made a fool. I truly love them and would never hurt them in the ways I imagine them hurting me.
I could never look them in the eye, then run Into someone else’s arms. I could never cheat on them or lie about having feelings for someone else.
Why can’t I always believe this person? Why does my gut make me question them. It’s little innocuous, micro disturbances that my brain is scanning.
I have to push it down and reason it away. Reasoning your feelings..."
It’s long but I really need some advice from someone who can actually relate..,2,mftj0h,0,"

About 4 years ago after being diagnosed with severe depression and a burnout, I was diagnosed with bpd when I started therapy. I had a bad experience with my first therapist and therefore completely discarded the diagnosis because I felt like they fucked up. 
A psychiatrist later diagnosed me again but since I had already decided it wasn’t true, I just put it aside and pretended it never happened. 

I’m in a relationship with my boyfriend for almost two years now and have always been very fond of him. A few issues came up on my part; trauma, massive intimacy issues, etc. He’s very supportive and understanding and I really felt I had found my person with him. We’ve been in a weird situation lately, we had to move back in with our parents after losing our house and now since 2-3 months he has found a job here and is living with me at my dad’s house. There’s a lot of pressure and stress on this situation and I’ve tried my hardest to fix it. It’s been hard but at least we’re together. 

A few weeks ago I lost my job as well and it worsened my mental state even more. I made a post on r4r cause I felt like making a friend and having the world seem a bit bigger (I’m assuming I did this as a means of escape). I started talking with someone and we still are. I haven’t told my boyfriend. I wanted but this person has sort of expressed an interest in me and now I feel like I can’t say anything cause it’ll look bad and hurt him. All I know is I’m enjoying talking to this person and I don’t know want to stop. I just hate myself for getting in these kind of situations all the time and doing something that might possibly hurt my bf. 

I’ve always had the feeling that if someone liked me, I must have manipulated them into doing so and this came up while talking to this Reddit person. It reminded me of the diagnosis I got years ago and it suddenly hit me; they were absolutely right. I’ve been reading about it and the more I did the clearer it became but I’m really struggling to accept it. 
When I’m in a bad state of mind and feel trapped, I start dissociating and I’m afraid I’m splitting on my boyfriend. 
I really don’t want to cause I was really happy with him but it feels irreversible. 
I’m constantly spending my time alone and telling him I need to be alone cause I’m struggling. When I am spending time with him I feel on edge and a massive pressure to be cuddly or lovey dovey (which I simply am not so much as a person but it’s getting worse now) and it’s fueling the splitting. 

I’m really quite new to the bpd thing and what it actually means. Is this relationship doomed? Is it just my state of mind causing this or did I just fall out of love? Should I maybe not be in a relationship at all? I know I’m not exactly being very clear about what’s bothering me but I’m hoping to get some advice or talk to someone that has had similar experiences. 
I’m too much in my head and I can’t explain it to anyone. I’m really afraid I’m gonna hurt someone again."
emotional regulation & recognizing signs before chaos ensues,3,mfqerx,2,"when I’m becoming emotionally dysregulated, it’s hard for me to know until I’ve split and done something detrimental to my life or relationship. this has always been a problem, but I’m more aware of the pattern in my behavior now. I want to notice when I’m feeling dysregulated, take the space to get myself back on track, and come back. I think it’s hard because when I’m dysregulated, it’s usually out of fear and I want to create some sort of clingy chaos with the person I’m afraid of losing. and in those moments, I’m so sure that “breaking up” or hang out immediately is the best thing to do to soothe, but it’s usually not. it’s something I have to do on my own, but I don’t know when to trust myself.

how do you realize you’re not emotionally centered? are there physical signs? emotional signs? how do you know when you’re acting on emotion and not being rational, more wise mind & emotional mind work, I assume? any tips, stories, etc will help. thank you."
"Ruthlessly blocking people (not many of my friends understand why I do this, I know it’s not healthy)",12,mfk3n9,3,"Just another thing I thought of to address in therapy tomorrow. There are many people I’ve ruthlessly blocked and cut out of my life when they hurt me over the years. People from work, friend groups, people I’ve dated (this is the most prevalent one). I’m sure they don’t understand the pain they caused me that led me to make those decisions for the relationship. Sometimes I tried communicating and felt invalidated and after a certain point I just snap and want them gone. Sometimes I don’t realize how angry I am until someone else tells me they don’t think what that person did to me was okay. Or express shock at how I allowed them to talk to or treat me. Then I feel ashamed and angry. I have pretty low self worth despite being very outgoing and friendly. My low self worth keeps me from recognizing things I don’t like sometimes because I convince myself I’m actually the problem, and I have a passive, people pleasing communication style, often repressing my own emotions until they explode, so I feel like this has happened to me quite a bit over the years. 

Part of me knows I’m lacking empathy for them when I block them out. But it’s a response to what I perceive as their lack of empathy for me. So in that moment I feel they don’t genuinely care about me so it won’t hurt them if I disappear. (Which is not always true, often very untrue.) I just want to block the negative emotions they bring me because they’re too strong. I generally let things build up, I don’t realize until it’s the “final straw” and then I never want to speak to them again. I definitely demonize them in my mind which I know is unproductive. 

Usually later on I’ll be able to see them as neutral again and have more compassion for where they were in life that caused them to act the way they did. I’ve made amends with a few people who later reached out for forgiveness, or even I reached out after realizing some things (like projecting my complex emotions onto them) and apologize for abruptly cutting them out. 

But in the moment, it’s how I keep myself from going back to someone who has repeatedly made me question my own self worth/sanity. This is how I cope, and why I’m going to be so careful in the future about who I share my heart with. I’m finally learning to be emotionally vulnerable with myself and realize I value deep connections and have struggled because I sought after superficial ones for years to distract me from my own emptiness. Luckily I managed to find and keep some deep and genuine relationships. 

I just need to spend a lot of time on myself right now so I stop blindly heading into things without understanding what I want and need, and then getting upset when my needs aren’t met. I have been going through life looking to external validation to fill this giant void inside of me, I don’t want to do it anymore. It’s gotten to a point I feel I’ve been living to try to get validation from other people for so long I have no idea who I am. I’m struggling a lot with my sense of identity lately. It’s usually tied up in work, friends, or boyfriends. I don’t know who I am apart from people in my life and don’t know how to enjoy time alone like I used to. I want my joy and security to come internally. Just some late night thoughts, let me know if you have any to share"
I keep thinking my girlfriend is starting to fall out of love with me or not love me anymore,1,mfxwks,3,"My doctor told me I have bpd traits. I’m just wondering if this is a trait of bpd too? Like I keep overthinking and thinking back to how I acted and how I talked to her over the past few weeks or so and questioning if I was saying the wrong things or coming across in a way that would make her stop loving me as much. 

Things like her not sending me big long love notes like she did at the start of our relationship are getting to me and making me really paranoid that she doesn’t feel the same anymore. I have a meltdown last week over this and said to her that I feel like she loves me less or that I’m making her love me less and she assured me that wasn’t the case and stuff but I still have these feelings and it’s making me really depressed and just want to lie in bed all day."
Desperate to be healthy. Need a friend for support please.,1,mfxu0l,0,"I'm desperate to become healthier. My parents harass me and make me feel like shit for being unhealthy. I do want to get healthy but I need a positive friend to support me, so I know I'm not getting healthy because they bullied me into it, but because I want to be and support from my friend made it possible."
Why do people expect me to accommodate them but won’t do the same for me???,401,mezh2l,28,"People always ask me, why are you being so insensitive? Like, you don’t know what’s going on in people’s lives, think about the issues other people face in life. And they do this over the smallest things that others admit to doing as well.

But when people do it to me and I react in the same way, it’s always, you’re being over dramatic, your issues are all in your head? Why is it that I have to bend over backwards for everyone else but nobody will extend the same treatment to me? 

Everyone thinks that my issues are a choice, that I choose to be this way, but believe me if I can stop being suicidal at the drop of a hat I would be, but I can’t help it and nobody understands that they can’t simply talk me out of my disorder. 

I’m just so so angry because everyone tells me I’m a bad person, and honestly I’m not sure that I’m not a bad person at this point."
Feel bad when FP does stuff without you,2,mfs9it,2,"I always find myself getting upset and pushing my FP and all my friends away when my FP does stuff without me.

This could be small stuff like talking to new people, making new friends, being active online but won’t text me
.... or it can be bigger like they tell me how they are moving in with others and seeing them in a temporary relationship. 

I don’t want this to keep affecting our friendship and I feel so bad for thinking like this all the time. I care about them and I want them to be happy, so why am I so upset about them finding what makes them happy.

... is it my fear of abandonment and fear of people never being able to be happy with me?

I would love to know how others cope with splitting like this with their FP because it is so exhausting loving them and thinking they are the best person ever who loves being around you and cares about you... just to feel like they are evil and hate you the next day because you saw them do something without you."
Hypersexual with BPD,0,mfx8bu,1,I have hypersexual tendencies with my BPD and I don’t act on them. It’s so hard to control it but I’m proud to say I just want sex in a relationship because it’s love and validation
The Dr is spoke to said its highly likely I have bpd...,2,mfs54n,5,"But, he also suggested it could be cPTSD...I'm so confused! I also have 2 questions at the bottom, and I'm really hoping this kind of post is allowed , and I, so sorry if its not. I'm just confused and am looking for if anyone else has experienced this problem,..

Basically he said he's gonna send me some links for cPTSD and to look at them and then next week he'd call me again and discuss which one I feel like fits me better and go from there about getting a diagnosis...but on first look...BPD and cPTSD have similar symptoms and I related to a lot of them for both disorders. How to am I supposed to know which one is me? I guess the distinction is trauma, right? But I don't understand how the things I've been through even count as trauma but apparently I said things that made him think otherwise enough to suggest it? 

 Has anyone dealt with the same problem? Or does anyone know any symptoms that would distinguish the 2 enough that I can decide which one I think fits better?

Currently my gut is saying bpd, but what the Dr said has thrown me off and I'm so unsure

And question 2...what do I do now with a potential diagnosis? Do I tell people? Do I hide it? I'm kind of scared but also kind of want to know bc it will be a relief to know but also scared. Idk what's supposed to happen after a diagnosis of something or how I'm supposed to feel about it. Do I carry on as normal? Idk what to do with myself"
I’m more comfortable with people who don’t like me/are using me,2,mfs3s1,1,"DAE find themselves more comfortable when people you love don’t like you? When people like me, I get anxious. I constantly question it, and doubt it, and they have to prove themselves time and time again, repeatedly, forever, and it’s still not enough sometimes. It’s stressful, and it’s one of the main reasons I’ve switched to full on avoidant and stopped having social interactions altogether. I’ve had multiple times where I’ve straight up told people things like “if you just want to use me for money/an emotional punching bag/sex (even though I’m very asexual and hate sex)/whatever I don't mind, just let me know! 😊” because I feel like that would genuinely be easier for me.

I mean, I do like being liked by people, I really *really* do, the high parts of that high-low cycle feel amazing, but the lows are unbearable to the point where sometimes I feel like I’d rather just at least know where I stand. (Although I also get sad when they actually do just use me (which is especially silly because like obviously if you talk constantly about how easy you are to use people are going to end up using you? duh). It’s more secure and ""comfortable"", but it’s still disappointing.) The more it starts to look like a friend is using me for money, the less happy I am, but the less anxious I am too. If people refuse to let me buy them things I freak out, because then I feel like “well what can I bring to the table then? How am I supposed to be useful and prove my worth to you if I can’t buy you things?”

And I mean, the one relationship I’ve felt most secure in was one I *knew* with absolute certainty I was being used and manipulated. She lied and said she cared, but she was a bad liar, so I never stressed about whether or not it was true because I *knew* it wasn’t, and I never wondered whether I would mess up somehow and make her stop liking me because she never liked me in the first place. Our “romance” was basically transactional, so as long as I played my part and gave her the things that were expected of me then she’d have no reason to get rid of me. Even now, even after she betrayed me in one of the worst ways possible, I still miss that comfortable feeling sometimes.

Is this a BPD thing? Anyone else relate?"
I really need to stop buying new clothes whenever I start smth new,7,mfk8bv,1,"I’m starting a new course this week and I just dropped $200 on new clothes, a bunch of sweaters and some pants, bc starting a new thing means I have to start all over with a clean slate, I have to become a new person with a new style and I can’t have anyone know about the old me.

Anyone else have a similar problem? For me it’s anytime I start smth new, a new job, new course, anywhere where I’m going to meet new people I have to become a new person"
Police report on harassment,1,mfviv6,1,"I've finally made a report on an ex friend harassing me, after 4 months of constantly messaging me and blocking me and unblocking me, Guilting me, lying about having mymental illness to try and say I'm like here, copying my indetity, after making up lies and spreading them all over social media and slandering me I finally got the courage to file a police report and now I've got an appointment to discuss it and do something about it down at the station.


I'm still highly shaken and currently mid panic attack and crying both from fear and relief I guess, so I'm kind of asking for any helpful tips before I go as this is a very big thing for me and I am very scared, support will be helpful or any advice and kind words. Thank you."
Thank you Tiktok,0,mg4ugk,0,"For so long I've know something was wrong with me (m23) and I didn't know what it was. I don't really talk about it but the few times I have with others bipolar disorder kept coming up. I kept assuming I was bipolar because of my fluctuating mood but I never really aligned with all the symptoms. I didn't want to go to a doctor and get told I was bipolar and they be wrong or even worst to find out nothing was wrong with me or I'm a different type of mentally fucked up. 

Disclaimer I haven't been diagnosed nor do I have tiktok but I have made an appointment with a specialist to finally find out. I know self diagnosing is sorta looked down upon but I was and I still am in tears from learning more about bpd. I felt so close and so disconnected to bipolar disorder that I was too afraid to  even seek mental help. So often have I read an article about being bipolar and seen bpd and just completely ignored it because I ignorantly thought it was related to multi personality disorder so I'm thankful that tiktok has opened up more conversations on the issue. I'm sorry it's being glamorous but where there is darkness there is hope and I'm know I'm not the only one who no longer feels lost. 

I will keep you guys updated but if you have any advice as I go down this journey please share because I'm currently still alone in this even though I've found this wonderful community."
Identity problem,12,mfi4xd,1,"My emotions contain such strong things that it’s like someone else is taking control, like I’m dealing with different fricken personas. It annoys the hell out of me because when I’m healthy it’s not that much a problem but if I decline at all I start to no longer identify with my name and I start to “see” my other personas more prominently.

Moving in with my partner,1,mfv7ss,5,"I am moving in with my partner very soon and I am so nervous. I absolutely love them and I know that this is what I want. But I am so scared of making the next step in our relationship because that means that it will only hurt more if they leave me. My partner is usually pretty good at recognizing and helping me through my bpd episodes. I am just worried that it'll get annoying dealing with me everyday. I really fear that we'll turn into ""just roommates"" since I have heard that's what happens sometimes when  couples move in together. Don't get me wrong, I want to absolutely share my life with them but I am so scared of the power that I am giving them to hurt me. I trust them but shit happens.

Today my bf broke up with me,2,mfpzsg,0,"As the title suggests, today my bf of 1 year broke up with me. I don’t know why it hurts me so incredibly much even though we haven’t seen each other often and I haven’t talked to him in days. 
I understand why he did it, I kept sabotaging the relationship, kept breaking up with him and then begging him to take me back, but he’s finally had enough and I understand. But it hurts so damn much.
I can’t talk to friends because I already broke up with him last month and never told them we got back together. I don’t know what to do anymore, I just don’t understand why I’m this messy fucked up person. 
So if anyone could just tell me about their day it would be great. Or just tell me anything. Some fun fact, something funny, idc. Just anything to take my mind of things right now. Thanks💞"
I can’t stop getting mad at my boyfriend for liking other girls before me,6,mfjj1z,5,I hate thinking about the girls he used to like and getting mad at him for it. Today he admitted that he did like one of the girls I had asked him about but he told me it was the past. I get suicidal and began pinching myself as a way to hurt myself.

I absorb other peoples emotions and let it affect me,15,mfef33,8,"Hi guys. I’ve already posted so much on here but everyone is so nice. Anyway, tonight my boyfriend is angry and stressed because he did some paperwork wrong which has resulted in him not getting into uni. I’ve now done that thing where I take on his emotion and internalise it myself, meaning I’m now feeling angry and stressed and finding it hard to regulate my emotions. I also feel annoyed at him for not sorting this, even if that is unjust, I just wish he would be more independent with this stuff. Because I practically raised myself, I’m very independent (the raising myself thing also caused my BPD but that’s another story) and my boyfriend just isn’t, and because I love to give to people I care about and am eager to please, I do a lot of stuff for him. This time I didn’t and now he’s having a meltdown. I guess I’m just venting cos I’m stressed, but if anyone else ever gets this too it would be nice to know you relate."
What do you do when you start splitting on your SO?,8,mfh0ye,0,"I caught myself splitting today and was proud of myself for being able to identify what was going on. DBT says when anger isn’t justified to gently avoid and/or be a little nice. I ignored a couple of my partner’s texts and then told them that I needed some time to myself to work through some thoughts. My partner knows that I have BPD and is very understanding about my periodic need for seemingly unprompted timeouts.

I spent a few hours talking to one of my parents, grocery shopping and taking/editing pictures for my side hustle (pet photography). I felt better after a while and eventually okay enough to talk to them and see how their day was.

Even though I was diagnosed 5 years ago, I feel like today might be the first time I’ve ever fully realized what a splitting episode is. It isn’t permanent. I still love my partner. I hated them for a brief period of time. And then it was over and I was back to loving them again."
freaking out i hate my life,1,mfqyk3,0,"Tw: suicide
...
my best friend has started hanging out all the time with my roommate. it got to the point where whenever me and my friend were trying to chill together and we never could get any 1 on 1 time because my roommate was always butting in. then we'd be hanging out and my friend and roommate would just kind of ignore me when i would try to be a part of the conversation. and the past few days ive been not talking to wither of them. yesterday i almost blew up at my friend when he told me he loved me. i had to hold myself back bc i was crying and knew if i said more i was gonna start a bad fight. i just told him that i didnt fucking care and to leave me alone. i keep wanting to apologize, but when i try, i see them hanging out without me AGAIN. 
i've been feeling really replaceable and worthless lately and i told my friend this and right after telling him that all this shit started happening. like he didnt even care. 

i know i sound clingy and crazy af, but i just told my roommate a week or so ago that sometimes it feels like my best friend is my only friend bc i have a lot of friends, but none check in on me or are there for me when i need them like my best friend. we bonded over shared trauma and mental illness, so we've always like been there for each other. now i just feel so alone and sad and angry. i feel like my roommate is trying to replace me in my life. like whats the point of me even being alive if she can just come around and kick me out of my friendships and support system. 

i know i sound delusional and i'm probably just being crazy for no reason and its the bpd talking, but i just fucking hate her i want to scream at both of them i want to snap. i want them to know what theyre doing to me. 

i'm so tired of caring about people so much more than they care about me. i just want to feel like i belong somewhere or like someone gives a fuck about me.

my birthday is in 3 days and i can't spend another year alone crying, but thats how its looking. i just want to be dead. i dont care anymore i dont want to live. theres no fixing my life, theres no reason for me to keep living on this earth in pain."
Setting boundaries with mother?,13,mfeu5h,4,"Hey everyone. I'm finding it extremely hard to articulate boundaries to my mother despite explaining them to her for years. Unfortunately, this sometimes causes me to react with significant anger when she violates my boundaries. She behaves in a way which negates my personal space, privacy, emotions, and achievements. (giving away my things while I'm out of the house, minimizing my concerns, lying about things I've never agreed to/ said to third parties, saying things like ""I made you, you'd be nothing without me"" etc.) Currently, I am not in a position to move out. I constantly feel unheard, pressured and disrespected. Is there a way in which I can approach her differently about this?"
Currently struggling.,1,mfqr41,0,"I have been struggling with how I have been feeling for the past 2 weeks. I have spoken to the Dr's and they want me to go back onto my meds (escitalopram and seroquel). I really don't want to go back on my meds but given how I am currently feeling I guess I probably should. I just don't want to feel tired/emotion-less zombie all of the time.

I also have never had any symptoms of BPD explained to me, I was just given a diagnosis and no real way to deal with my symptoms. I eat well, exercise regularly and try to keep a consistent routine but always seem to end up feeling like this"
How can we go about finding a healthy relationship?,1,mfqnq5,3,"I am feeling seriously defeated today. I took a year off of dating to try and find happiness on my own and I found the old me, from years ago, who loved to find small towns and get a coffee. Drive to no where to take pictures. Find cute stores. Explore. I found new friends, ditched some toxic ones. I read a LOT. I finally felt ready. 

I found what I thought would be good where I least expected it: a friendship. We started getting friendly, then got physical, and I wasn't really sure what I wanted at first. I wanted to take it slow as hell, and it was going that way for a bit until something felt uneasy. I decided to lurk a bit and while I couldn't point to a ""fact"" before last night, I thought there was someone else. Last night it was confirmed after he was going to see his cousin that he was in fact seeing a girlfriend of three years that, in our 10 year friendship, he never mentioned once. I am sick to my stomach. Besides the fact that it destroys a foundation of friendship by cutting off trust, how disrespectful after having a talk about unprotected sex to LIE. He knows I have been working on some of my own issues, he knows my past relationship issues, and he played me like the rest of them. and SO smoothly. I am working on how I should cut it off now, if I should even tell the girl, etc.

But this is a freaking pattern. My last ex was a chronic cheater, refused to commit, and treated me like trash. Before that, I had an abusive relationship with a guy who constantly threatened me, made me work for his approval and if I did any less than 120% I would hear about it. There was also the drunk who cheated on me for the last half of our relationship. The guy who blamed my lack of religion on why our relationship went no where only for him to marry a girl from a different background.

I went around for years thinking I was unlovable. It really got hard and I did get desperate. I finally felt like I wasn't desperate, that I was looking for love in a right place, and instantly end up with another story for the books. I would have been okay if he hadn't lied to my face, if maybe he just refused to see me or sleep with me or even cut me off, but he is creating a whole false narrative. WTF!

I think I have to break from dating again. What the hell am I doing wrong? Why am I dragging these people in? I thought I found love in myself and I feel a lot more confident, but I am getting walked over, again."
How to overcome intrusive/obsessive thoughts,5,mfige5,3,"I've had a very rough day, I won't go into details, but a situation regarding my ex has sent me into a spin. Its been causing increasingly bad intrusive thoughts and obsessing about the situation 

I cant sleep, every time I put my head down and try and think about something else it comes back. This happens for me regularly but its super bad today and already been taken home by the police once. The thoughts are just causing me pain and making it really difficult not to give in to the intrusions 

Any coping strategies for clearing mind when these thoughts keep surfacing? I really need some help"
Need help,1,mfp9rh,0,"This may be a trigger for some people idk 
Hi i havent posted here before, but i guess i just need some advice... or support maybe, im struggling to keep pushing right now, i lost both my sons years ago as babies and when i eventually recovered i just put all my energy and emotion into getting and keeping my horse, but its been getting harder and harder and i havent actually done my horse myself in months, i can barely leave the house and when i do make it to the yard i manage maybe half an hour of work before i have a list longer than my arm of things that need fixing or replacing or that have gone missing and the stress sends me into a breakdown, i dont drive either so my mum will sit there and refuse to take me home until i finish, but i dont manage to finish, all that happens is i have a breakdown in front of everyone then no one will talk to me, no one will ride with me and ive been kicked off 5 yards in the space of a year before, i dont want much out of my life anymore, i dont expect a normal life, i just want to be able to enjoy one thing"
Friendships and FPs - I want one to stay,0,mfp0ki,2,"I don't know if this is really an FML post or Relationships (maybe even vent). 

I'm a 43 year old male, diagnosed about 2 years. With the benefit of hindsight I now recognize I have had a series of FPs throughout my life. 

The first one that really stuck was my ""best friend"" in high school. I went through a couple I'm not proud of including a coworker I had an affair with. Not knowing the strong feelings were partly because of mental illness. 

I don't want to turn this into a novel. I don't understand how friendships are to work. Basics like how often to talk. How to not be the one reaching out all the time 

I miss being someone else's FP. I wish my wife were my FP, it would make life so much easier. 

I have one IRL friend left that I went to high school with. The remaining acquaintances are all people like the partners of my wife's friends. I have a few online friends, but only one I can confide in about almost everything. 

I think this is a vent. I'll stop here. 

TL/DR guy throws pity party about friendships"
Sad Realization,8,mfec6u,3,"I have realized that I will probably be my own fate. I struggle with suicidal ideation, and often at the slightest issue or uncomfortable feeling my mind wanders to the thought of suicide. I have made about 3 attempts total that landed me in the hospital, and other close calls. Just last week I was ready to kill myself, I had it all planned out and i managed to snap out of it when I couldn’t breathe, but still.

When I calm down I don’t want to die, I want to be here, but when I get upset it feels like suicide is the only option. If it weren’t for my mom hiding my meds I might not even be here, even if I don’t really want to die. It’s just in those moments I don’t know what will make it all go away and everything feels just utterly unbearable. I always come down and the emotions pass but my brain doesn’t realize or understand that it will pass. It makes me wonder if there will come a day where I get the impulsive urge to end my life and it will end up being the death of me, even if I really didn’t want to die. 

I fear one day I won’t be able to stop myself or I’ll get into an emotional frenzy where all rational thinking goes out the window, I had a very close call last May where that almost happened. It feels like my fate is to end up killing myself the question just becomes... when?

Idk if this makes any sense or if anyone else can relate, I know I can’t be alone because this is such a huge part of BPD but still."
I've made mistakes in my past I can't get past.,8,mfelzl,3,"Because I went undiagnosed with BPD for so long, I made mistakes in my teen years and twenties, like hanging out with unstable, toxic people, who ended up making my life hell in my adult life. Even though I've cut these peoole out of my life long ago, the memories and traumas of the past still haunt me to this day. I have a single friend (who is more like my care taker at this point), a great psychotherapist, but no family or anyone else to confide in or hang out with. I have developed this agoraphobia recently and I get panicked at the thought of leaving the house by myself. Additionally, when I actually do leave the house, I can only be out for short periods before a panic or anxiety starts to rise in my chest, like everyone is staring at me or judging me. Ive tried seeking friends online, but its not the same. What should I do?"
Helpful approach for me to not act on emotion,49,mf2iqw,6,"Edit: Thanks for the award kind person! I’ve found the S.T.O.P. approach helpful when feeling out of control and wanting to act on emotion. It’s simple but it really takes effort to make yourself do it every time.

S-Stop

T-Take a step back from the emotion for a minute
 
O-Observe the situation like a fly on the wall. What are the facts only, without any judgment? 

P-Proceed with mindfulness. Proceed taking into account what the facts are instead of the emotion attached.

Example, an argument starting to happen with my partner.

S-Stop interaction

T-Ask myself to back away from the emotion for a second 

O-notice he’s scrunching his brow, he’s sighing 

P-I need to leave the room and give both of us some space until we calm down

I’ve found that shutting down an emotional response when I feel it happening keeps it from escalating and feeding itself into a frenzy."
Is there ever a way off the rollercoaster?,4,mfhxvx,1,"I know it's terrible, but I also don't know how to not be on a constant rollercoaster ride. After years of failed relationships and broken hearts and more reckless adventure than I can even remember (partially due to trauma memory gaps) I'm really at the end of what feels like a very long train. Maybe its the front. Who knows. I don't even know if I want off the ride? Or if I could? I feel as tho all I have left is abunch of sad stories that people who don't live like this enjoy and the sad loneliness of never having felt at home in any of it. What is look at as a reckless abandonment for freedom and life has actually been a desperate attempt at finding a home, within myself and on this planet. Or maybe everyone sees me as I am and I'm the only one thats missing the point. Who can say, but I know that I'm fucking tired. Abandon them all and no one can abandon you, abandon yourself and find that there's nothing to hold and that's just terrible.

I hope all of us that are fucking tired can find some rest and acceptance."
Feeling extra swag today,29,mf62n5,6,"It is now warm out, which is amazing to me. The swamp is starting to blossom, and soon all the trees will be green. I’m out here doing my job, which is the best job in the world.

How you doing?,5,mfewvh,5,"Hello everyone, I feel quite down today but don’t feel like want to talk about it. And feels like need a bit of distraction.

I wish I could just stop feeling,6,mfgmoo,2,"I’m never going to be capable of loving someone in a normal way or the way that they deserve so I’m just going to keep hurting people. And honestly, I don’t like how having a FP makes me feel most of the time but I literally can’t control it. Maybe I should just move to the woods and never make contact with another human again. My current FP doesn’t realize how terrible a person I am (or that he’s my FP for that matter) and it’s only a matter of time before I scare him off. I honestly would rather have no emotions at all than this constant rollercoaster."
I want to disappear forever,3,mfirrx,0,"It’s one of those nights where I wish I never existed. I hate the fact that we are still in covid times. I feel like it just makes my symptoms flair up. Today I had a meltdown because I couldn’t lift a piece of furniture at the store and there was no one to help me. It’s little things like these that just make me feel so alone. It the kind of snowball effect that just reminds me that I’m. It worthy of friends or people being genuinely nice to me. 
I want to die because I feel like the biggest burden on anyone I meet. I feel unworthy of love. Unworthy of genuine friendships. Starting to feel like I wasn’t meant to exist. 
I don’t want to cry anymore. I just want the suffering to stop. I want to get rid of debts and fix everything inside my head but I feel like nothing helps. 
To make matters worse my engine gave out after having my car for two years. 

I’m sick and tired of the world placing all these obstacles in my path. Why does my 2 year old car have to break down so fast? Why does my boyfriend ignore me when I need constant attention? Why does my family tell me to be normal? 

It feels like every day the odds are against me and I don’t see that as a reason to keep on living."
Teddy bear sign,4,mfkfat,5,"I just recently read about the ""teddy bear sign"" that some mental health journals have mentioned as a potential sign of BPD. Essentially, adults with BPD get stuck in the phase of childhood when they are supposed to be transitioning out of needing objects as a form of comfort (teddy bear, blanket, doll, etc) and so these objects continue to be a significant form of comfort for an adult with BPD even in their latter years. 

What's odd to me is the object has basically been classified as something that someone with BPD uses as a relationship substitute. Something not attached to another person, but an entire entity on its own.

My experience with this objects is exactly the opposite. All of my stuffed animals that I have extreme attachment to are from someone very important to me and I actually consider that stuffed animal as that person themselves. (That's the best way I can describe it, no I don't *actually* think that person IS the stuffed animal but I equate it to them specifically.) Exp: I have a stuffed animal from my grandma and it's her. I have one from my brother and it is him. One from my husband and it's the same thing there. 

I guess, in my head, I made it this way so that I would always have access to them and always have them with me. And in past relationships when it has ended, I've thrown everything they've ever given me away, including any comfort items so I don't hold onto them if the relationship dissolves. 

Anyone else have an experience with this?"
Got a text from someone telling me that after I told them I had BPD and it’s hard for me to trust people that they looked it up and that’s when the “dots connected.” :/,6,mfe03p,4,"He was someone that I was interested in and I thought the feeling was mutual until he told me he still had feelings for his ex and I asked him if I was just a fuck toy until he found someone better and he said “not necessarily” which to me felt like “maybe/probably” which to me felt like “yes.” 
So I got inebriated and kind of unleashed. Said some horrible things that I deeply regret because I’m pathetic and can’t handle being rejected. 
I kept asking him to just block me. I was trying to hurt his feelings. I was trying to push him away but he just kept reassuring me which made me feel worse. I said, why won’t you block me? And he just said cause I only block bad people and you’re a good person. What about me makes him think I’m a good person. I deliberately tried to hurt his feelings because I felt bad for myself. 
When he made the comment about how it made sense that I had BPD I told him, if there’s anything you take from your experience with me it’s to please not make any generalizations about people with BPD. I told him I’m a person, not my disorder and it’s gross for him to make an assumption about everyone with BPD based on one experience. That it’s becoming much more relevant in the mental health community, and someone he knows and loves probably has it, and are scared to talk about it because of being stigmatized like that. 
I said most of us are brilliant, charismatic, beautiful, outgoing thinkers n we don’t want pity, we just want to be understood. 
I’m sick of telling people I struggle with this disorder just to either be treated like the “life of the party” or a charity case. 
I’m sorry this post was all over the place I just needed to fucking vent. Thanks 4 ur time"
Quiet bpd getting loud,0,mfn5ri,12,"TW: mentions of negative stereotypes that society associates with bpd.

Okay so I’m 19F and I have bpd, I got diagnosed with bpd when I was around 17. But I guess you could say I existed/exist on the more quiet end of the spectrum. What I mean to say is that I’m mostly “functional” or whatever and I often don’t have explosive episodes, i implode. My thought patterns can be erratic and all of that but I’m not expressive. Anyway I’ve read a lot on bpd and there’s a lot of negative attributes that most people associate with bpd and I think a part of me internalized all of those. To the point where when I mention I have bpd i often say “but I’m not the typical borderline, I’m like normal mostly” which is really messed up of me but I guess I just want to dissociate myself from the disorder as much as I possibly can. The truth is though I think my bpd is becoming less quiet. And i find myself doing things that are the stereotypical negative things that society associates with bpd. And it’s like I’m watching myself completely obliterate my relationships and manipulate people and I’d even go as far as to say be emotionally abusive and I can’t stop myself. It’s almost like someone else is doing all of those things but that person is me. I’m holding myself accountable and everything but at the same time it’s hard because I’m supposed to be getting better but instead I feel like I’m getting worse. I just don’t really know what do anymore and it’s like no one in my life sees me/gets it. So I’m probably just going to detach from everyone and self-isolate."
Feel like they forgot something terrible from their childhood on purpose?,21,mf6l1e,15,"I have this really terrible feeling that something bad happened to me as a kid like I show signs of trauma but I can’t tell if this feeling is correct and I just repressed whatever has happened, or if I’m down playing the bad things that happened in my childhood and want a bigger reason for the trauma to feel like my bpd is valid.  Does anyone else feel like this? I’m like stuck between validating what I went through and feeling like it wasn’t “enough” to cause bpd¿ and  on top of it I like drown in this sinking feeling that something bad happened. If anyone related please let me know or if you have a reason why you think I feel like this."
SO shuts me out or feel annoyed when I tell him I am suicidal.,1,mfm8hd,2,"Apologize for my grammar or spelling in advance.

I have been denying this fact for a loooong time. But I have to accept and acknowledge that it is one of my triggers.

He thinks that just because I am suicidal and not thankful I am alive and breathing = not happy/ satisfied with our relationship.

I am happy with our relationship, it's one of the reasons why I try so so hard to better myself, to accept myself radically and be mindful of my actions, it has been so hard the first few months, I have to admit, I've been toxic just to get reassurance from him. IT'S hard as hell to contradict these core values in my head that I grew up in, to be kind to myself, to unlearn the defense mechanisms I have learned because of my past, it's hard af and I know you guys here understand this. 

My SO may not be perfect, there's flaws in our relationship, there's things he might say and I get triggered but he says sorry and now always takes caution in every single word he says, but sometimes I just break, I just forget my reason in life, I don't see any future in it, I feel hopeless, ultimately I feel like death is the ultimate answer, no matter how hard I try, I sometimes go back to this and whenever I try to communicate this to my SO, I get coldness and being shut off, he thinks I don't want him in my life, that US is not enough for me to continue living. I love him and our relationship, but sometimes I fail and go back into my old thinking and I just want him to be there and meet me and not just walk away and leave me. I feel abandon whenever he does that and just brings back lots of bad stuff. He tells me that he loves me for being vulnerable but the truth is I only told him about my past, just the surface, the reasons why I am the way I am, and he lovingly accepted it and he was wonderful. But the real emotions that came with it? How I hate I have ever been born? How I'm never really thankful I'm breathing or how I'm suicidal... I chose not to cause I think it will just throw me off my progress, but I wish he would acknowledge it, that the girl he's loving comes with these issues too, that I can be happy with our relationship and have mental issues at the same time, I just want him there when I want to end myself but I am met with a cold shoulder and a back turned against me. 

I am planning to tell him this at once, but I am torn as to how I should open up with it as I have been really bad with communicating my vulnerable and true feeling with him as I am afraid he'll turn out cold."
BFF has a new BF,3,mfh34r,1,"
My best friend just started dating this guy and I feel like I’m already being replaced. I’m so happy for her and I want her relationship to work. This guy is super kind and he cares about her a lot but he’s all she talks about now. I know it’s the excitement of a new relationship, I’ve been there. I’m just not used to it coming from her. She’s super independent. She’s been seeing him 2 or 3 times a week. We live together and I know I can’t demand all of her time but we were just watching a show together. We watch the new episode every week. No cheating and watching it by ourselves first. Well she left in the middle to go to his place. So now I’m sitting in my living room alone feeling abandoned. I feel like I’m being left behind. Like I’m losing my best friend. She’s the only long term non family relationship that I’ve had that’s lasted. I know I’m being irrational but I’m spiraling and I have no one to talk to."
None of my normal grounding methods are working,5,mff6ov,2,"I’ve been in a constant dissociative spell for around 24 hours and I don’t really know what to do.

How do you deal with your birthday without drug binging or self harming,8,mfae5s,3,"This is a new for me. I'm turning 27 which is a special age for me. I told myself I was supposed to have achieved what I wanted in life by this time and that there was no meaning in living past this age. Which furthers adds to desire to get shitfaced and/or selfharm right now. 

I can meditate, keep myself busy, etc. I can't handle impulsivity despite experience. I've preemtively removed myself from being near substances and I'm surrounded by my parents but I hate them.

I caught my bf/fp cheating and idk what to do,0,mfk5dl,3,"(I'm a 22 y/o woman with bpd in a relationship with a 23 y/o man w/o bpd)

Yesterday night before work, I was feeling insecure like I have been the past couple of weeks in my relationship. We have just been bickering over the slightest things and he is always talking to me with a condescending tone of voice as of lately. He has also suddenly started acting weird, examples: I was majorly insecure one day and ""jokingly"" asked if he was cheating on me. He got super mad and I ended up feeling guilty. Then one night he went out with his best friend and didn't text me when he made it. So hours go by and I texted and asked what he was doing and he got mad and sent me a picture of him out to eat with his friend. He told me he doesn't want me checking up on him, that it's crazy, that he isn't obligated to do that and it turned into a full blown argument and so on. So, back to the point, last night he left his phone in the bathroom and I went in there to shower. I had a gut feeling to go through it so I did. I saw messages on his snapchat between this girl. In November of 2020, he commented on her snapchat story of her in a bra and said ""Thank you 😊"". And in December, he was asking her what her kid wanted for christmas as if he was going to buy her kid something.... It gets worse for me... then no saved messages at all until this month on the 7th, She posted a snap sorry of her all dressed up with a friend and he slid up on it and commented ""my forever crush"" and she replied ""thanks boo, the feeling is mutual"" and then he sent a heart and infinity emoji. A week after that he tried messaging her again saying hey which she either did not respond or messages weren't saved. I took pictures of them and sent them to my two closest friends for advice. I confronted him about it, I ended up leaving our apartment together to go see my best friend and he blew my phone up all night. I eventually went back to our apartment bc I intended on leaving him. I know it's not as bad as it could be but to me sneaky flirtatious messages can eventually lead to more! and I didn't want to put myself through the possibility of that happening. When i got home, he was frantic and crying, begging me to stay. He said that he hasn't seen her since high school and I even messaged this girl on my phone and she confirmed what he said. He has now deleted every social media except snapchat which he has removed EVERY girl. I did not even ask for that. I didn't want him to do anything bc I was going to leave. He promised to work on gaining my trust back, always checking up with me and so on. I'm sorry this is so long, I just needed to rant and get advice! I have no idea what to do! I feel stuck. I love this boy so much but I am just so hurt and betrayed. I don't know if things will ever be the same. I don't want to leave him but how can I trust him? I don't know what to do here and would love some outside input. :("
Wow this disorder is a curse,22,mf2hsn,7,"The worst part of bpd for me is the inability to apply theoretical knowledge you have like:

* how to not destroy your life
* how to do what people ask you to
* how to behave to help yourself
* why are you like this and what are the mechanisms that sabotage your life, how to prevent them

in practice.

&#x200B;

I know almost everything about that in theory. I am unable to put it into practice, implement them. It's like a wall between them... People rely on me and I just can't get it right. Feels like I'm blind, stumbling around in the dark, grasping at a correct solution by luck. 

Actually if I had more adversities, if I wouldn't be so tremendously lucky in the department of money, intelligence, looks, some family members and friends, I would be completely doomed. Momentous luck is what allows me to live, not my work. I've never achieved anything and I don't think I've ever worked for anything, I mean really work like put my soul into it. I don't know how.

I can't see my dysfunctional mechanisms when I'm about to use them again; only after. After is always to late. I'm no help to anyone in any capacity whatsoever. I don't really touch this world, I won't leave my imprint on it. I'm an idea of a person that was never put to practice or test. Never lived her life."
"How Do You Define the Concept of ""Processing your Emotions?"" (Question and Venting)",2,mfg6w3,0,"I'm so sorry for my super long post. I didn't mean for it to be anywhere near this long!

Basically have been so messed up mentally and I've been in therapy steadily for about ten years now. (I'm 31) Also, I have tried DBT Therapy (I had to quit because they didn't accept insurance and they were EXPENSIVE! I loved that therapist though; I wish he had been a regular psychologist) I have tried outpatient treatment at a hospital, I have done soooo many things.

I have also tried lots of different medications, I've had to suffer from heavy withdraws from some of those, and I'm actually having a vagus nerve stimulator implanted in my body in a few days! I had to do A LOT of screening, tests, background, etc and I have tried and been unsuccessful in at least 4 different types of therapy, so I was a candidate. (It's part of a study where the product has already been approved by the FDA several years ago & it's from Germany where they have great healthcare. The study is to convince insurance companies in the US to pay for it, if that makes sense)

I feel so alone. I've had a lot of deaths in the family recently and my cat that I have had since I was sixteen recently passed too. That was the worst. She was my best friend and mini me. When I would have panic attacks, she would climb on my back and lay there steadily until I calmed down) I could go on and on, but my cat Eleanor was everything to me.  I've never been more isolated (COVID or not) I'm starting to see myself age for the first time from the stress and the mental agony. (I have always looked incredibly young for my age, I've been asked by doctors even when I was 28, if I was ""still a minor."") 

I'm becoming less prone to any kind of human touch whatsoever. It scares me. I live with my mom and I feel so guilty that she has to deal with me and that I'm not someone she can be proud of career or accomplishment wise. At the same time, she is also mentally ill from my biofather's extreme abuse and between that and my BPD (and my resentment that she didn't get me out of that abusive home) makes us fight constantly. We used to be so close in my 20's, but I honestly can't stand her now, but I still feel bad & guilty because she doesn't have to let me and my sick dog (that she also helps pay for) in her house. I feel so hollow, yet I have the world on my shoulders at the same time. I was always okay being alone, but now that I'm 31 (and I don't tell anyone I know this) I fear that due to my nature & my age, I'll never get to do normal things like get married and have a family. I NEVER did normal growing up.

I even looked into EMDR therapy (and I still haven't ruled that out) but people say how it helps you process your trauma. what does that even mean??? I don't know what that means, so how do I know if I'm doing it properly, or even at all? I've tried EVERYTHING any therapist has recommended, spent more than I can afford, try/tried yoga and meditation techniques.  I am VERY open about what I experienced as child/teen (severe abuse) I have an excellent long term memory and I can easily talk about or deconstruct events, former or current emotions, etc. But I hear also that ""medicine and xyz can help BPD symptoms, but you have to learn how to process your trauma in order to heal."" But again, what does that entail?"

"Trying to care for my wife. Need advice, TW: self harm, suicidal ideation",8,mf80d4,14,"Hi r/BPD

I’m trying to figure out what I can do to help my wife right now. 

We got into a fight last night and it was bad. I won’t go into details but she was having suicidal ideation pretty hard. We’ve since made up and she isn’t in danger right now I’m just trying to figure out how to give her care after the fact. 

She was talking about how she’s too cowardly to do it any other way than instantaneously. She was running around with a hammer for a while. How she didn’t want to jump off of anything or take any pills in case it didn’t work properly. It was terrifying. 

She called a friend to talk to who eventually said they had to call back. And when they didn’t call back she lost it. She ended up cutting her leg with glass shards before I could stop her. RIP bathroom door. 

Aside from the obvious support and psychiatric help that she needs what can I do to help her the morning after. 

Any of you here that have self harmed what did you wish someone would do or know or ask afterwards? What did you wish your partner would do that would help you feel better when you wake up and realize what you had done to yourself and were sad? 

Please she’s the love of my life and I can’t bear to see her in pain like this. I just want to help somehow and I’m so lost. I can’t comprehend the mindset and so I’m having trouble figuring out what I can even do. 

The wounds weren’t deep, luckily...."

Does anyone get night terrors from bad switches,1,mfiohp,1,"I have been stuck in a bpd episode for months and I just had a long scary ass weird dream I'm going to write it here

I went to my old neighborhood, really nice houses. Before I left some woman walked out and was talking to me, she had 2 boys with her and invited me over so I went iddk why. To get up to their house they had a weird obstacle course thing like hanging hammocks? Super not safe. When I got to the second one her son was on it so it flipped and we fell from a far ass height and I passed out on the ground

I woke up in their house with their whole family being there? No one was hurt but they kept taunting me and being rude so I wanted to leave. Which means I had to wrangle the stupid hammocks. They were suddenly having a bday party so a fuck ton of kids were on it so it was taking forever to get down because I didn't want to flip again

A girl kept fucking touching me. Like grabbing my ass and my leg, I kept telling her to stop. I finally got down and when I walked to my car fucking dogs were running at me. Which morphed into fucking zoo animals I was standing next to a lion and a tiger. Some noise went off and I stood so fucking still and they finally wandered off. Suddenly I woke up at home in bed

I woke up feeling AWFUL, almost like I was hungover and drunk/high at the same time. And it was 455 in the afternoon so I was shocked, I remember going to bed and I was panicking that the people drugged me. I looked in the mirror and my teeth were cracked and bleeding, the blood vessels in my eyes were broken, I was so scared I ran to my mom crying and she was like wtf, I showed her my teeth and she looked confused so I touched one and realized they were fine and I finally woke up.

Im sweating. Im scared. Im sad."
Ketamine and BPD questions,1,mfil8k,1,"Hi, I usually lurk around here time to time when scrolling through reddit but wanted to get some input on my upcoming treatment.

My psychiatrist and I came to the conclusion that ketamine might be the best treatment option since all prior medicine plans fell through, and with my history of experimenting with psycadelics of various forms and degrees with good and bad experiences that it would be worth a shot.

Like I stated previously, I've dabbled with various forms of psycadelics. The most extreme in which was dmt which to my knowledge and understanding I went through an acute form of 'ego death' which helped me move past a suicidal ideology I had. Without getting to in depth about said event, I've experienced my fair share of experiences with said things, but there's always a slight anxiety of going into said mind state. I've heard here and there of various experiences with said treatment, and was curious if anyone has any information on how it went for them and what to expect from it.

What I know so far is I'll be administered 6 doses across 2 weeks to begin with therapy sessions intertwined with each appointment, then set on a more loose schedule depending on the effects. I am curious on how that compares to others, and what it was like for you going into it, during and what your results are and maybe even how far along some of you are with it.

Any information is welcome, and I'm very grateful for any help provided. I wish you all the best with your struggles and always remember to keep getting back up because. Thanks!"
I've realized why hanging out with more than 1 person at a time is so tiring for me after being almost 30,36,meym81,4,"Can't play two very different people at the same time. I micromanage every interaction, even the interaction within the group. Can't be in social interactions of more than 5 people, that's where brawling and fighting always happen guaranteed.

I've read this is called ""mirroring"". But in me this goes in hand with deceipt and manipulation. And my purposes are always centered towards my gratification, and feeling stable is gratification for me. So it's justifeable in my eyes to be like this if I'm not harming anyone else."
Original Trauma,3,mfcs23,2,"Until I was a late teen I had this sense that something traumatic had happened to me. It was the only thing that made sense to explain my anger, my fear of abandonment, and so on and so forth.

One day my suspicions were confirmed when I took a sneak peek in the diaries my father kept from the time that my mother left him to a few months after their divorce was decreed. I got to one evening's entry and before me were the opening details of one of their post-separation fights. I knew this fight. My father's words matched my memories of this night, before and after the event which was to change my life like no other could. That event was my mother's attempt to murder me with a pair of scissors.

After discovering this horror, I dissociated for about an hour and then, for decades, pretended, hoped, and pleaded with myself that my mother must have been really messed up with drugs and that was the reason for the attack. Although another decade and a half would pass before I got my BPD diagnosis, I knew this event was responsible for all those BPD symptoms I had been experiencing. Undoubtedly, I have some degree of untreated PTSD, too.

About a year ago, my father, from his death bed gave me the whole story. I requested this. My mother had previously stated to him that I was no longer what she wanted as a child, and that she was going to do something about that. That night, she hurled a rock or brick through a patio door to gain access to our townhouse, and she burned my father's arm with a cigarette to get him to release me. The scar he had on his arm was significant, so I believe him when he said he tried his best to hold onto me as best he could, but the pain was too much. She got ahold of me and held me hostage for around an hour while local police negotiated with her. She made a motion to stab me in the neck, but one of the officers leapt at her (and me) and rolled her off my, saving my life. Despite this, she wasn't charged -- it was 1971 and attitudes may have been different (I'm not sure).

To this day, the memory of being taken hostage and my mother attempting to murder me are well surpressed, though I have vivid memories of that night before and after the attack. I even remember sitting in a police car, chatting with the dispatcher as the officer worked the radio for me.

I think the memory supression is a good thing. And I hate my mother."
Studying.,3,mfcpgm,3,"I got this really important exam in not less than a month, and if small stuff already get me too anxious, this one feels like my life will end. I decided to vent here, in hope of support, maybe, after a really bad anxiety attack. 

Studying with BPD is hell, and it's not even an excuse to perform less, because the system will not give you credits for all those depressif episodes when you couldn't even find purpose to waking up, or the mania one where you couldn't calm your ass, searching for other more interesting ideas and discovering new hobbies you never knew had. 

And no, I can't just brush it off and think about all the other solutions that I have if I ever don't pass, I feel like I will fail my life if I don't get a score that will get me to a good university. (for french people, if you're here, you might know les classes préparatoires mp, that's what I'm talking about).

so if someone got any advice for a poor soul just trying to live without feeling like a complete failure, they're more than welcomed to do so."

Is anyone else baffled by normal people's lack of mood swings?,627,meix34,62,"I find myself getting impatient when someone gets in to a bad mood and they don't snap out of it the way I do.

"BPD is so weird bc I'll go through the most intense episode with a full mental breakdown and a plan of killing myself, then 30 minutes later I'm scrolling past memes and giggling",1425,ab59hg,96,
The reality of BPD,1400,dspuar,164,"Borderline Personality Disorder isn’t being cute and ‘clingy’ and ‘adorably needy’. Being with (romantic or otherwise) someone with BPD isn’t akin to taking care of a pet. BPD isn’t an ‘aw it’s so endearing that they need me so badly’ type of thing. 

BPD is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and it’s not easy to diagnose. You don’t just decide you have it, just like you don’t decide you’re depressed because you had a bad  day, or you don’t decide you’re bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes. Believe  me, you don’t want it.

BPD is turning nothing into everything, is knowing you’re being irrational and not being able to stop regardless, is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person you’re talking to into having to take care of you when they really don’t want to.

It’s thinking someone doesn’t care about you anymore because they made a new friend. It’s automatically registering new people as a threat. It’s a fear of abandonment and rejection that’s damn near omnipresent. It’s being able to shift from ‘I love you so much!’ to ‘I don’t give a fuck, I hate you, I don’t even want to talk to you’ and back at the drop of a hat.

It’s finding identity in a drastic hair change, and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out. It’s seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are. It’s waking up and trying to be a new person every day. Go vegan, go goth, go hipster, go glamour, cut your hair, change your makeup, gain weight, lose weight, and never feel quite there. Ever.

It’s comprehending ‘love’ as ‘pity’ and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection. It’s regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously NEEDING to get it out. It’s wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someone’s arms because, at least then, they don’t have to clean your wounds for you. They won’t hate you. They won’t be annoyed. 

It’s the constant battle, every time you get upset, of, “Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about? What is more abusive, talking about this or hiding it? If I tell them I’ll bring them down and I’ll guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault. If I don’t, I’m a disgusting liar, I’m manipulative, I’m untrustworthy.”

It’s wondering if you’re faking your symptoms. It’s disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days. It’s feeling like you aren’t real, and then wishing you weren’t. It’s fear, a lack of self, and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times. It’s trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself. It’s feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because, whoops, you’re being manipulative."
"Not to brag, but I haven’t had a mood swing in, like, 7 minutes.",1240,azbcxp,62,
Why is it everyone so “mental health awareness” until they see a person with bpd,1234,lp5b5n,174,"Obviously they support us on the surface, but the minute we tell a dumb a lie, or have an episode, then we’re crazy and toxic. i will NEVER get this, these girls from my old town bullied me off social media because I was crying for no reason, but all of them are supposed to be activists for those with mental illness. News flash: you are not an mental health activist if you can’t take the good with ugly.
edit: I am not saying you can’t stop a friendship with someone with bpd because they are being manipulative or they are lying, i’m just saying, lying, manic episodes, and other “ugly” things could be traits of person with bpd, and if you call your self a mental health advocate, you have to advocate for help with those parts too. (:"
I got told I don’t meet the criteria for BPD anymore. I want to share how I did it.,1207,e3eytd,94,"Hi everyone! This is my first post ever. 

I’m just going to dive right in. I was diagnosed in 2014 when I was about to turn 20. I’m 25 now, so this was a fairly long process. 

The mental health system is shit. I was simply told my diagnosis and sent on my way. No further input, just years on waiting lists. I decided “fuck it”, and I decided to develop my own recovery plan. 

I read the list of symptoms and I took a note of them. For a whole month, I kept a log of my symptoms. 

What symptom occurred? What triggered it? How did you respond? How did affect the other person? How did your response affect you? How can you respond better next time? 

I noticed I had 3 major symptoms that occurred more frequently than others. 

Fear of abandonment.
Unstable relationships.
Unclear sense of self. 

I decided these were the most important symptoms to tackle. My fear of abandonment was intense to the point I would physically grab a person and beg them to stay, threatening to harm myself. It was manipulative, but it was a knee-jerk reaction. 

I read about the symptom and managed to identify what caused it. My dad was unreliable and was in and out of my life like a yo-yo for the first 6 years. He stayed and never left after that, but the damage was done. So - I had to tackle it. 

I researched about effective communication and planned how I would talk to my Dad about how he hurt me and to figure out if I could understand why and let the pain go. 

I wrote a short script and then asked my Dad if we could talk. It was something like, “Dad, I know this is a difficult subject, but I’d like it if we can just clear the air. I want to understand why you left me so many times as a young child so we both can move forward.”

I didn’t get my answer, because he didn’t have one himself - he didn’t understand his own reasons. I decided that if I wanted to continue a positive relationship with my Dad, I had to learn to accept this. 

So I researched acceptance. I then wrote in my log every time I struggled to accept something, and thought about ways I could come to terms with things. I learned acceptance is not the same as forgiveness. Acceptance means “it happened, I feel this way, I can’t change it; but I can move forward from it.” 

Acceptance has nothing to do with forgiving the other person - it does have everything to do with holding them accountable. 

After this, I decided the only way to get over my Fear of Abandonment was to physically stop myself. Whenever I felt that horrid, bubbling feeling - I sat on my hands. I bit my tongue. I forced myself to *let people leave*. It was so fucking hard. But I had made a promise to myself that I wanted to get better. So when they left, I turned my phone off. I turned my attention to punching my pillows, singing my heart out, cleaning up. Anything that prevented me from 1. hurting myself. 2. manipulating or guilt tripping another person. 

Eventually, my fear began to fade away. It’s been two years since my last episode. I have finally gotten to the point that if someone threatens to leave me in a petty argument, I simply wave and say “goodbye, then.” If they’re serious, I will offer ways to resolve the issue - if that doesn’t work, I don’t beg. I just say “ok” and leave it at that. 

Because I had researched communication, I began logging about my interactions with others. I wanted to see how much I could remember about the conversations I was having with people and what I could remember about the people I was having them with. Such as: What was their kids name? Their partners name? What is their profession? Did they mention anything interesting you want to know more about? 

Combining the research on communication and making myself remember things about another person made the next time we conversed immensely easier and more comfortable. 

This also improved my existing relationships tenfold and I began researching about healthy relationships. I noticed that some of my relationships were toxic and draining, but I had glossed over them. I used my communication research and tried to fix the relationships that were a little battered, but most of them faded away naturally as I got stronger. 

Because I knew how to tolerate/beat my fear of abandonment, I was totally OK with what would have usually felt like a massive loss. I didn’t feel like I lost anything at all. 

My self-esteem began to rise. I began to feel more confident and independent. 

Eventually, all my other symptoms slowly started to fade. 

Now, I did go to DBT in November 2018 and the techniques I learned in there really just propelled me to the end of my recovery. There’s also an amazing book “The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Work Book” that helps me stay on top of things. 

I was told in June 2019 that I no longer meet the criteria. Despite that, I am rejoining that DBT group in the New Year. 

It’s possible to recover. Marsha Linehan did. She says if she can do it, anyone can and I believe her. 

I know BPD feels like a Hell hole but no matter how cliché this is, it can get better. 

It was by no means easy and it took me 5 years and hundreds (no exaggeration) of relapses. This is only a snippet of my journey, but I hope it’s a snippet that inspires/helps you on your own journey. 

Love."
IMPORTANT REMINDER: Just because you didn’t intend to be emotionally abusive doesn’t mean you weren’t emotionally abusive.,1177,giltnk,132,"*Please read until the end as I believe this is something a lot of us need to hear*

——

So I have recently gotten back together with my partner. During our time apart, I began DBT therapy. Now, of course I am happy to start rebuilding my relationship with him, but one key necessity in doing so is being honest with myself about my past actions. And I think the hardest pill to swallow is that I was, in fact, emotionally abusive.

I see a lot of posts on here detailing their poor treatment of their partner, and though some posts I’ve seen include undertones of remorse, many other posts exist simply to fuel the normalization of this abuse. Yes, abuse. It’s time that we as a community start recognizing it for what it is. 

Using tears as a means to influence your partner’s behavior is not a symptom of this disorder, it’s abuse. Screaming at your partner because they cancelled plans with you is not a symptom of this disorder, it’s abuse. Threatening to break up with your partner if they don’t drop everything and come home to you isn’t a symptom of this disorder, it’s abuse.

I understand that you may think to yourself “WelI I didn’t intend to hurt them. I just let my emotions get the better of me”. The problem with this mindset is that it perpetuates the idea that intentions hold precedence over actions, causing you to relinquish responsibility for the pain you’ve caused, and thus continuing the cycle of abuse.

Victims of emotional abuse do not care about your intentions and they shouldn’t be expected to. Think about it in this way- if you were crossing the street and someone hits you with their car because they weren’t paying attention to the road, are you just gonna say “It’s okay, you didn’t mean to.” Probably not.

On one final note, I just wanna say I know this disorder is rough. It really is. We have to put so much more effort into managing our emotions than everyone else. It isn’t fair, but it IS reality. And rejecting that reality by allowing ourselves to hurt the ones we love will only make it worse. Your emotions are your responsibility. Accept that and grow from it."
A list of things I wish romantic partners would understand about my experience with BPD.,1179,b4n8rt,114,"• When I sound fully competent and self-aware as I explain that I have Borderline Personality Disorder, it doesn’t mean I do not have BPD. I am not always in the middle of an episode. 

• When I explain how bad I can get during an episode, I am not looking for sympathy and reassurance. I am not putting myself down so that you will validate me. I am trying to be honest about what is to come so that we can both be prepared.

• We should probably set important boundaries before we start any sort of relationship. I will not have trouble respecting boundaries if our relationship was built on them. It is harder for me to respect boundaries established later in a relationship. For that, I am sorry. 

• If I go fully silent in the middle of an episode, it is not because I am giving you the silent treatment. I am dissociating and trying to prevent myself from escalating the situation and doing and saying something I will regret. Please give me some time to let my emotions return to normal and recognize I am not trying to punish you. 

• If I discuss suicide, I am not doing it to make you feel guilty. To me, suicidal thoughts are such a significant part of my daily thought process that I genuinely forget that most people are alarmed by casual suicidal discussion. If you let me know you are uncomfortable, I will work hard to stop mentioning it around you. I do not want to make you feel responsible for my thoughts. And I will always remind you that it is not your fault. 

• My enthusiasm and passion are not fake just because a few people on the internet say that it is. If we bond over something, and I am excited, my happiness is genuine. We are sharing a real connection.

• I am not just mirroring everything you do. I have my own interests and hobbies that do not change. Just because /some/ of my identity is in flux doesn’t mean /all/ of it is. If I become interested in something you like, that is because it is a normal part of forming bonds with others.

• If I am having a breakdown that has nothing to do with you, the best thing to do is to distract me from the negative emotions. I just might not be able to ask for that in the moment because I am not thinking clearly, which is why I need to change the emotions before doing anything else.

• Please do not make empty promises. If you don’t think you are capable of something, do not tell me that you are. I understand wanting to make me happy in that moment, but I am absolutely crushed by empty promises, cancelled plans, etc. I have to work hard to manage my expectations. Please do not promise me the world when you know you can’t give it to me. 

• If you want to end the relationship, please do so. Do not lie to me about how you’re feeling and stay with me just because you don’t want to hurt me. Do not cheat on me because you’re afraid of dumping me. That betrayal makes it worse. I know it will be hard, but if I am begging you not to break up with me, block me. Refuse to engage. It will hurt me so much that I will try to do anything to stop the pain, but I ultimately recognize that it is bad for both of us if I do that. And it is easier for me to say that now than in the middle of an episode.

• My love for you is real. I will not destroy your life. I have empathy for you. I care about you. My brain is a little bit broken, and I have to fight it. Sometimes, it’s too broken, and it’s too hard for you. I understand if you need to leave. Just don’t listen to people who tell you I do not have the capacity to love, care, and empathize. I do. "
I want people to understand what BPD is actually like,1136,ev5upy,67,"I get having a favourite person, disassociation, abandonment issues, no sense of identity,etc... But in some ways, it’s so much more than just the nine or so symptoms in the DSM. That’s almost too simple. Someone just reading the DSM could never understanding exactly how far reaching and invasive this disorder actually is. 

I think my friends think I’m a bit lost and emotionally a bit manic. They think I’m a little highly strung, or simply hyper.  They think my existence is like the stereotypical manic pixie dream girl, a little troubled, but interesting. The extent of the mess is hidden, and I don’t know if I want them to know more. 

They don’t know about so many things.

How I had a meltdown the other night because I couldn’t braid my hair right at 12.30AM in the morning, cried and wanted to throw things like a child. 

The way I get so pent up on one emotion and too obsessed, overthinking to the point where I bite myself or grab the nearest sharp object to simply release some of this energy.

The paranoia. How actually, genuinely crazy I am. Thinking everyone hates me, is talking about me and then the extreme, like thinking cameras are in my room.

How suspicious I am of them, and how my opinion of them constantly changes. 

How I can love them so much one minute, then resent their existence the next.

How everything takes so much effort. How even focussing on one task takes so much energy, because my head never shuts the fuck up. 

To what extent I can’t enjoy basic socialising, because I disassociate, and have to go to the toilet to ground myself. 

How shaky my identity is. To the point that changing my clothes makes me feel like a different person. How can you know me, if I don’t?

How nowhere feels like home. Nowhere can be yours, if you are no one.

How I want to rage and scream and cry, and then laugh and shout with joy. And how quickly I flick.

How every piece of affirmation and compliment defines my short term personality and makes my day.

But also how every slight, perceived rejection makes me spiral and hate myself. 

How hard everyday activities are, because if they don’t go right, again I switch and spiral. 

I feel so much joy, but also so much sadness. So much of my energy is used just keeping the base of my life intact, but add any strains, and it cracks. Then all of a sudden I’m crying in my kitchen, accusing my best friend of hating me.

Sometimes I want to die, because I cannot cope. Sometimes I love life, because it’s amazing. But most of the time, I’m just exhausted from all of this.

I know it can get better, and I’m seeing a therapist and doing DBT. I eat well and exercise and put all my energy into keeping the axes of my life stable.  All of that leaves me drained, and then I fall into bed. 

And I cannot fucking sleep.

Edit: I posted this as a rant I wrote during a lecture and never expected so many comments. I will try and reply to all of them tomorrow, but I appreciate all of them. Thank you"
Worst part of BPD is never knowing if your feelings are valid or an overreaction,1109,ahi7pb,80,"I never know if I can rightfully be upset at someone or if I am letting them walk all over me because I automatically assume my emotions are getting the best of me.

 I feel like I have no gauge of reality and it sucks when it comes to relationships "
"Yesterday, instead of drinking I went to the gym. After the gym I came home and made dinner and read. I didn't drink and I didn't feel bad about myself. Woke up this morning still feeling alright. A success I wanted to share. Thank you.",1101,9qnzal,77,
Anyone else incredibly embarrassed by their own behaviour following an episode?,1069,l2ocd1,136,"In the moment I feel like I couldn’t give a shit about what anyone thinks of me or the way I’m acting, because at the time my emotions feel so real and justified.

When I calm down and go back to rational, normal me, I am soul crushingly embarrassed and ashamed of what I’ve said and done. To the point where I can’t actually believe that was me. God what must people think of us? I cannot bare the thought of what people think, especially people that obviously I would never want to know about my condition like my boyfriends family, who hear about my behaviour and must just think I’m a massive bitch. It makes me want the ground to swallow me up and never be seen again.

EDIT: the response to this post has been amazing. I would just like to say I am proud of every single one of us for battling through this illness day in day out. The fact that we all feel so much shame about our behaviour just illuminates how deeply we truly do feel and care as human beings. We may be a lil broken but I whole heartedly believe we are all incredibly strong and so full of love. Let’s all direct some of this love to ourselves today."
Just got released from the psych ward and turned on my phone to all of 0 messages,1050,jszoo8,180,"Hurts just a lot that no one noticed that I was missing for a week. I’m trying not to let this confirm my suspicion that no one would care if I was gone.

Edit: Thank you all so much for you kind replies and messages. You have no idea how much they all mean to me right now. I love you all <3. Also, I just bought myself a Squishmallow to keep me company in these next few days (at the very least, stuffed animals can never leave me). "

We need to stop normalizing having an FP.,1035,e7zw34,341,"Sometimes mental health communities can have a tendency to validate and normalize behaviors, and I've noticed the term Favorite Person is one of them.

The real meaning is Codependent Relationship.

Fixating on another person and using them for validation, an anchor, and emotional regulation isn't healthy. Of course some support in a close relationship is normal, but there's a point where someone desires constant contact and support, and it becomes toxic.

If you constantly rely on a person to feel better, you're not learning the skills it takes to improve. You're going to overwhelm them sometimes or tire them out, because no one can meet all of your needs all the time. When they're not there to help you feel better, you're going to feel abandoned, helpless, and alone.

This was a really important realization for me. It's not a ""normal"" part of borderline. It's negative and harmful behavior for both parties. We're predisposed.

Of course, I'm not saying to just up and dump your FP.

 Just maybe acknowledge that it would be healthier if you focused on meeting your own emotional needs more. Setting boundaries, using more coping skills or calming activities. Shutting off your phone for a couple hours, or taking a long bath.

Maybe this doesn't ring true for everyone, and it's hard to accept. But I just thought this is an important subject and I'd like to discuss it."
I FINALLY DID IT! IT IS POSSIBLE!,1024,hiosp4,78,"I’ve been homeless for 3 years. I finally was able to get a low-income apartment. It sucks but I try to not be ungrateful for what I have; even if it means living with mold and bugs. 


It’s been four full years since living in my car, or a tent, with no water or electricity, low income apartment riddled with bugs or mold...


BUT I GOT A HOUSE!!! I sign a lease in three hours and I can’t believe after all these years, it’s really happening. 

Thanks for reading, Reddit family. 😊

edit:
mold and bugs were from before (bad situations + homelessness). Now we are in a clean home :) you guys are awesome!"
Does anyone else have full awareness in what they are doing in the moment (like during an episode) but have no way of stopping yourself in the moment then feel intense guilt / shame after?,1014,i19axg,108,"Let's talk about this: we are actually highly aware of ourselves, our actions, and how others feel. When triggered, I realized I do this thing where I know my thoughts are irrational and that I shouldn't react so intensely but my emotions are so strong I cannot control how I react to them. This is intensifies and I grow more angry, if I either get the wrong response or feel misunderstood then I feel the need to continue to explain/defend my point? It really sucks because after I cool down, I often feel intense shame/guilt. I think all of that shame is still building up in me and I haven't forgiven myself for things I've done and said in the past but it still affects me greatly. I just hate that I always get that ""you're going too far"" feeling but the feeling of ""prove yourself"" takes over at times."
The most annoying part of having BPD is watching yourself ruin your own life,973,cwytkx,75,"And you can’t do anything about it. It’s like, you’re aware that you’re ruining everything and wreaking havoc but you’re not in control as if the “other you” is taking control. 

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you take control of such situations?"
"So, I hoping I'm not alone but does anyone else live a secret imaginary life?",971,iat64n,166,"You don't have say anything about it, maybe upvote if you do. It's your choice."
People misinterpret the reason borderlines self harm,963,md3wy7,181,"Im currently studying psychology, and we had our basic unit on mental illness, and something that I found to be untrue is that we were taught that people with bpd will self harm after arguements, fights, or upsetting events to garner sympathy from others and to manipulate our loved ones into feeling sorry for us. Im not too sure if this apply’s to everyone, but if I get into a fight and I hurt someone, I dont self harm to make the other person feel bad and to turn myself into the victim; I do it to punish myself for saying something I didnt mean and I feel the need to put the pain that I caused someone back on to myself. I wish people would understand that not everything a person with bpd does is some big evil scheme to manipulate others."
Med Student here: I'm so sick and tired of the way BPD is taught and portrayed in the field,958,l7x0z0,110,"I'm still in my personality disorder class, but it's so annoying and frustrating how every review book, lecturerer and review resource calls bpd individuals ""difficult"", ""should avoid"", ""attention seeking"". 
My professor's example of bpd individuals is people who keeps showing up to the ER with cuts and takes up beds when the ER has people with other physical medical issues to actually deal with. 
His idea of how our splitting is a defense mechanism is that we don't have to take responsibility for our actions by putting people into boxes rather than even mentioning the fear of abandonment or the emotional burn victims or any of the other more accurate ways I've heard of BPD. 
I remember when I started working in psychiatry during my gap year, the nurses would be like, yeah stay away from patients with bpd because they're the worst out of all of the hospital. And i'm like... no. 
They aren't. 
We just want someone to actually care. 
It takes so much to go and seek help that knowing this is what's taught throughout the field is so so dissappointing."
I was supposed to die today.,949,emyry4,114,"edit: thanks everybody so much for all the kind words i literally dont know what to say :(. just. thanks a lot

My suicide date was January 10, 2020. I had this set in stone for months. I was so sure that I was going to do it for MONTHS.

But I didn’t.

I won’t.

I’m here. Right now. And I’ll be okay, right now. 

My friends came over to keep me company because it’s still pretty tender, idk if I could be alone, but…at least I’m here. That’s a start."
Hurting people is not a symptom of BPD.,923,gaoaxf,132,"I’m a little concerned about some of the posts I’m reading on here. I understand that we are a group of hurt individuals but I feel a sense of responsibility to hold myself to a standard after the diagnosis. I try not to use it as an excuse for my behavior. 


There are things about this disorder that no one will understand. No one. But, as we all know, we are not the same as the other Cluster B disorders. We feel guilt and are able to analyze ourselves critically (albeit we have a tendency to go too far with it). Reading that “leading people on for fun and then hating them” is a symptom of the disorder and seeing so many upvotes on it is so disheartening. I live most of my life shying away from explaining the mental constraints that abandonment and abuse have left me with because people lump us in with psychopaths and narcissists. 


We’re not. We are accountable for what we have done. And more importantly, we are accountable for what we do today. I don’t mean that in a negative way; see it positively. Don’t go too heavy on the guilt and self hatred; just accept that you struggle with something and do your best today. Hurting people is NOT a symptom of BPD. It does NOT give you the entitlement to expect people to put up with nonsense. It IS an unfair hurdle that we have to overcome but life is unfair. 


I’m not sitting on a high horse here- I make mistakes all of the time; I’ve made some today. I might tomorrow. But I am NEVER going to say that hurting someone or doing something wrong is because of my mental challenges. My mistakes are my cross to bear. Please don’t tell yourself that these are “symptoms”. The pain we feel and the tendencies to overcome that pain are symptoms. Involving other people with pain is NOT. 



I don’t want to come across as insensitive at all; I understand the nagging guilt and shame. I understand the emptiness. I understand the suffering. I struggle daily not to let my pain leak out onto those around me (mostly the urge to end my life or tell my friends all about how much I want to end my life) because it can be so overwhelming at times and I am not perfect. And I understand, trust me, that when you lash out you are only trying to protect yourself and the pain you feel from the event is ten times worse than anyone you lashed out against. 



I, and we, are only human. We make mistakes. The first step is to acknowledge that we are responsible for any pain we cause. 



So please do not say that hurting people is a symptom of BPD. It simply is not.



Lovingly,

From one hurting person to another."
Can we normalize ignoring people until you’re in a good mindset to reply?,926,kn1nez,149,Feeling way too anxious and pressured to reply online even thought I don't think I should. Everyone should take commuication at their own pace imho
My wife has BPD &,914,cokxa8,103,"she is the most selfless, intelligent, witty, compassionate human I know. She feels SO deeply whether it be in a negative or positive way and it makes her such a strong/understanding person. We’ve been together for almost 9 years and have gone through hell and back, but even in the darkest of times I’ve promised her to always be her light. Since she was diagnosed 2 years ago (which she totally diagnosed herself way before her therapist lol) we’ve learned that communication is the number 1 key to our relationship and to helping us understand BPD. I know this post is all over the place but I just want people to know that you can be in a healthy, understanding, loving long term relationship/marriage and live with BPD. You deserve love no matter what your demons or shitty humans tell you ♥️"
Was anyone else not really raised by their parents?,906,kj2bwk,132,"I grew up in their house and they fed me. I was given a bed time and was taken to school when I needed to be. But was anyone else not truly raised by their parents? 


Not taught how to cope, how to **be** with others, how to live? I had a lot of void where *something* should have been. I was partially raised by the internet, groomed by men online, always struggling with compassion to myself and others. 


I'm not here to blame them, but also, why have kids if not to share the ways of a good life with them? To extend what you know and teach them what you wish you would've known. Now I'm 21, on the path to really figuring it out before I destroy myself, and on a mission to raise the child my parents never did."
"Is anyone else a highly self-aware/reflective person with BPD and you feel like your counselor, psychiatrists, or some friends don’t understand how like crazy you can be because they only see the self aware side??",903,af17c7,108,"No like seriously. I feel like only my boyfriend and family know Bc they’re the only people that see my episodes and outbursts. 

I try to keep all of my friends at a distance but like ok so I talk to them and my counselor and I feel like they just validate me (which is like good) BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY JUST DEFEND WHY I DO FUCKED UP THINGS WITHOUT REALIZING HOW FUCKED UP THE THINGS R THAT I DO!!

LIKE IM SERIOUSLY 23 YEARS OLD AND I YELL AND SCREAM AT PEOPLE BC I FEEL LIKE THEY DONT UNDERSTAND ME AND ILL GO ON FOR HOURS

like I feel like I can’t get help if people don’t really know who I am
But it’s not like I’m gonna show up to my counselor and have an episode 
Like I’m really good at concealing that side of me around other people
But mostly Bc I distance myself and try not to open up
Does anyone else feel this???"
"advice from borderline to borderline: people in your life are not obsessing, remembering, or holding grudges against your small mistakes as much as you are. You are doing that to yourself.",902,mha8kz,51,"The biggest moment of growth in my life as a borderline was accepting the fact that neurodivergence/atypicality means I can't fairly apply my own sensitive, obsessive thinking to how others perceive me. I worry about extraordinary circumstances because I am not normal, but most people think completely differently.

Example, when I flub up a word in a conversation, or forget to say sorry 3 times, nobody is going to be thinking about that in an hour. They will be thinking about writing, baseball, food, their car. This is the way most people live their life without splitting or obsession. I had to be taught that. I do not have to punish myself by thinking everybody hates me when my actions are insignificant to them in comparison to how I evaluate myself.

I hope this gives some peace as much as it does for me."
Would anybody be interested in a DBT skill of the day kinda post?,898,fzf1fn,86,"We could have a post a day where we highlight a DBT skill that works and in what context you used it?

Anybody want that or am i just chatting out my arse?

EDIT: This has blown up a bit. I’ll start doing it. It might not be everyday because I have to work and look after my own well being but I will try my absolute best to do this everyday.

things no one tells you about bpd.,875,loa93z,51,"the multiples of panic attacks you get when it feels like someone is abandoning you and you feel like you’re going to die in the exact moment. feeling like everyday is the same and the agony of having the idea in your mind that nothing is real due to dissociation. when you’re bored and it’s not like you’re just bored, it’s like there is something crushing your mind and sometimes you even get headaches because it’s literally void, void, void, void. trying so hard to be a good person but still feeling like a monster. fighting for what is left of your unstable limited relationships family, friend or pet you still have left. without being perceived to much of a handful and toxic human being. may you all find balance one day fellow bpd brothers and sisters. peace be with you all."
Does anyone else with BPD constantly feel the need to delete all their socials/get them back/delete?,864,ldcr6i,154,"My councillor told me he didn’t understand this and none of my friends do either and can’t understand why I won’t just leave it alone, but I’m literally constantly deleting my instagram, whatsapp etc. I think it’s kind of due to a mixture of feeling like no one wants me around anyway, disassociating, and not knowing how to present myself. Literally any time I start to slip even slightly into the pit my immediate thought it to delete myself off the face of the earth so that no one can contact me at all, and this is a problem on instagram because it only lets you do it once a week. But like if I’m not able to remove my online presence I then feel the need to do something even more self destructive i.e. self harm. Anyone else or just me lmao"
Can i get a like for every person we’ve lost due to splitting!??,854,aczvgu,48,Lol i lost so many people from splitting . And very important relationships at that. 
Someone put this on Facebook and I felt others should see it.,857,fgh8zj,69,"Borderline Personality Disorder isn’t being cute and ‘clingy’ and ‘adorably needy’. Being with (romantic or otherwise) someone with BPD isn’t akin to taking care of a pet. BPD isn’t an ‘aw it’s so endearing that they need me so badly’ type of thing. 

BPD is a mental illness that is a conglomeration of several different tendencies and it’s not easy to diagnose. You don’t just decide you have it, just like you don’t decide you’re depressed because you had a bad  day, or you don’t decide you’re bipolar because your mood changes quickly sometimes. Believe  me, you don’t want it.

BPD is turning nothing into everything, is knowing you’re being irrational and not being able to stop regardless, is suppressing breakdowns for fear of being abusive or of manipulating the person you’re talking to into having to take care of you when they really don’t want to.

It’s thinking someone doesn’t care about you anymore because they made a new friend. It’s automatically registering new people as a threat. It’s a fear of abandonment and rejection that’s damn near omnipresent. It’s being able to shift from ‘I love you so much!’ to ‘I don’t give a fuck, I hate you, I don’t even want to talk to you’ and back at the drop of a hat.

It’s finding identity in a drastic hair change, and then feeling unsafe and desperately trying to fix it before you have to go out. It’s seeing someone you adore and trying to emulate them because you have no idea who you are. It’s waking up and trying to be a new person every day. Go vegan, go goth, go hipster, go glamour, cut your hair, change your makeup, gain weight, lose weight, and never feel quite there. Ever.

It’s comprehending ‘love’ as ‘pity’ and wanting to rip yourself apart if their tone is all too casual when your friend or love interest is returning compliments or affection. It’s regretting saying anything about your mood and desperately trying to turn the conversation around while simultaneously NEEDING to get it out. It’s wanting to bleed yourself dry as opposed to cry in someone’s arms because, at least then, they don’t have to clean your wounds for you. They won’t hate you. They won’t be annoyed. 

It’s the constant battle, every time you get upset, of, “Is this worth being sad about? Is it worth talking about? What is more abusive, talking about this or hiding it? If I tell them I’ll bring them down and I’ll guilt trip them and they will resent me and it will all be my fault. If I don’t, I’m a disgusting liar, I’m manipulative, I’m untrustworthy.”

It’s wondering if you’re faking your symptoms. It’s disassociating and feeling like a ghost for days. It’s feeling like you aren’t real, and then wishing you weren’t. It’s fear, a lack of self, and about a million different thoughts running through your head at all times. It’s trying to live for the people you love as opposed to yourself. It’s feeling suicidal and then feeling bad for feeling suicidal because, whoops, you’re being manipulative."
"Borderline - the ""I don't know disorder"".",853,gw1u2t,47,"I feel like ""I don't know"" is my only honest answer I could give about myself.

I used to believe, there is some combination of words, phrases, beautiful quotes that will change me. That some letters near to each other, read by voice in my head are going to make me light a bulb and make me a different person. Because I have a lot of questions about myself, but non of books, therapy, friends, psychologist, reddit-quora-twitter-google searches gave me any clue about: How to change every “why?” in my life?

Why am I sad? Why am I happy? Why am I angry? Why am I numb? What makes me feel all of the emotions and experience their constant swinging? Because they keep changing, even if I am looking at bland wall. Why I can't be stable and constant with my behavior, views and values? Why people are accusing me of lying and manipulating, even if I always say stuff, that I feel is real in this particular moment? Is this why I feel everyone gets sick of me? Or am I offending them, by wanting them to stay? Because I am definitely saying something stupid, bad and offensive, so they are gonna abandon me, when they  have a chance.  
 

Why am I constantly and obsessively doing everything for some people even if I don't really care about them five minutes later? Why am I getting so easily attached to people around me? Why I can't let go? And the worst: when they let go and get rid of me - why am I mad? Do I have obsession about control? Or do I clearly don't understand myself?  
 

Why she was so perfect from the get-go? Why she move on with her live so easily? I told her to leave me alone and I closed the doors, but why she didn’t come back through the tiny crack in a window? She prolly hated me, so why am I missing her? I thought I wanted control, but why is it not making me satisfy? I get rid of her. It was my decision. It was my fully aware, self-conscious decision based on fictional and non-existing assumptions created in my head…     
 

Why am I seeing all my mistakes right know? Why am I so sure, that if I got second chance, I would make exactly the same mistakes again? Because she was “the next time”. Or, to be precise, the “next, next, next, next time”. The “this time everything will be different” time. But nothing really matters – I am constantly, incessantly  same unstable, inconstant person. Why can’t I change even if I looking for it?  
 

Why I feel like a puppy, who is constantly trying to chase his owner, but he didn’t notice and can’t understand, that his owner left him in a deep forest? The owner is gone and left me empty. He’s gestures, mannerism, opinions were also mine. How am I gonna live without someone holding my leash? What will be my favorite number? Color? Movie? Book? Country to live in? My life is an empty picture, to which I need someone to put the colors of another human.  
 

Of course they can’t hold me to tight, to close to them, because I will bite – that’s my nature. But I am running between dark forest and bright, sunny street looking for something. In a forest I am sad and overwhelmed.  On the street - I am fighter, I am changing the way I look, I stay straight, confident – because I have a purpose – I am looking for something, that I never really have. And I feel so many things, as long as I’m not gonna fall into the river. Because in flowing water I am hopeless. I cry, I need help. I can’t pull up myself from this slump. And then I fall asleep and I wake up in the forest. And worst thing is – street, forest and river are few minutes apart. And I am going between them every day.

Why I constantly feel emptiness inside? Is it possible, that I tried everything to get rid of that feeling, and  it's still within me? Why every person, who felt exactly the same emptiness that I, committed (or try to) suicide? Why I lost myself between verses of Sylvia Plath poems? Why nothing makes this emptiness disappear? Money, things, entertainment, work, college, friends, relationships, drugs, religion, passion, games, books, sex, self-harm, homelessness, meditation, sport... I touched all of this in some moment of my life, but why none of this change my behavior? What really matters for me? Is there a place, where I have never seeked? Do I even care enough to keep looking? Why I keep giving up on dreams in a heat of a moment? And why they seem so blurry and unreal, when my moods change? Do I even have dreams or just random empowerment thanks to random wave of thoughts? What are my desires? 

Why empty paper is best description of my personality? Who I really am? Why I let people scratch and destroyed me, but I allow my anger to come out on people who tried to help me? Why I am so afraid of attachment? Of losing myself in reality?   
 

Why I switch between empowerment and hopelessness on daily basis? Which version on me is real? One where I self-sabotage my daily life with every stupid decision human being can make in short period of time or one where I am obsessively fighting for things I don't really care? Or one where I am numb on things and life is just passing by? 

Why I have trouble with answering every question about myself? I am getting so angry, when I hear any question about me. What do you want in future? I don’t know. What is the job you want? Are you hungry? Do you like this place? What do you think about this color? What are you interests? What do you do for fun? What is your favorite movie/book/game? Do you believe in God? In life after death? How do I looked in that shirt? Is everyone looking at you? Why are you screaming? Why haven’t you called back?  
Why I’ve got absolutely no answers  or I’ve answers, but dishonest, based on what person am I talking to?  
 

I can’t make journal, mood calendars or personality test – because every answer would be a lie. I don’t know single thing about me. Am I introvert or extravert? Is being disappointed with people and wanting to be alone, makes me introvert? But when I am alone, I'm gonna feel unbearably empty. At the same time, is wanting to be with people, because without nobody around, I am not gonna stand up from bed, makes me extravert? But I either gonna fight them or adopt to their personality, because mine is non-existing. Which one is worth suffering? Emptiness or life of lies? I don’t know. I don’t know even if I am hungry or not. Sometimes I am not even sure who is the person in mirror looking at me.

Why am I lying to myself? Why I am breaking my promises to myself - even if I know I would feel better, if i keep them? Why I am 100% aware of my bad behavior, but just I can’t stop? Why am I coming back to self harming and self loathing even if I know, that later it’s going to leave me with disappointment? 

Why I feel so dissociated from my own behavior, that I even forget things I do? Did I really talk with this person yesterday or was it just a dream? Did I screamed at somebody? That's impossible, we were definitely laughing… at least at the beginning.   
 

Why my mind and my body are so far away from each other? Why, can I keep punching wall and breaking my fingers and hurting myself, but at the same time my mind is reciting Meditation of Marcus Aurelius in my mind. Because stoicism is the way of life, isn’t it? Or was is Daoism? Definitely Buddhism! Or Jesus is waiting for us and our good deeds? No, no. There is nothing there, we are mistake and only got this life. Full nihilism. Or is it existentialism?  Or maybe just live in a moment? Take everything step by step, day by day? It was slow life! Or was is minimalism? But what if I want more things? Capitalism? Socialism? New World Order? Is it really matter? This virus is gonna kill us all. Or it’s a hoax and people are just panicking to much.   


I wish I understand my own thoughts.

Do I spend too much time in my head? Is it rumination? Or did I just bottled up so many emotions, that they need to pop up in any possible way? But why I keep daydreaming? Is it maladaptive daydreaming? Is it bad, that I have a place, where life is not so disappointing? Where I am not lying myself? Where people always coming back? Where I can handle life? Where I don't have to say sorry? Where I can keep myself as a whole? Where I don’t have to be worried about whose looking at me or what I am wearing, thinking, doing, watching or about mistake in making taxes, because I can create dragon, who’s gonna eat whole government?  Why can’t I let go of this fictional world, that I am closed in? Am I afraid I’m gonna lose only thing I’ve created in my life?

Why am I doing so many things impulsively? Why trying to wait with decision, makes me feel anxious? And why every anxiety attack needs to be so strong? Why every stress is so overwhelming? Why every minor thing is gonna stick with me and be in my brain, so it's gonna pop up to unbearably size in worst possible moment? Why small things are so big for me, that big moments seems like they mean absolutely nothing? Crying over tripping on street and somebody death – there is no difference. It’s always 100%. Something is always the worst/the best thing that ever happened in my entire life. The most romantic, sensual love. The worst, disgusting hate. I am never gonna eat anything in my life. Or ever stop eating. Because this is the most incredible, beautiful experience I could ever imagine. Or it’s so awful, monstrous, fake, evil, nightmarish, catastrophic, terrible, bad, tragic, fatal thing that any human being ever experienced.  
 

Why the bad things always comes easier and stay longer? Is it because every time when I feel great, I feel like superman heading into the sun, but every time I got close to it, I feel down to earth? Deeper and harder? The happier I am, the sadder I will be. I just know that switch gonna happen. And I can’t prevent it. But why I have to hurt people around me with my irrational thinking?

Is borderline behavior always gonna be part of me? Or will it always be my excuse for broken friendships and wasted opportunities? For all the times I couldn’t make myself cry, even if situation needed this; and all the times I blew up with anger, even if nothing really happened and everything was peaceful? Am I borderline? Or is borderline with me? Is it destroying my life or is it my creation? The creation of every choice and mistake I’ve make.  
 

Because isn’t borderline just build on a parts of every other disorder and feeling? Excitement, depression, pain, unconsciousness, neurosis, ACoA, ADHD, paranoia, innocence, disappointment, regret, frustration, depersonalization, perfectionism, skepticism, nihilism, existentialism, lies and nothingness – elements of all of this can be find In BPD.

All of this question have their own answer. But it doesn't matter. Every answer provides a new question. Every question needs an answers. But there always be next question, next answer. And always there will be a doubt: “Is it really what I want and feel?”. Because my own views and values are moving as the clock pendulum swings. Because there is no pattern. Where the pendulum stopped – this version of me gonna show up. And I’m gonna believe in this version of me. Because it's gonna be me. But at the same time – it’s not me.   
 

My black and white thinking seem more like my brain is running between dark, black room and bright, white room – so no matter “where” I am – I’m uncomfortable and I’m suffering from my previous choices. And even if I sit down between them, they are still effecting me.   
 

Is there any combination of words that will change me? Am I the one whose capable of creating those words? I don’t know, but I stopped believing in this."
"I hear people say, ‘It’s okay to take a mental health day.’ But, I feel like most of my days are ‘taking mental health days’.",839,iqae65,35,"Maybe my BPD is just overwhelming me. I don’t know. I feel so conflicted and like a terrible partner because my spouse has to help me so much. I’m so thankful I have a spouse who tries to help so much, but, I feel like my problems are becoming his problems.. and inherently everyone around me’s problem. 

I’m just exhausted. I hope this changes."
People love to gaslight you once they learn you have BPD,833,g70ov2,124,"Suddenly everything you do is a symptom. Disagree with their opinion? It's all manufactured by your disorder. Feel hurt by something they did? You're just being overly sensitive. 

It's really frustrating, as I try not to make my disorder my identity, yet other people do it for me."
I’m so tired of people using my BPD against me to gaslight me,827,fcrfpo,88,"Sometimes you’re right. Sometimes they DID wrong you. Sometimes they need to apologize. Sometimes you have a genuine reason to be upset. Having BPD does not mean that every reason you’re hurt is invalid, or that every reaction you give is exaggerated or crazy. I’m so tired of “Oh my god you’re crazy; this is not you talking it’s the borderline”. No. It’s me talking. Stop using my BPD to validate yourself and make yourself feel better about hurting me."
"YES two borderlines can love and commit to each other fully and honestly and achieve remission together! My husband [42m] and I [34f] just celebrated 8 years of marriage. Our therapist said this week ""you both have achieved the impossible"".",828,jgpasu,70,"I am not the type to give up, and I am not the type to give up. Once I knew I had BPD, I wanted to be a success story. When I found out my husband has BPD as well, I wanted to help him overcome it as well. I wanted to be that couple that defied the odds. I want to help others find this level of peace and connection. I want to help ""normal"" couples learn how to communicate effectively and live consciously. I think so many people without BPD have the same issues of miscommunication, assumptions, casual abuse, poor reactions, but on a lesser scale and without the intensity of emotional eruptions.

The truth is: all couples trigger each other. However, when two borderlines are living subconsciously (behavior is autopilot, not deliberate or examined) and they trigger each other, the reactions cause more triggers and can spiral out of control into defensiveness, abuse, and reactive abuse. We lived in this way for several years of our relationship and were considered ""insecurely attached."" We stuck it out and over the years, and with time and therapy (separately and together), we became securely attached.

We decided together to live consciously in this couple, and become aware when we are triggered, communicate effectively, respect each others' highly unique differences, and grow together. We are ALWAYS deliberate. We will not make a mistake and ask for forgiveness, we act consciously and deliberately all of the time. We make sure that time together is quality time and that we get enough time on our own to nurture our other relationships and the relationship we have with ourselves so we have the energy to be deliberate when we are together. We help each other when we are unaware that we are triggered. Half of the time, he knows I am triggered before I do, and I know he is triggered before he does. He knows when to let me come to the realization on my own, and I know how to help make him aware so he can decide what he needs.

We both grew up suppressed, invalidated, and extremely neglected. I was actively abused not just by both of my parents but by other adults. Because of the suppression, we both have been working on being as authentic as possible. When you are suppressed as a child, as an adult we have a hard time speaking up. Since I was abused as a child, my body reacts strongly to being approached, even for a hug. I go into paralysis/fight or flight, just from my husband approaching me in the kitchen with a hug. I had a hard time speaking up during these moments. This caused a lot of disconnection for us. Once I made the choice to be as authentic as possible and bring this up in couples' therapy, we came up with a new plan. Instead of him approaching me, I will approach him. This dramatically changed our dynamic and gave us both a HUGE dose of safety and security in the relationship. He is happy for me to approach him anytime, but I still ask for consent since I know he has a hard time speaking up as well. This is just a small example of being authentic. Once we became authentic (letting go of fear, obligation, and guilt) and made the choice to make safety and security our daily goal, we find it extremely easy to connect. In fact, this relationship has helped me heal from the abuse I endured.

We are soft with each other, understanding, and honest. We bubble wrap our complaints to be as kind as possible. We come to each other with respect and knowing most likely, if something happened, it was a miscommunication, oversight, or mistake, and that the other person isn't malicious. It's scary speaking up and being real, but when we are both met with understanding, it just gets easier every day. Because of this, it got easier to admit things to myself about the ways I needed to change, not just for the benefit of this relationship, but also just for myself.

We have the cheat codes to each others' very specific needs. When I am sad and crying, he knows not to touch me, but to offer a shoulder to cry on when I'm ready and to leave me be until I'm ready for a hug. When he is triggered, I know he needs time and space to himself and loving words of encouragement. Because of my history of sexual abuse, he knows I need to come to him, and that being approached sets me off into paralysis. Because of his extreme neglect, I know he needs

One of the best sayings our therapist gave us is ""it's not the end of the world."" We say it with a smile. I can feel disappointed, even intensely abandoned, rejected, and feel those feelings, know it is a perception and not reality, come to the conclusion that it's not the end of the world, and move on and feel ok, within 5-10 minutes. Since our goal is to live as free of disruptions as possible, we handle our triggers, rather than react to them causing more triggers. We haven't connected or had sex in a couple of days? Let me examine this feeling of abandonment, acknowledge it, feel it, call it what it is (a trigger) and decide that it's not the end of the world. I feel like this because my inner child was abandoned, not because of any real abandonment right now. Well, it's not the end of the world, it'll happen when it happens and that's ok. Normal couples go through moments of disconnection as well. There is no perfect fairytale for anyone. We had date night planned, and I can tell you are anxious because I am feeling down and your inner child is reading it as rejection, honey, let's just eat dinner and watch a movie without expectations of romance, it's really not the end of the world! Ok, sweetie, I love you, thank you for giving me space.

None of this was easy to achieve and we still have work to do on ourselves and in this relationship. We are both committed to doing the work. We are both committed to improving in our own ways and having goals outside of the relationship, and supporting each other in those endeavors. We both want to be on the same page, but live interdependently and come together out of choice, not obligation. We are now both getting into the best physical shape of our lives and discovering and pursuing our dreams beyond mental wellness. At this point, our sensitivity and depth of emotions are more of a gift than anything. Thanks for reading.

**Edit to add**: thank you so much for the awards and for engaging, being vulnerable, and committing to growth alongside me. I feel fucking honored. It means so SO much to me...you have no idea. I came to reddit bpd in 2015 as a terrified  \[what I thought was\] broken person desperate to get better, the first person in my whole group of friends and all my family to go to therapy. This sub has grown into a force of growth, healing, and support. I'm here for you guys forever. We're in it together. Nobody feels the way we feel."
People with QUIET BPD: do you visualize yourself acting out?,826,l1jaww,122,"(tw self harm mention) When something triggering happens do you find yourself visualizing the breakdown? Like I’ll just be laying in bed completely motionless staring at the wall but in my head is a scene where I’m tearing my bedroom apart and screaming and cutting myself. I can feel all of the emotions that would come with that, too. And yet I just lay there."
Therapist gave me a piece of advice that has been working like magic,817,lx6j9r,44,"It’s incredibly simple, but my therapist told me a few weeks ago that there’s some research to suggest that using your own first name when you speak to yourself in your head can help curb unwanted behaviors and holy shit I am doing so much better with just this one small change. I think it’s because hearing your own first name is often jarring or coming from someone with authority over you, and so using it to interrupt yourself when you’re spiraling into an episode works like actual magic. It’s been as simple as switching from saying “dude stop yelling you know this is wrong” in my head to “(first name) stop yelling you know this is wrong.” The instances of yelling during arguments have decreased probably 80-90% and I am entirely blown away."
"Last night I called the suicide prevention hotline while sobbing & begging for god to kill me, today I’m singing songs in the car & loving my life",821,hx6p0f,70,"It’s so exhausting not being able to tell what your actual desires are & what is real versus not real. It’s so hard. I hate this disorder so much.

Edit: thankyou all for your kind words. it’s so nice to be in a community that truly understands what i’m going through bc sometimes i just feel so alone & misunderstood. i appreciate you all for sharing your stories & hardships in the comments, & i’m so glad you’re all still here. ❤️ much love."
Does anyone else feel so overwhelmed by the amount of stuff they have to do that you just don’t do anything?,824,gmtrrs,78,"With quarantine I’ve had so much free time, but between being a mom, taking care of our house, cooking meals, laundry, being on top of paying bills, dealing with unemployment, keeping my car clean, and taking care of myself, I feel so overwhelmed. I make lists and try to take it day by day, but sometimes I feel like I just can’t balance it all."
DAE just feel like they’re just gonna end up killing themselves one day?,816,ixt7uc,95,"Life seems so bleak to me right now. My BPD isn’t acting up as much but my depression sure is. It just feels like there’s nothing to do, nothing to look forward to, no one to hang out with, and that I won’t amount to anything in this world. Even if I don’t kill myself soon, I feel like it’s going to happen at some point. I just can’t imagine life being better than it is now. I’m not passionate about anything and everything just feels like such a chore. I can’t imagine myself getting old, between my boring life and everything going on and getting worse in the world. I feel like I know I’m going to die by suicide eventually, it’s just a matter of time."
"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just the replacement of one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""",811,miwc67,51,"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

I know the stigma attached to Borderlines in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. And it's the BPD lot who need it the most.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.


*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**"
My rapist was arrested !! (TW),799,ime6rf,61,"TW for rape, I was raped a year a half ago. I didn’t report to the police because I didn’t think anything would happen. 
A few months ago, a bunch of people were using an account to anonymously name their rapist, which I did. My own post was the most successful of them and i found another girl who had also been raped by him. 
We became chatting and since she had publicly named him, the police spoke to her and I decided I wanted to take this further. 
I got a call a few days ago to say he’s been arrested for 2 counts of rape, I can’t say how much I cried, it feels like such a victory for once. 
I’m just so glad to have something good in my life that’s perked me up!

Edit : thank you guys for all your lovely kind words!! I’ve not really spoke to my friends about it and kinda swept it under the rug, so you guys cheering me on is bursting my little heart ! Thank you! 💖"
DAE think of suicide as a natural response to any negative feeling?,804,mb1uij,94,"I have never really attempted suicide though I've come close.

Often when anything happens that triggers a negative emotion my brain goes straight to ""well I guess it's time to kill myself"" without fail. Even if it's a minor embarrassment, it's like in a list of normal responses to a situation suicide is right there at the top, a reasonable reaction in any situation.

Does anyone else do this in their head?"
When I'm in a good mood I feel like I faked my mental illness? Does anyone else relate or is it me?,806,kgf4vj,57,"This week I've barely had any anger episodes and I have felt relatively normal. Some anxiety and some mini outbursts but nothing much. I feel like whenever I feel normal or decent I faked my entire mental illness and I'm really just dramatic or it's just PMS or something (which is when my outbursts usually happen but not always). 

Am I a fraud or is this normal? I know I don't have to be miserable 24/7 but a week or two of being normal makes me think I am cured and need no therapy .."
"BPD is passive-aggressively making someone feel bad, calmly comforting them about it, being paranoid that they’ll hurt you because of it, wallowing in unbearable loneliness, and feeling euphoria from being so engaged with someone, all at the same time.",795,aa7dw3,43,"And sometimes, that person is you.

It’s my 30th birthday! I didn’t plan on living past 25. I’m so fucking happy I’m alive,787,i4u32f,67,"I was hospitalized when I was 25 because I didn’t want my life to go on. I was undiagnosed and then misdiagnosed and saw no hope. I wasn’t thinking about being 30 at the time. I didn’t see any future.

Today is my birthday and I made it to 30. Holy fucking shit. How did I survive every single day since the day I was admitted to the hospital? I dunno but I want to keep going. I’m stupidly curious about how the rest of my life will go, even if it can get really shitty at times.

We may have BPD but we’re really strong."
"I either want to be asleep, high on anything, or making a crazy drastic change",783,b1bca4,57,"Why is living so boring?? I'm only here to press certain chemicals in my head!

That's the rush of the impulsivity right? You quit a job, leave your SO, bleach your hair, move across the country, boom you're high and this is IT, who I really am! What I've always been looking for!  I'm going to stick with it this time! I'm cured! 

Buuut you're not and after a while you realize you're the same as you've always been only now you have one less option on your list of possibilities to check off. 

EDIT: Wow! It's crazy so many people relate to this. I was diagnosed in September after going to the mental hospital, then had a massive upswing following a job change, and getting a part in a play and was thinking ""wow that BPD diagnosis is so bogus I'm doing great now that was just a phase"" now I'm coming down and have had a few ""crazy"" episodes I realize I'm not better! Having everyone valid this post has made me feel more kinship with my BPD brethen. 

ALSO, opiates are my drug of choice, but my favorite cheap, legal, and healthy(ish) alternative is kratom if anyone wants to check it out. You can buy it at any smoke shop where it's legal. It's a plant that isn't an opiate but targets the same receptors and causes feelings of euphoria. "
People need to understand how much fucking emotional pain we have to silently carry within a day.,787,jyi4yd,84,"I can’t handle my mood fluctuations within a day. I can’t handle feeling fine, but depression suddenly hitting me out of nowhere like a train, leaving me numb to do anything else but lie in bed and sob.

I can’t handle internally craving love and attention more than anything, but as soon as I get it, I want to push it away because I don’t deserve it and people will 100% abandon me if I don’t do it first anyway. And I ALSO hate spiraling into deep depression whenever I even have the slightest feeling they’re distant towards me or less loving than usual.

I can’t be good at things I do but break down every time I make a small mistake or don’t do my absolute best. Which is very very very often.

Loving people SO much and clinging on to them for dear life is more stressful and nerve-wrecking than actually wholesome a lot of the time. 

Having no idea who I am because I adapt to whoever I’m with is confusing as hell, too. 

And lastly... it is the most painful to not be able to express whatever I feel because that would most DEFINITELY scare people away from me. It is the most painful to resort to letting out these feelings onto yourself and (TW) your own skin."
What makes BPD so dangerous is just how quickly one can teeter between psychotically suicidal and passably normal.,787,8rp0oj,56,"There’s no “get help before it gets worse” because it *starts* at its worst. And it gets better by the time help arrives, so things are no longer urgent, and you are unable to get realtime help dealing with these feelings *as* you are feeling them. "
"BPD is like fire and water: one second it’s an overwhelming, “I HATE YOU,” & another second is flood of tears, crying “I’m sorry, I need you,”",785,jnwhz7,64,"BPD is when you have a love-hate relationship with the people closest to you; the world; & yourself.

BPD is when people walk on eggshells around you because they don’t want to trigger you, but at the same time you walk on eggshells because - you’re afraid of them leaving you.

BPD is when you struggle to regulate your emotions and need/want so badly to tell someone, your favourite person, your love-hate parent, or Reddit, because you just want so badly for someone to understand and calm you down - 

But BPD is also when your therapist tells you, “Your dependency on others and inability to regulate your emotions is unhealthy. You need to self-soothe. Be able to be your own person. Individuate. Stop depending on others. Emotionally. Financially.”

Yet deep within you, you stare at your therapists & the world and think, “But do you really understand what I’m going through?! Do you really think I don’t want to be normal, like you?”

It’s when your therapist tells you, “I don’t know how to help you anymore,” & then you tell them “But please, this is what I was afraid of,” & then their response goes, “It’s okay I’m still going to look after you,” 

-
It’s the reality when people tell you, “You just need to find your purpose. Find your sense of self.” - Yet you wrestle because you’re always lost, you’re always searching - 

You’re searching for belonging. Stability. Acceptance. Normalcy. Love. Self-love. Confidence. Friends. For people to stay.

You do want to know who you are;
You do want to figure your purpose in life;
You want to be happy.
- 

You just want so badly to be free from the 5-9 symptoms - 

You don’t want to feel all these anger; then sadness; then a glimpse of hope; then back to, “Life is too hard, it’s too painful, I can’t deal,”

It’s when you feel like you’re a burden to the people around you;
You want them so badly to understand you; to understand this dumb mental illness, 

But will they ever?

You want to be completely free of this chokehold of a “disorder”,

You want the DBT skills to work, but it’s hard to remember the skills when your distress level is mf high; & then when you’re depressed, does it look like I wanna practise them skills? 
-


& maybe someday you will: You will have wins. You will no longer fit the traits for BPD/your mental disorder. You will have developed sufficient skills to tolerate distress; communicate effectively; practise mindfulness & regulate emotions. You will be free.

Free from bad memories. Healed from past trauma. Less emotional pain.. Successfully built a life worth living..

But today is not the day for me, (and you?)
Yes I hate myself,
Yes I’m black & white,
Yes I’m always afraid people are gonna leave me,
I battle suicidal ideations,
I fight urges to not hurt myself,
I am constantly lost about who I am,
I get triggered easily and feel everything intensely;

maybe that’s okay :’)
At least for today.

For tomorrow I’ll wake & fight all over again.
But if I lose, if I relapse, if I slide, if I attempt.. at least I’m trying not to sink further in the deep ocean, of which everyone w/o BPD/mental illness seem to be swimming fine, aite? :’)

Does anybody else kind of like wearing masks now?,777,hsnd1l,147,"Don’t get me wrong, wearing these dam things everywhere is so annoying and I wish we didn’t have to, I can’t breathe well ! but part of me really likes it. If I feel insecure, nobody can see my face and I don’t have to try as hard during my day and emotionally exhaust myself talking to people because I’m not hyper focused on reacting and seeming “normal” / giving the “correct” facial expressions. I can be my own self and talk to people without that! The only thing I have to focus now is pronouncing emotions in my voice or faking a laugh. But wearing masks for the most part have helped me feel comfortable socializing or working around people 😭 I don’t even have to smile really, and I found that I was always faking one to seem Professional or engaged !"
High functioning with any mental disorder DOES NOT mean your struggles aren’t any less severe,777,jqfg24,136,"Yes I can get out of bed most mornings, go to work, laugh, hang out with friends sometimes, etc. That does not minimise what I’m feeling internally at all. Most mornings I’m struggling to get out of bed, I laugh to be liked/blend in, I’m overly thinking about what a friend has said/done or debating if I should rid them all completely and the worst one: I’m blaming myself entirely. All of my effort goes into being perceived as “ok” because I don’t want to bother anyone. If you simply think because someone acts a certain way their thoughts have to match, it’s naive and invalidating. You never know what someone is battling in their head. Don’t make them feel bad because they don’t have the ability to openly express that. Never judge a book by its cover, right?

s/n: I thought this was pretty clear but lately my therapist has been comparing my actions to what I say in therapy and is under the assumption that I’m fine. It’s frustrating. I’m not fine. I know it seems like contradicting but it’s not. It’s exhausting to hide this all and still deal with them alone."

The big problem with BPD is 90% of your emotions are bullshit fantasy land stuff.,754,bomife,89,"- legacy emotions from the distant past (comes up perhaps subconsciously)
- living in imagination land (so so so often)

BPD becoming a trend??,743,m5nhmd,18,i need to rant because my blood is boiling. all over tiktok i’m seeing people saying they have bpd because they’re moody. and people my age on my instagram saying “omg i’m so borderline i’m such a bitch”. and i’m seeing more and more celebrities coming out saying they have bpd. what. the. fuck. i don’t want to invalidate anyone because i don’t know if they actually have it or not. but now people are making it a quirky trait.

I havent took any drugs for the past 100 days after 6 - 7 years of addiction. Thought i’d share.,732,lm76mq,43,"I have taken various substances everyday for the past 6 or 7 years of my life. It was my coping mechanism and it nearly destroyed me. I never knew i had BPD until I got diagnosed like 3 month ago. Since then I’m going to multiple therapy programs to help me stay sober and get my BPD symptoms more under control. Getting diagnosed made it so much easier for me to understand what’s going on inside my head everyday. At the end of my addiction I took 150-200mg of Diazepam everyday + liquor and sometimes opioids. Now, just a few month later I’m feeling better than ever. For the majority of my life i thought I would never be happy without taking something. Right now i cant even imagine going back to that behavior. I’m so happy about all this and I just wanted to put this out here because maybe someone feels motivated reading this. I’m really glad I found this subreddit because it makes me feel less alone with my emotions. Wish you all the best!

DAE feel like their life hasn’t “started” yet? Like you’re always waiting?,729,jilzvp,82,"I really feel this way, often, and I’m 27(F). I recently split up with my partner and have had a lot of the “forever alone” kinda feelings, but on reflection this is a thought I’ve pretty much always lived with - the idea that when I’m in a relationship, I’ll feel settled. 

Or when I get that new job, I’ll feel content. Or next time I date someone I’ll settle down. Or even - when I move to some new location, then my life will start properly. 

I’ve had jobs and friendships, things that make me feel fulfilled in the moment but in the long term I just feel like my life hasn’t started yet, like I’m meant to have had children or done XYZ by now. Again though I realised it’s not an age thing as these kind of thoughts have always been here. 

A kind of “I’m not there yet” but I don’t know where the hell “there” is, and when I think I’ve found it the goal or idea shifts again. 

Anyone else?"
"There is nothing wrong with you, you are in pain",727,i3389i,71,I wish someone said that to me. If someone needs to hear this. Your condition is real and valid.
BPD in a relationship means I’ve mentally left the relationship at least a million times,725,ljz7zi,78,"I’m soo in love with my SO. I would never leave him. It really is a test in my head of who will leave first (manipulative much?).

What he doesn’t know is that no matter how much I love him, when splitting occurs Ive mentally broken up with him and threw him out of my life so many times.
I would never reveal this to him because it’s so sad. I would be heartbroken if he mentally thought that of me.
This has nothing to do with him. I’m afraid I will have to suffer with this for the rest of my life in all of my relationships.

Will I ever be okay? Is this a dark secret I will always have to keep? 

It’s as if all the love in the world can never make me not have these thoughts. If you has me what my SO has to do to make it go away, the answer is nothing. There’s absolutely nothing anyone can do to help me but me.

What’s worst is he think he might have BPD as well"
BPD sucks,727,ffwd2g,89,"I get bored with reading paragraphs, so I'm going to lay out my dot points about the BPD experience

* Being ignored on social media instantly triggers abandonment issues
* I assume everyone hates me and wants to leave until they've reassured me for the billionth time.
* Self destructive behaviors are hard to quit
* I hate myself.
* Romantic relationships make BPD so much worse
* Medication has awful side effects and I can't stand to be on them.
* Can't maintain friendships because I swing from clinginess to distant behavior.
* Downplaying my issues so I won't be hospitalized
* Downplaying my issues because I think I'm over-reacting 95% of the time
* Being self-aware to fix certain issues but not having the will to do them.
* I don't know who I am but let's pick a random fictional character and emulate them.

If you have read this far, please know that I love you and I care about your well-being. Stay safe. <3"
I found the best app for BPD!,722,lwud1s,70,"It's called Bearable, here are the links to [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bearable-symptoms-moods/id1482581097) and [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bearable) 

I've tried so many apps but none have really worked with BPD since they're designed to track emotions/symptoms that last for weeks/months consequently. Bearable allows me to see all that, but also my crazy mood swings and every feeling I've felt in a day. I always thought that late evening/night was the best time of day but its actually when I get all the worst breakdowns. There's so much crap I hadn't realised before using it. 

Everything is customizable: feelings, symptoms, factors, just everything. It's confusing at first but absolutely worth it! 

There are so many statistics, you can see which factors cause which symptoms, how your sleeping affects your mood and symptoms, it calculates the percentage of toyal symptoms you have (I dissociate way less than I thought compared to other symptoms!). Everything. The presets are amazing, but you can add any factors and symptoms you want and see their effect. 

Please try it out! I swear I'm not getting paid for this, I'm just so exited I finally found something that works lol.


Edit: I didn't expect this to get so much attention, I'm happy so many of you found this helpful!

Edit 2: 

People have been asking for the differences between Bearable and Daylio, it's been too long since I used the latter but here's what I could quickly find:

[This one](https://bearable.app/bearable-vs-daylio-which-one-should-you-choose/#:~:text=difference%20between%20them%3F-,Features,4%20instead%20of%20a%205.) is from the Bearable website, so it could be biased. There are still some comparisons worth checking out.

Does anyone else feel like they are cured when they have a good day/hour/minute?,720,k41kyt,59,"Whenever I’m content for a little while I automatically assume that it’s all good now and that the whole BPD is all in my head (duh!) and then, you know, it comes back... My brain is a beautiful place. 😂"
I finished my DBT program.,715,i0r9q1,43," My therapist's final note to my psychiatrist says that:

1. I'm able to identify and cope with emotional distress.
2. I'm able to differentiate my thoughts from reality and I'm able to identify risky situations. This was attained through the following:

* I was educated about BPD, emphasizing that my disorder is not my identity.
* I recognized the function of my impulsivity as an escape mechanism, thus leading to dissociation.
* I recognized my cognition biases and I was able to predict, identify and avoid splitting.
* CEBT skills to cope with and challenge my BPD thoughts.
* Mindfulness, breathing and progressive muscular relaxation techniques that diminish the intensity of my physical symptoms.
* I acquired social skills such as assertivity, conflict resolution and empathy.
* I was trained in non-verbal communication.
* I learned about self-esteem by validating myself and others.
* I've been taught about self-care and boundaries.
* I've identified the importance of cognitive flexibility.

1. I've been impulse-free for the last three months.
2. I've managed to acquire a better perspective regarding interpersonal relationships, thus having better experiences.
3. Reduced feelings of emptiness.
4. I no longer experience dissociative symptoms.
5. My anxiety levels are reduced to 50% of what they initially were.

Ok... so, one year post diagnosis, and after nine months of DBT, I'm discharged. BPD will be present forever - the only difference is that now I have the tools to deal with it. The emptiness will never leave, but that's fine. I'm still dealing with the consequences of everything I did before my diagnosis. I have lost partners, friends, and my own dignity. It almost cost me my physical health, my family, and my job, but I was able to get help before it was too late.

My therapist told me to celebrate and to feel proud of myself. I still can't believe it. I seriously didn't think that I'd ever be able to cope with this disorder.

My therapeutic process, in general, is not complete, since I experience several other mental and neurological conditions, but the BPD was the most detrimental for my well-being and it has been managed, theoretically.

Yay."
having no friends is such a relief when you have BPD,717,lku3lc,116,"for those of us who have BPD, our lives completely revolve around others. The way our friends, favorite person, strangers, co workers, & family treat us, completely affects how we feel. but for me lately, i feel like i don’t have BPD. I have no friends, no FP, & i haven’t met anyone knew.. so there hasn’t been a single person in my life who could potentially trigger my BPD symptoms to come out.. if that makes sense. being lonely and having absolutely no one feels SO nice to me. its like i have a weight off my shoulders. yes it sucks to feel like i have no one that cares about me, but when i have no friends/favorite person, that means there’s no one around me that’ll make me feel like shit. it really sucks that i cant be a normal person who can manage friendships, but whatever. ive accepted it"
Does anyone else fantasize about themselves in a extremely F’d up situations?,705,i74k9d,119,"Like real bad. Nothing *too* violent, but just enough for you to feel that familiar hurt inside of your chest? Sometimes I’ll even be aware I’m purposely hurting my own feelings but I can’t stop and I’ll keep thinking about worst case scenarios. Here are some of things I find myself thinking about.

- My SO cheating on me or leaving me ruthlessly 
- Being used by someone & then justifying it by telling myself I deserve it 
- Being abandoned by my family/friends 
- being physically hurt by someone

Having BPD is like raising yourself all over again,701,j7zoqb,44,"Does anyone else feel this way. 

You go from your childhood thinking...this is normal. Then you find out not only is it not normal, now your brain is not normal either. You have to relearn everything and things you didn’t know before you can ever function on a socially acceptable level. Love is nothing like we were taught. The only boundaries we have are completely disproportionate and are always on a whim. We have to teach ourselves that there are actual ways to solve problems that don’t involve fight or flight...anger is in fact not an emotion...it’s a reaction. We’re tossed into this world that we know nothing about because ours has always been in “normal” turmoil...flipped upside down and fucked up was a way of life ... we can’t even sleep without thinking. We were told forgive and forget but all we were taught was pain and regret. 

This was a message I wrote to my brother. Anytime I have a random thought, I message him because he reads everything I write and gives feedback...he’s always willing to read my rambles even if they are about nothing.
I was thinking...as I am one to do. And wanted to find my own way to describe what I feel like having BPD is. Of course this is only scratching the surface. I want to get really in depth. While I’m here....would anyone be interested in the vlog I am starting up about BPD? Like would you interact with me? Ugh just want opinions. I’m bored."
I applied a technique from therapy and it worked great!,703,b0d6ok,37,"I was on an airplane with my fiance and he said something that made me very upset and angry. But before I went off on him, I remembered something I learned in therapy called ""pillowing"". So I said, ""I may be misinterpreting, but this is how I understand what you've just said."" (insert my interpretation) He then told me i was misunderstanding and clarified, and I felt much better. The situation completely de-escalated from there and I still felt a *tad* bit pouty but I felt good because I was much more in control of my actions and emotions, and didn't hurt my fiance n the process.

DBT really is helping my life!"
pw/oBPD should use this space as a place to learn more about BDP not teach people w/ BPD about how we can make their neurotypical lives easier,705,kzq075,79,"Rule 1: ALL ARE WELCOME IN THIS SUB 
I get that. I agree with that. I'm grateful for that.

I think it is absolutely helpful for the world at large that all are welcome here. It helps BPD as a disorder gain more understanding and a sense of legitimacy from our neurotypical peers. People w/oBPD who come here are often doing so because they want to support their loved ones and I cherish that this space welcomes that.

I'm making this post because [another post that discussed this topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/kzghj5/kind_of_weird_about_some_of_the_pwobpd_that_post/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) got locked and I felt the discussion was valuable so I wanted to bring it here in a more constructive light. Ftr, I *do* have BPD myself 

Personally, I feel like people coming here without bpd, especially if they are essentially neurotypical (no diagnosed mental illness) that they do so with the intention of seeking a greater understanding of their loved ones who do have BPD and help them in their recovery. 

If you don't have BPD and you're here to use this space as a place to ""teach"" those of us who do have BPD any sort of tips for making our relationships easier, etc, I suggest you do so delicately. These types of posts are certainly welcomed and sometimes helpful, but I feel all too often that the work is always on our shoulders. I just had a big fight with my brother today, who knows I have BPD, who knows the signs that my BPD has been triggered, who has the full capacity to take a breath himself and step back--yet he never does. And then when shit blows up it's always my fault. It is such a fucking chore trying to get him to comprehend that, as a neurotypical person, WE ARE NOT THE SAME AND DO NOT FUNCTION THE SAME WAY, and that, as a neurotypical person trying to make the brotherly relationship functional, he also needs to do part of the freaking work! It cannot be all on us.

So, sometimes, when y'all come in here with your normal brains and tell us ""you just need to x y and z and your relationships will be better"" I implore you to take a moment and step back and think to yourself ""I wonder if I, instead, attempt to learn more about how my loved ones think and operate than I can become the more evolved person, change myself, and create the environment that is supportive and healing for that person because I learned from reddit what it is they need."" 

If you don't have BPD, stop shedding your responsibly of learning and growing as a person committed to maintaining whatever functional and healthy relationship you're seeking to maintain by coming here in the first place. You play a role in that too. If your s.o, spouse, sibling, parent, child, whatever, had a long term physical illness you would show up for them and do the research and learn what it is you can do to help. Imo this space should be used the same way 

I think this would be a constructive outlook for people w/oBPD to have about this sub, whilst also reaffirming that it is not the requirement or rules of this sub and that you can choose to use this however you see fit

Don't often post on this sub just comment and lurk so this should be neat"
DAE regret what they say literally as they say it?,701,jdj5mn,51,"You know when you split on someone and as you are saying shit to them theres the other part of your brain that's like ""nope don't say that... Fuck we said it."" Feel like im arguing with myself."
Literally just had the most BPD moment of my life,701,fc2mfh,102,"Y'all I am cracking up... I was sobbing in my car and caught a glimpse of my face in the mirror and like my makeup still looked bomb and I looked like a goddess so I paused my breakdown to take a few selfies, and then continued.

Edit: hi everyone! I just wanted to say I appreciate everyone’s comments even if I am unable to respond to them all. Love and appreciate you all! Lmao Thank you for relating to me and just taking a moment to laugh at ourselves together! I just wanted to share some things in response to some of the more negative comments I’ve seen: 

1) to clarify, thinking you look cute for 2 seconds does not mean you have NPD haha, otherwise the whole world would have it. Let’s please normalize feeling confident and not try to diagnose strangers on the Internet:)

2) this is not trying to glorify mental illness at all, this is just me trying to laugh at myself being ridiculous and silly! It’s hard to feel so empty and sad all the time and sometimes you really do just have to laugh at yourself for the little things to bring a bit of humor into your day;) for all of those in such a deep darkness that you are unable to, I did not mean to make you feel worse or lessen your struggle at all. I am so sorry it’s so hard right now and I hope you understand that we are all at a different place in our journeys. I sincerely apologize to anyone that this post hurt! My intent was just to spread some positivity and laughter in this sub."
It's finally happening,697,kelpzs,99,"My husband uses my youtube at work because it's what we use on the Xbox and his shows are saved on it. I was scrolling through my search history to find a song to listen to and I saw that he'd searched how to take care of someone that has BPD and watched a 20 minute video on the subject. I feel so loved, validated and seen. I honestly thought no one cared enough to look anything up about my illness and he's shown me different and I feel on top of the world. I had been wondering why he was suddenly more attentive and understanding and now I know and I'm just so happy.
ETA that y'all can be nasty in the comments all you want, something positive happened in my life and I don't really think it makes a fuck how you feel about it."
Does anyone else feel like a relatively normal functional person UNTIL you catch feelings for someone?,699,lcp0eo,116,"I don't experience as many mood swings when I'm not romantically interested in anyone.

"I passed my masters in law with a high distinction (79%) and I am so happy, I needed to share this somewhere.",685,l7fdmr,40,"BPD has been a struggle in pretty much every aspect of my life, relationships, education, work, social, etc. For me to pull something like this off required an absolute monumental amount of energy, emotional and physical. Therapy is probably the only thing which kept me sane.

I don't know how I did it, me being me, thought I'd submitted a pile of shite. A distinction is the highest grade you can get. I am very proud of myself after the year I had last year leading up to this, but also feel like it wasn't me who did that.

I can now begin my training as a lawyer. Couldn't be happier. Everything has fallen into place and I just...can't. From a young age I had it drummed into me that I was never good enough, but I've proven to myself (and those fuckers) that I am.

Idk, as someone with BPD, achieving something always feels kinda weird because you feel like you don't deserve it. I know I deserve this, and it is there in black and white (no pun intended lol).

Edit: thank you so much for the love / awards!! I wasn’t expecting this at all. Seriously <3"
People don’t realize it’s so easy for US to be the ones to be manipulated and abused in relationships,679,bzequr,94,"“People with BPD are abusive and manipulative!”

When someone either knows you have BPD or learns your attachment pattern for them, they figure out how easy it is for them to get away with everything. For example, someone who’s your FP figuring out your loyalty to them, and that how no matter how much you lose it, you come crawling back. So they’ll be more relaxed about fucking things up, because it’s not easy for you to just leave the relationship forever. They’ll take advantage of your passion and leave you alone when you’re upset.
Does this happen in every relationship? No. But it’s not uncommon for someone to learn you have a disorder specifically affecting relationships to learn how to work with that. 

As a result of this, I’m conflicted when it comes to telling loved ones about my mental health."

bpd and work,684,kedua4,63,I had a bpd attack at my boss the other day and booked a meeting to explain myself. and i was so afraid and i explained how i have bpd and all that. and she said it was totally okay and that I can talk to her about it and mentioned how her partner has bpd and how she understands. and it made me so happy because i never thought I would receive that type of understanding especially at work. so current mood: happy :)
There are people out there who will love you even at your worst,687,k4hswg,89,"I am an SO of someone with BPD. I introduced my girlfriend to this subreddit as well as reddit in general. She is an avid lurker here and wants y'all to know that this subreddit helps a lot. 

Last night she was very upset and she was crying and venting to me for a while. After she had finished saying all she had to say, I told her this...(I'm writing this to the best of my memory of how I said it)

""One of the things I love most about you is that I love you all the time. Im sure there are plenty of girls out there that are amazing and everything when they're happy. But what makes you so special to me is that I don't love you any less when you're not happy. It doesn't matter if you're sad or angry. I love  your sadness and your anger and I think that youre beautiful no matter how you feel. I just love every part of you."" 

She seemed to feel a bit better right away and one of the first things she said to me was ""I wish I could post that to the BPD subreddit. I feel like some people would wanna know that it is possible to be loved even during the times when we feel the worst."" 

So now tonight I'm just posting this because maybe this is what one of y'all need to hear right now.

EDIT: 
Thank you all for the kind words. I started off thinking that Id respond to each and every comment, but then I realized I  was sounding repeditive in my responses. I just want to say to all of you that I'm glad if this post helped you. I'm hopeful for all of y'all finding love. 

I also want to address some comments that seem less believing of the love my SO and I have. It's okay if you feel that way. I respect everybodys opinion. I just want to say that it's true that we are not always the perfect couple. We have our ups and downs. There have been times that we have hurt one another. But at the end of the day we love each other so much and we are important to each other, so we work through things and stick with each other."
My boyfriend broke up with me and i didn’t self harm,685,gbi3i6,50,"TW

My first ever boyfriend broke up with me.
I didn’t purge, SH or tried to starve myself. I haven’t done these things in months, and there were days that were hard. 
I don’t want to be ill, I want to recover. It’s so hard. I’m so suicidal but these feelings will pass. 
This time I’m trying to accept it. It’s okay that he doesn’t want me, it’s his decision and he has the right to do so. My ED just got better and I won’t let this big ass crisis get me, I will stay strong and not give in and fall into old behaviour, the same with selfharm. 
I will get through this and it’s okay to be suicidal and it’s okay to want to relapse. I will try my best with using skills and will continue my recovery, I can do that on my own, I am my own person. It’s okay to cry. 
I’ll just have to survive this

It sucks how few resources there are for BPD and relationships that ISN'T about learning to ''tolerate'' a partner with BPD,686,jfm35y,49,"I want to learn. I want to get over the toxic parts of me.

her: 'But you could've enjoyed it? You were young. These things happen.'

me: 'I couldn't have enjoyed it if I told him to not do it and he did it anyway.'

her: 'You said yourself you were blacked out. Maybe you made advances towards him?'

Put a blanket over a toy and it may as well not exist anymore. That’s how it is with BPD, but with the people I love. When they’re in front of me, telling me how they feel, it’s perfect. My heart is full and I believe them. But as soon as they’re gone, well they may as well not exist. They must not care for me anymore. I must not matter to them. Their feelings must have changed. And sometimes even my feelings change. I can’t imagine all that loving energy, all I feel is fear that my loved one is gone! Man, the trauma is real. The fear of abandonment is real. I just want to believe that something can be real without it being right in front of me and repeated to me over and over and over until the other person is so tired of repeating themselves that they do disappear for good. "
Being self-aware with BPD is an absolute chore,672,9wq2jd,64,"It’s like, I know I’m being melodramatic, I know I’m not being rational, I know I’m not making good decisions, but there’s like a naughty part of me who wants to drink and drug her feelings away and scream at the people she loves because she’s 99.9% that everyone hates her, and then begging for them to come back. 

I think the worst part is when I let that part of me take over though. When I get tired of fighting off crazy, irrational thoughts and finally just give in. I let anxiety, anger, depression and loneliness take hold and corrupt my thinking to the point that I can think of nothing else.

BPD is a real severe psychiatric disorder,661,me5sqj,63,"My general mood is depressed suicidal, I've been just playing videogames all night. I'm back to living with parents at 27 and I feel like a total loser.

My parents decided to call some delivery food some hours ago and I went to the kitchen and they left me some food. I'm about to bite a chicken wing and the whole life situation falls on me. Father is blasting TV all volume, mother is in the bathroom checking her face. They're trying to have fun even though they are old and sick. Even though they have to take care of their mentally ill adult son, they're still trying to enjoy life. And I felt guilty. I hate these people for giving me a horrible childhood, scarring me for life. I only think about revenge. And they've only been nice to me despite my behaviour.

Then I felt guilt and I thought to myself ""I could just put on my best clothes, drink, go to a bridge then just jump"". This was unbearable depression, guilt and despair. All these feelings in less than 5 minutes. I never bit the chicken wing, I put it back on its food container.

I just went back to my room. Now I'm back to baseline depressed. I'm back to normal, just like that. I'm queing for another match of my videogame.

BPD is fucking real if any of you any had any doubt about it. From one second to another I became suicidal, guilty, angry, paranoid and delussional. Now I feel confused. As if you've ever played contact sports and you get hit hard, I feel just like that; like I just got tackled in football helmet to helmet."
Why does BPD make me have romantic feelings for someone just because we’re getting along as friends 🙄🙄🙄,660,d081ex,96,"**doesn’t find them attractive* *

-a few jokes and a few hours later -

**wants to be intimate with them* *

🙄😒"
"Shoutout to everyone with BPD, it's really hard to live with this mental illness but we're still pushing through each day.",657,j8hcjf,35,"I've been having a harder time lately again and it got me thinking.
It's not easy to live with BPD, time to give yourself some credit for your continual struggles.

I've lived with this sickness for most of my life, I don't know what's it like other than this.
But it has to be different than what ""normal"" people go through...otherwise more people would understand this curse and feel the hell burning you from within.

The constant horrifying emptiness that sucks your soul again and again, dissociation that leaves you feeling unreal, the lines between memories and reality are so blurry you don't know which one is which.

The emotions that shift like hurricanes on steroids and strike you down like King Kong stomping an ant.

I've suffered a lot in this life and done some stupid stuff as a coping mechanism for my pain, I still do.
All the time mistakes after another, breaking down over and over again mentally.

But I deserve a break, I'm still here. For reasons I don't know I'm still here trying to endure living and trying to be better.
I know I'm far from recovery but I've worked my ass off just by going through a day with this BPD brain.

I deserve a break and so do you.
This ain't easy but give yourself some slack sometimes too."
Does anyone else feel like they don’t have what it takes to live?,655,jqx0oi,78,"Not even with the aim to be super successful.

Just everyday tasks. 

- Be reliable
- Manage friendships/relationships
- Attend and work properly 
- Feed yourself well
- Go to the shops when you need to

I know my emotion mind is feeling like everyone else around me has it together, and can function and get things done. But I just feel like a very pathetic person.
I’m living with the overwhelming shame and guilt of everything I’ve done, whilst failing to see the purpose of trying when it feels like everything is already messed up anyway. 

I feel like everyone was born with something simple, that I do not have, and therefore I can’t function like they do. It just makes everything feel hopeless."
I hate ✌️ living ✌️like this ✌️,653,kgwufw,70,"The constantly random moods that pop up. I can be happy one second and then super irritable literally the next. 

The imposter syndrome. Every time I keep moderately okay I think that I’m faking everything. Like, bitch, ur alone in your own room if you lying, you only be lying to yourself. 

The second guessing. Sometimes I obsessively spam my social media, and then I delete things. Then I regret spamming, and then I regret deleting. What’s wrong with me jesus christ. 

The crazy talking to myself. I’m a talk show host, I’m my own therapist, I’m a radio host, I’m an interviewer. The list goes on. STOP TALKING TO YOURSELF PLEASE I DON’T WANT TO DO THIS ANYMORE. 

The suspicion of people close to me. One moment I can really like them and the next I can be suspicious of all of their intentions and actions and think to myself if I really like them or not. Thanks, me, now I don’t know how I REALLY feel about anyone. 

The random occasional urge to hurt myself for no reason. Sometimes doing it, sometimes not doing it for stupid reasons like I don’t want scars or people to think I’m doing it for attention. The fear I’m accidentally going to take my own life but sometimes also wanting to do it. 

The eating disorder. Am I faking it? To myself? Because nobody knows? And because nobody knows is it really serious? No way, I’m just faking it. But am I really? I hate myself for not eating. I hate myself for eating. I hate myself for binging. I hate myself for hating my body. 

My personality. Oh god, my personality. It’s so bad living in my head, imagine having to hang out with me. I feel bad for everyone around me but I’m also better than them. But I’m also not because I’m a piece of shit. But I’m superior. But I also suck. 

I can’t trust myself. I’m a paradox, a living contradiction, a hypocrite, multiple brains living in the same head and body. I hate this. So. Fucking. Much. 

If you read this far, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk. Hope you’re doing better than me."
Do you ever just take a step back and realize how unintentionally manipulative you are?,650,itdksl,2,"Holy shit, I was having a conversation with a friend and I was throwing every trick out there to get him to do what I want without even realizing it. How do I go about not doing this?"
An observation on BPD stigma from someone without it,646,g8jvs5,123,"I’d like to preface that I myself do not have BPD, I do have ADHD and anxiety and issues with emotional dysregulation  as a symptom of both. What I’ve noticed with stigmas surrounding certain mental health issues is the way people view you entirely hinges on what disorder you have. I find this entirely unfair. 

I am personally involved with multiple people who have BPD. They are wonderful, beautiful people. They have so much to offer the world and I deeply love them regardless of any issues. I understand their issues and do not judge them for it because all it takes to make the relationships work is a change in perspective and boundaries. (These people are also in therapy and working on their issues which is obviously very important) 

Now here’s what really bugs me. I have similar emotional issues because of my specific disorders but I’m viewed completely different. No one on any forum of reddit or elsewhere would ever tell my partner to “leave me because I have ADHD and will never change”. My issues cannot be cured but I am not viewed as hopeless while somehow BPD is viewed that way. My relationships can and have been turbulent but people somehow view me separate from my disorder. No one tells me to abandon my aspirations to work in the medical field because of my disorder. People view my accomplishments as inspirational and don’t downplay them as temporary states. 

How can everyone be so damn forgiving with some mental illnesses but so unforgiving with others? No one should stigmatize any disorder! It’s completely unfair and just plain mean spirited. I hate how BPD is viewed!  it seems that in any post of relationships falling apart relating to BPD, the poster is immediately absolved and unquestioned and the person with BPD is blamed for everything. As if the other person has no role or responsibilities in a relationship and immediately a victim no matter what. 

Sorry for the rant, its just been on my mind and I can’t stand it. Y’all deserve just as much credit as the next person and I hope you all find happiness and success."
No amount of guilt will change the past and no amount of anxiety will change the future,646,m1nhno,24,Something I heard today that helped a little and I thought it may help others here. Hope anyone seeing this is doing okay and if not I hope tomorrow is better than today
"DAE: Wanting sex, not for the sex",647,k7luvk,98,"You want sex, a lot, too much almost, but it’s not about the physical aspect of sex. You want something else. Something like feeling wanted and desirable. Feeling like you have value. I am not sure what I want when I want sex half the time. I’m not even physically horny when I first initiate it. So I don’t know why I want to do it so much. I only conclude I want to be wanted."
DAE ever feel like cutting off EVERYONE and completely vanish from their lives?,646,framg2,96,"I’m resisting the urge to delete all of my social medias, change my phone number and pretend like none of this ever happened right now. I’m sick of this."
Anyone else feel like the speed with which they can go from desperately suicidal to relatively normal and calm can make the believability of their moods seem unconvincing to others?,641,8u82c5,47,
I hate this disorder,638,jd6mx6,95,"

I miss you, dude. I really do. I miss talking to you more. But, what I miss most? 

Was us having fun together. People always love me so much at first. Is it the hyper sexuality? Is it how my impulsiveness is seen as a “cute little quirk” at first? “She’s so wild!”  

I’m up, up, up. Riding on this cloud of infatuation. Compliments. ATTENTION ATTENTION ATTENTION. Validation. 

I almost hate that phase. Because it makes me sad when it ends. And people fall away like dominoes. Because now my BPD is acting up. 

I’m struggling. 

But, it’s not like depression. Anxiety. My mental illness makes me ANGRY. My mental illness makes me FUKIN SPLIT. PARANOID. ACCUSATORY. IMPULSIVE. 

But most of all? It makes me so deathly terrified of people leaving me. It makes me act so out of it. That it drives people away."
"DAE hate being touched by family and even friends, but long for the touch of a significant other?",638,i2mad9,56,"i’m not exactly sure where else to post this, and i thought some of you may relate. it’s basically as the title says... anytime my family has hugged me or tried to soothe me during a break down by rubbing my back it makes me really uncomfortable. same with friends, although it’s not as bad of a feeling as with family. sometimes my brother likes to mess with me by grabbing the back of my neck and i think anyone would hate that, but it just makes me feel really weird and uncomfortable rather than something i can pass off as a joke. however, i always find myself longing for my FP’s embrace... or holding hands or kisses.. any of it. maybe it’s because all my relationships have been long distance and i’ve never had a romantic touch in my life. i’m unsure how i’d even feel if he were to hug me. yet somehow, i can’t stop longing for that feeling."
I’m a 29 year old guy that sleeps with 3 stuffed animals every night. You should never be ashamed of what helps you manage your BPD.,639,b335ao,181,"I know it sounds embarrassing, but these stuffed animals have seen me through some of my darkest days. 

Does anyone else use a stuffed animal?

DAE feel like they wanna go “home” even when they’re already there?,636,f100id,88,"I don’t understand it. I describe it as a kind of restlessness, but I’ve never really felt like I “belong” anywhere that I am. I feel the most at ease when I’m alone, but lonely because I’m not with my FP."
"does anyone else ""fantasize"" about traumatic events?",634,mhob70,70,"I often feel like my life hasn't been bad enough to justify having symptoms like this, and when this happens I end up deep in these dark fantasies of horrible things happening to me or people I know with emphasis on their traumatic effect on me. I think this is some sort of desire for people to understand what I'm going through and earn more social permission to be mentally ill.

does anyone else experience this or even have tips for dealing with this?"
"DAE have a really bad mental breakdown/episode, go to sleep after, and feel completely normal and sane again when they wake up?",632,jr0zq4,70,Literally happened to me this morning >.> I feel like I can take on the world?? Lol
How many people here don’t want to have kids because they don’t want to pass *this* on to them?,625,helh18,110,"It’s that time of my life where I’m supposed to consider having kids (per society and my parents) and while I do want them, I hate to see a child suffer because of this. I also have depression and anxiety and I know it’s genetic. 

A lot of people say that it’s half nature and half nurture, but I don’t think I could provide the pristine environment a child would need in order to NOT have anxiety/depression or BPD. 

Has anyone here had kids, and did they develop BPD? If so, how do you help them cope?"
"Healing from BPD is kind of like ‘growing up,’ except I’m in my 20’s and supposed to be an adult",623,h7btbn,42,"I don’t mean that offensively, it’s just literally feeling like that. Particularly with the identity disturbance, I never really developed a sense of self. Now I’ve started DBT and therapy and just tried to get better, slowly I’m developing an actual personality. This sounds crazy, but I’ve grown enough to have political beliefs, a favourite colour, working out what kind of decorations I like... It sounds weird, but I didn’t have this before. I don’t know if I had identity disturbance really badly, but it affected me a lot. 

The other day I got excited because I was buying a new towel and I got so happy that I actually knew what colour I wanted and liked. I’ve finally decorated my room in colours I like after years of it having barely any furniture and looking like a bare, stark hotel room. I’ve cut off friends because I’ve decided they’re actually toxic and I genuinely don’t like them, rather than keeping them for validation and to up my ‘friend count.’ I realised I love plants, and bought a load, and it actually made me feel good. I took up rollerblading as I enjoy it, and it wasn’t even someone’s hobby that I stole the idea of. I have opinions now, and I actually mean it, rather than using someone’s own views. I date people and end things if we don’t match, rather than just getting attached and immediately sinking my claws in. I know what I want to do when I’m done studying, and I have a clear career plan which I decided myself. I can introduce myself to a group of people and not sit there and think, “oh fuck, who am I?” 

It’s just weird, after years of feeling like a caricature of a person I thought I should be, I am finally realising who I am. It’s still not brilliant, but life is way nicer when I feel like an actual person. 

There was some kind of personality under the disassociation after all."
Is anyone else baffled by normal people's lack of mood swings?,621,meix34,62,"I find myself getting impatient when someone gets in to a bad mood and they don't snap out of it the way I do. 

Like say I have a fight with my boyfriend, if it ends okay then I can feel like I'm suddenly on top of the world even though I just wanted to die an hour ago. Meanwhile bf is still in a bad mood for the rest of the night because of it and I'm left confused. I used to think that they were the weird ones and now I realize I'm the abnormal one. 

Is this just me?"
Why do health professionals get so defensive if you mention that you suspect you might have *insert diagnosis*,628,lugkhh,135,"So my psychologist moved clinics and I had my 1st appointment with my new psych this week. She asked me what I would like to focus on discussing during our sessions and I mentioned that the biggest thing disrupting my life right now is my overwhelming anxiety. I mentioned that I had a slight suspicion that I may have ADHD and as soon as I said that, her whole demeanour changed. She began asking “well anxiety can often seem like that, why do you think you may have it?” in a slight condescending tone. I backtracked almost immediately. This isn’t the first time this has happened. 

I swear anytime I’ve had a discussion with a healthcare professional about a diagnosis, they’ve tried their damn hardest to avoid saying it. When I went to a psychiatrist to find out if I had BPD, she said that she didn’t believe in labels and I basically had to say “look, it makes me feel less crazy knowing there’s an actual reason why I feel this way”. It’s like the more you push for an answer, the less inclined they are to tell you. We’re constantly told “if you think there’s an issue, go to your doctor” so why do they try so hard to make you feel like your concerns for your own mental health aren’t valid when you bring it up? I’m the one feeling the damn feelings. What is it with psychs not believing in labels - THEY’RE NOT LABELS THEY’RE MEDICAL CONDITIONS. WITH NAMES"
3 weeks clean off heroin!,629,in9s3w,47,"This relapse has been super rough but I have three weeks clean today! I go back to the psych on Wednesday and I am going to ask to go back on my previous combination of meds that I haven't been on in like years, just felt it was more helpful than all these heavy meds."
"I wrote a book dedicated to other people with BPD; it’s called I HATE YOU, PLEASE READ ME",621,jvubcz,115,"I HATE YOU, PLEASE READ ME is my first published book, and it’s a collection of fiction and tweets about BPD. Although I think anyone with anxiety/depression might relate to this book, I really wrote it for other people with BPD (and for anyone who wants to understand the BPD mindset better). 

The book’s title is a reference to ‘I Hate You, Don’t Leave Me,’ the first book I read about BPD. It’s dedicated “to anyone who’s had an FP,” and it covers the whole FP dynamic, plus the mood swings, intense fear of abandonment, lack of impulse control, and other symptoms that many of us here deal with. Although the topics can be kind of heavy, the tone is more dark/sarcastic humor, like you’d see on the BPD memes sub.

"DAE wish they were around people when they’re alone, but then wish they were alone when they’re around people?",625,ijkjxu,41,"I hate this so fricken much. I’ll find myself unbearably lonely, hating life, daydreaming about being around people. And then, I’ll finally go and make plans or even decide to go on a date, and bam, suddenly the idea is repulsive and I’ll want nothing more than to slither back into the hole I came from and stay isolated. Yet, if I go to cancel my plans, I’ll immediately switch yet again and despair at my loneliness. Like wtf??"
"After a month straight of good moods, I woke up on Thursday no longer wanting to live. For three days, I felt like I was plummeting back into hell. But nevertheless, I continued taking my meds and decided to use coping skills. I’m feeling good again, and I am so proud of myself.",622,hzm46f,24,"What initially felt like 100 steps backwards, ended up being a test of strength. And I won. It was tempting to succumb to the thoughts that I had no control over my situation and was simply  being swept away by the current. But I’m back on shore and feeling better than ever. And this was no fluke. If this same thing were to have happened 6 months ago, I just know I would’ve stopped swimming and let myself drift away into the ocean for who knows how long.

I wanted to post this to share my progress, but I also did so as a reminder to everyone to never stop fighting back. This disorder is a demon and it wants to take you down. Its primary tactic is to convince you that you’re not strong enough, so that you’ll give up. But the second you realize that you ARE stronger than it, and always have been, then you have the upper hand. Some battles might last longer than others, but as long as you believe you can win, you always will.

Stay strong everyone. I believe in you."
"Is anyone else resigned to the fact that you will kill yourself one day, even if you don’t know when it will happen?",623,kd8v0g,122,"I have reached a point where I just accept that I will die by my own hand. I’m totally resigned to it at this point. It doesn’t scare me. It doesn’t make me particularly sad either.

I’ve been suicidal (or at least exhibiting parasuicidal behaviors) on a daily basis for roughly eleven months. Prior to that I was periodically suicidal, but never like this. At this point I’ve practically forgotten what it feels like to not be suicidal. Up until a few days ago, I was still panicking and trying to find some way to escape this becoming an inevitability. But the other day I woke up and just felt calm. The instinctual urge to find a way to fix my life just stopped consuming me.

Now, instead of freaking out and telling myself that I have to find a way to make the suicidal thoughts stop, I’ve come to accept that my efforts to repair broken relationships (thereby making my life worth living) are futile. I’ve come to accept that suicide is the inevitable conclusion to my life. I’m not particularly happy about it. That’s why it’s probably more accurate to say I’m resigned to the fact that I will kill myself someday.

I’m not sure when. I suspect fairly soon. I’ve inventoried my meds and I know I have enough to kill myself even though it would be an unpleasant overdose. The thought of hanging myself also frequently enters my head. It’s surreal to realize throughout the day that I’m wearing the very belt I picture myself wrapping around my neck and a doorknob.

Like I said, I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for eleven months now and have displayed parasuicidal behavior during that time. But there’s just something so different about how I feel these past few days. It’s like overnight I went from “Holy shit what is happening, this isn’t good, I need to not feel like this anymore” to “this is just how it is.”


Anyone experience this sudden shift towards acceptance of the inevitability of your suicide?"
DAE find it almost impossible to know if you are being treated like shit or if You are overreacting?,620,m4g4s5,121,"I feel like I can’t trust my brain. My husband just woke up from a nap (super cranky) and I gave him less than great news. Our son cracked his front tooth, which means money to fix it, and money is tight right now. He started getting really angry and taking his frustration out on me. Keep in mind that I had no idea he was in a bad mood, or I wouldn’t have even brought this up. 

ME: “I’ll call around and get estimates from dentists”.

HUSBAND: “NO YOU FUCKING WONT YOURE GONNA GET EXACT FUCKING CASH AMOUNTS. NOT ESTIMATES”

ME: “please calm down it’s just a figure of speech, I will get the exact amounts.” 

This is making me super anxious and scared, and honestly on the verge of splitting on him when I recognize how I feel and gracefully bow out of the exchange.

ME: “I don’t like how you are speaking to me, so this is me disengaging from this conversation.”

Then I walked into the bedroom to calm down. I was proud of myself for not having an episode. My feelings were hurt but I didn’t lash out in anger or cry hysterically. I did the grown up thing and went to my corner to calm down.

This was not good enough for husband. 

On his way out he comes back into the bedroom and says..

HUSBAND: “have fun dIsEnGaGiNg. I’m glad it’s so EASY for you”

Then he left. No goodbye, no kiss, no hug. Our little couple rule is to always say goodbye before we leave the house. I know it sounds silly but it’s a big deal for him not to say goodbye to me and he knows that.

So now I’m sitting here, fighting with the demon that is BPD, wondering if my feelings are valid. Is this me being overly sensitive, or should I feel this bad when he acts this way. 

Ugh. Sorry for the rant. Just needed to scream into the void to feel a little less alone ✌🏻

******UPDATE*********

he just got home and he’s acting super morose.  Came into the house, didn’t say a word to me, then went into the bedroom. I waited a few minutes then followed him in there

ME: are you still mad at me? (Ugh I sound so weak I want to punch myself in the face)
HUSBAND: can we talk about this when I eat something since I haven’t had anything to eat all day (except for the homemade apple crumble I made for breakfast 😒, how quickly we forget)
ME: okay, do you want me to make you chicken nuggets?
HUSBAND: sure. And btw, you hurt my feelings too.

I just nodded and walked out of the room to make his fucking chicken nuggets. 

How did I hurt his feelings???! Now I’m scanning that entire exchange in my brain for a moment where I might have done/said something to hurt his feelings?? I just told him objective facts. I don’t understand. Am I such an awful person that I hurt his feelings without even realizing it?? I hate my brain 😭😭😭😭

*******SECOND UPDATE***************

He told me how I hurt his feelings!! I honestly forgot I even said this to him. He was on a zoom call this morning and he said he would call me when he finished. I went to our neighbor’s house for brunch and he was supposed to come too. When I got home I saw that he was asleep, never called, never texted.  When he woke up I did talk to him before the tooth thing.

ME: “hey, it hurt my feelings that you didn’t call when you said you would and you just went to sleep instead”

HIM: “honestly I didn’t even think about it, I just went to sleep”

ME: “I know, that’s what hurt my feelings, that you didn’t think about me” 

I presented my feelings so calmly, no yelling, no snarky tone, really trying my best over here...

According to him, me telling him that he hurt my feelings hurt his feelings. He is hurt because I “am so tone deaf to how tired he is from working all the time”.

My head hurts guys. I think I’m the asshole here. IDK."
BPD is not cute,619,mgqeyt,50,"Having BPD means having a good day and doubting your diagnosis. It means feeling like you are a manipulative bitch no matter what you do or say. It means deciding on a drastic hair or style change to finally find yourself. It means your ""happiness"" being entirely dependent on how much attention you get from that one chosen person. It's turning something ""minor"" into something world-ending. It's turning nothing into everything and everything into nothing. It's like sitting in the passenger seat of a car and watching the driver crash into a tree without being able to do anything to stop it. It's losing the will to live over a late reply to a text. It's losing your shit over a casual response. It's constantly analysing everything you said, every gesture you made, every look, everything you didn't say, everything someone else said or didn't say, that eye contact they didn't make.

It's when asking for help feels like you're a burden. It's feeling alone and misunderstood when you're the centre of attention. It's a constant battle of questioning whether your reaction was appropriate considering the situation. It's excusing mistreatment from others, because you think you probably deserved it. It means forgiving the unforgiveable because being alone is worse. It's the constant battle between lightness and darkness, and the fear of what's to come.

It's constantly being scared of losing those you love one way or another. It's constantly asking yourself if this will be the last time they forgive you. It's the fear of those closest to you waking up one day and realising they can do much better than you. It's feeling like you are constantly duping people into liking you, because you're never quite yourself. It's hating every part of yourself, even though you don't know which of them are real. It's wanting to relieve others of your burden. It's the constant struggle of wanting to end your pain, but not hurting anyone in the process. It's the urge to cut yourself, because it feels good to feel a different kind of pain.

It's filling yourself up with goods, food or drugs to feel like you're not an empty shell and never succeeding. It's realising that every compliment or every bit of positivity gets lost immediately in that black hole inside of you. It's having an all-consuming need for re-affirmation every second of every day, because people change their minds. It's blaming every single thing that goes wrong in your life or in some else's life on yourself. It means never being relaxed because there are about 100 thoughts racing through your head at any given time. It's getting used to pain and still being overwhelmed by it every single time. It's the all-consuming wave of feeling everything and nothing."
"Rule 4 as a graphic, because wordy text posts can be difficult to engage with",620,eb1h7z,57,
does anyone ever struggle with not knowing if what you’re thinking or feeling is an overreaction? like should I say/do something or is it really not that serious? I can never tell when my feelings are actually valid,613,arxs82,60,

Never forget it and never let anyone make you feel like you're not worthy of love or affection or validation just because you have BPD. Therapist told me to try out telling others that are struggling what I feel like I need to hear, so I hope this helps!"
"DAE struggle with something that pissed them off briefly and you've moved on from it, but the thought of it having pissed you off keeps reoccurring in your brain; almost like it's trying to force you to be pissed off again?",614,khk7pl,43,"The title is probably not worded the best but I seem to have this happen anytime I don't ""stay angry"" for a long period of time. It's like being pricked every 3 seconds with this very loud thought in your head, and you start to get annoyed at the fact your brain is constantly reminding you of that situation. Sometimes, I find that if I was only pissed off for a moment or two, I can get past it by sleeping. Other times, I lose the fight and end up upset indefinitely until the next drastic mood change.

DAE do absolutely nothing day after day?,615,kppyxm,125,"I am able to get up and go to work every day to stay alive but that’s really the extent of it. I don’t clean, exercise, cook, etc. I spend most of my day in bed as soon as I have the opportunity. I absolutely cannot seem to break this cycle. Anyone else?"
Remember,612,8br4c3,33,
Being single and not having a FP is a blessing,609,m4w2ws,74,"and a fucking curse. It's honestly amazing to not have my emotional day driven by fear of another person or revolving around their communication and attention. It is also breathtakingly sad in dark moments when I feel so alone. But honestly? It's worth it right now. it's okay to not be in a relationship, or have that person to cling to like a life raft. I'm learning that in these dark moments of intense loneliness, reaching out to a FP/SO can actually be worse than sitting with it and getting through it. but fuck, I want somebody. LMAO i love BPD"
DAE feel that everyone else is “allowed” to have a personality and to express themselves freely while you have to consistently cater to how others want you to “act”?,612,jqa8h1,56,Or could this be something else? I honestly do feel like I have literally nothing to identify myself with; it feels like my body is just a physical mass of meat while everyone else can say or do whatever they want without over-analyzing each and every move of theirs since their identities are stable and have been following a very sequential pattern since their births (without any significant deviation).
I no longer meet the criteria for BPD!,610,lzpred,87,"I’ll start off with how long I’ve been diagnosed, as opposed to how long I was dealing with it prior. At 20 years old, I went to a new psychiatrist and he *immediately* handed me flyers for BPD and the STEPPS (Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving) program. I had no idea what any of this meant, but I blindly jumped in head first because my life was so, so bad at that point. I went through the initial STEPPS program, which takes 20 weeks to complete. I then went into the next level program called Stairways, but I don’t remember if that’s an acronym or not. This follow-up program takes a year to complete, building on advanced skills from the first program. I went through this second program twice because not only did it help me so much, it provided the one stable place I could go during the week at that time in my life. 

Fast forward to now, I’m freshly 27 and recently was talking to my therapist (and psychiatrist, separate convos) about my status of whether or not I “qualify” anymore. She didn’t skip a beat when she said I no longer show any signs of it. This doesn’t go to say I don’t have it anymore, since for me personally it’s all thanks to healthy habits I’ve built up over the years regarding my thoughts, behaviors, and emotions. It’s still something to continue working on— but I can now say I’m in recovery. 

I am so proud of this. My best friend’s fiancé is about to become a psychologist, and he absolutely did not believe the person presented before him was ever borderline. He’d only heard the insane stories from my past and also in his school textbooks. I don’t think he still believes it, but I was able to shed some light into what it’s like *living* with this, rather than him and his classmates only learning in their graduate courses that it’s basically a death sentence. It absolutely is *not*. 

Please just know in your heart that you can keep growing and you’re not stuck in this or like this, forever. I am now a volleyball coach, which I’d always wanted to be. I have my peer support specialist training done as well as some other mental health certifications, and I genuinely have the best circle of people in my life that we’ve all grown together through some pretty dark times. I even get to teach students at their medical schools about what it’s like to have mental illness and how to better treat us! 

I’m really sorry I’m rambling here, I’m just profoundly grateful for the treatment and support I’ve been able to receive. I got really lucky because the programs were developed at the university 20 minutes away from me at the time. Most people have never even heard of these programs, but those of us that graduated (only 6 of us out of the original 24) have been doing well as far as I know. It is a very rigorous program, so most dropped out of it due to the intensity of having to reshape your whole way of thinking and responding, not reacting to things. There’s a lot to unpack here, but I won’t get into it. 

I’m still disabled mentally and physically, but it’s far easier to live knowing that I’ve come such a great distance and to have the coping skills that I do. Literally no one from my past recognizes me emotionally and sometimes even physically, and that’s my favorite part. To know that I am no longer that person who hurt them so deeply, to know that my apologies to them were genuine and not just crap promises I was peddling to manipulate them again. Honestly, I should have put myself first in getting better...but really, I couldn’t stop thinking of all those I’ve hurt and lives I almost ruined. The guilt was killing me and I thought that through me healing, maybe it would ease their pain in knowing that I really am so deeply sorry for what I’ve done. All I could see at the end of the tunnel was peace. Peace for all I’ve affected. 

I did actually used to be a terrible person. This absolutely is not saying people with BPD are, but with myself in particular, I was tragically awful to others (also with some other catalysts at work here). I know this post is too long and thank you *so* much if you’ve read this far. 

It’s cliche as ever, but there is hope. In your darkest moments and it’s nowhere to be found, please know that it will show itself. We learned in the programs to not speak in absolutes i.e. always and never...but hope *always* comes back. You just gotta look for it sometimes. 



Sincerely, 

Someone who thought they would’ve died a long time ago and thought hope was an absolute joke.

Edit: clarity


Edit: I’m gonna address some things for clarity and confusion :) The entirety of my mental health journey has been plagued with professionals immediately noticing and saying I have BPD. I have no idea what this means and why it was stamped on my forehead. I seriously don’t get it. As far as the fiancé— this highlights a big part of my journey regarding the common misconception I’ve been met with over and over again: that we’re just insane or something and it can’t be fixed. I’m guessing there are hallmark traits that these people just notice? No idea. One clinician even went as far as saying that my life is terrible and it won’t get better. There was no follow up to this as in “it won’t get better if you don’t do ____.” She literally said it just won’t get better. Part of the problem is that the US mental health system is stuck in a stabilization model, rather than a recovery model. Basically, the program I went through is recovery based. Stabilization is just that- getting stabilized but going no further in the notion that we can improve. 

I did not say I am “cured.” I mentioned in my post that I’ll have to continually work with this and use my skills to make sure I keep myself maintained. It’s fairly known that with lots of treatment, someone can “no longer meet the criteria” as in the active symptoms are under control or gone, but still have it. That is why I said I’m in recovery :) 

The programs were heavily comprised of mostly DBT, along with components of CBT, etc. It was quite the healthy mixture of these things to compliment each other. For me, I seemed to respond to DBT the best out of the others. 

I’ll try to answer some other things as they pop up or I missed them. Thank you for reading and I’ll attempt to answer comments :)

Edit: I forgot to say THANK YOU to all those who gave awards!!! I totally thought this would get maybe 2 upvotes. I am so touched by all of the positive comments, too. Seriously, thank you!"
Does anyone else get into genuinely angry arguments with someone who isn’t there? Like fake conversations that you would have if the person was in front of you?,607,id675j,82,By that I mean when I’ll be driving alone if I suddenly get angry for no reason or even start calm I’ll be speaking to somebody in a theoretical sense as if they are responding and then reply as I would if they were in front of me and can sometimes get so angry I have to pull the car over. I have destroyed a laptop by punching it and stomping it when I tried to help somebody and they got angry because I got into a fake conversation with them and got that mad. I have also gotten so angry I punched a hole in the wall during an “argument”. Basically acting out both sides with genuine emotion.
"Does anyone else feel like that they can sense vibes and energy, and that leads them to jump into conclusions that might not be entirely true?",610,hh1p1k,100,"I have to start by saying that I’m not even sure I have BPD. I was diagnosed with bipolar and I take medication for it and I’m fairly stable, but recently I realized that I relate to BPD in a lot of ways. I’m 27 and a female, so I suppose I’m older than the majority of people here.

I want to hear what you guys have to say. What do you think about energy? Do you feel like you can sense other people’s vibes? 


I’ve always been hypersensitive, hyper aware, I can notice the slightest change in tone of voice or body language. I feel like I can pick on so many subtle things. Not just that, but sometimes I feel like I can sense when the other person is uninterested, jealous, lying, faking it, doesn’t want me around, or said their comment in a demanding way or with ill intentions. I just get the “vibe”. Not in a mystical way, but rather through deep awareness and hypersensitivity of the things around me. However, I absolutely have no idea how spot on this “skill” is. I have anxious attachment and sometimes I’m highly suspicious, sometimes bordering on being paranoid. There were a lot of incidents where I was absolutely 100% right in my judgment, but other times I wonder if it was just all in my head. That I’m actually projecting my own thoughts and anxiety into the other person and our shared space/atmosphere. Sometimes there’s some mental calculations going on, when a pattern/ repeated behaviors gets added up that leads me to these conclusions, or when I over analyze the whole thing. It’s not always just “on the spur of the moment” type of conclusions. But really, I don’t know how right I am most of the time.

This sometimes gets me into really bad situations. It can ruin a night out, or worse, an entire relationship. Specially if I start acting cold, distant, or flat out confront the other person. Whether my perspective is true or not, if it’s something that is considered rude or bad, most people will deny doing it 90% of the time. Some will even ghaslight you. And you’re torn between what to believe."
My therapist told me a metaphor today that I really think will resonate with some of you,607,dcklry,48,"Today we were talking about how I have problems regulating emotions, and I tend to overreact because I want people to hear me and acknowledge me. Personally when I have fits of rage, I want to be seen and heard. It’s like a child throwing a temper tantrum to get mommy’s attention.

She told me that it’s like when you and someone else are standing side by side in front of a house. You start to smell smoke and you turn to the other person to tell them you think there’s a fire, they say “no, no, there’s no fire.” You then start to see the smoke and you turn to them and say “no look, there’s definitely a fire going.” Once again the other person says “nah, no there isn’t.” You see the flames engulfing the house and once again say “no can’t you see the fire right there?!” The other person blows you off once more. Finally you just can’t take it anymore and scream “LOOK AT THE DAMN FIRE ITS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU!!!!!!!”

By being invalidated by other people in your life, by having you express your feelings and people in your life saying that it isn’t right or you shouldn’t feel that way, it makes you feel unacknowledged. That’s why the freak outs happen. You just want to be heard. You want validation over your thoughts and feelings.

Idk, I just through this was profound and made me look at things in a new way. I thought it might help someone else so I decided to share :)"
"does anyone else speak to themselves for hours imagining being in situation or even repeating a situation from the past and respond differently, but eventually realizes like “who am i talking to?”",609,ecezdi,58,"I spend hours just imagining situation with people I’m currently attached to and sometimes i make new scenarios, sometimes i just imagine like what if i acted differently in a past event? 
It is consuming and wasting my time and it is very distracting, i lose my concentration easily to that."
"You ever think, deep down, you’re really a terrible person?",610,fajf00,72,"I do. I think I’m a manipulative, petty, envious asshole with paper thin skin and a mentally fucked head. I upset my FP over the stupidest fucking thing.

I’ll always have this illness, I’ll always be this person. I don’t deserve to live.

Edit: I wanna thank everyone for commiserating and understanding me and for all the kind words and advice you’ve offered. I’ve since talked with my FP and opened up about my feelings. She helped me feel much more at ease and safe. I’m usually better at fighting off my demons, but I got pretty weak yesterday and today. I’m still pretty raw right now, in fact, but I’m doing better.

I’m stronger than this. I’ve won 100% percent of my battles with this disorder simply by staying alive. I won’t let this beat me."

"DAE find it difficult to believe they were once depressed when they’re happy, and difficult to believe they were once happy when they’re depressed?",598,amb5v6,49,"Whatever mental state I’m currently experiencing I expect to last from here on and forever - and I very obviously ignore the evidential fact that my moods and mental states have and continue to be very diverse.

My mind thinks that the current way I feel is the way I’ll feel forever from now on, no matter what. It makes me feel like I have no ability to even consider changing my mood in this present moment in the slightest, because now it’s my permanent reality (for better or worse), despite the truth very obviously being the opposite. I *can’t* imagine feeling differently in the future from how I feel right now.

Stop making mental illness a personality.,595,m957yt,6,"Oh you are a tik tokker who is ""stimming"" to sweet music? Oh man mental illness is so quirky and unique! It really gives you an out for everything!

Oh whats that? Those with actual mental illness have to deal with this shit daily and have other attributes and also live with the consequences of their actions? Oh man that hashtag aint looking so hot now!

I have BPD and the big S, Schizophrenia. Guess what? I love Tolkien, History, Wuxia, Comic books, Pro Wrestling, Anime, RPGs, Video Games,American Football, Hockey, Boxing and MMA. I am learning Chinese and work full time and study full time. I go to church every Sunday and am openly bisexual. I love dogs and every day I buy noodles from a place where a 43 year old chef from Lanzhou sits with me and helps me with my chinese homework because I go there after work and I learned Lanzhou Dialect just for him. I have no criminal record, I've never hurt anyone beside myself and I try to better myself every single day. I try to make peace in my life and treat others with respect and love.

Do you know what doesn't make up my entire personality? Do you know what doesn't give me an ""excuse""? My disorder. I am thriving and surviving. I am happy but what pisses me off is people who think they can use a condition to excuse anything and everything they do especially when they have never even been diagnosed. My condition is not ""cool"" or ""trendy"". Sometimes I cry because my FP is busy at work, sometimes I replay moments in my head again and again until it feels like memorizing an exam, sometimes I fucking cut myself because my memories are different from reality, sometimes I hear voices that tell me to kill myself. Its not fucking fun or quirky and fuck those who think this disorder is like putting on a new cool shirt. 

This disorder is suffering and never knowing why others can function.

This disorder is crying your eyes out when all you want is a fucking hug.

This disorder is not sleeping because you said one wrong thing.

This disorder is wanting just one person to understand and all at once understanding you are being overdramatic.

Fuck this new victimhood trend where collecting disorders is akin to collecting Pokemon. This disorder is not fun."
"I'm only BPD 5% of the time, but it's enough to mess up the other 95% of my life",594,kkihkx,43,"I'll have long periods of stability, more so now I'm older, and then I'll get triggered and do something stupid (for example, look through a friend's computer after feeling rejected). That act is often enough to irreparably damage a friendship, relationship or employer's opinion.

So because of the act from BPD me, normal me has to live with the consequences for months, if not years on end. I'm still sad about a friendship I lost years ago. 

It sucks that these friendships, relationships, jobs etc. end simply because of an impulsive act, not a slow incompatibility over time. We both still fundamentally like each other, but the bridge is burned.

So it can feel like my social group is artificially small - as in, it might seem like I'm not someone fun to be friends with, or honest and kind in friendships - but I am those positive qualities 95% of the time. However, the 5% can derail it all.

Anyone relate?"
"Does anyone else get really passionate and excited about hobbies or projects, and then lose all motivation and regret all the money and time you spent on it?",594,bkht2v,87,"This happens to me so much. I will get an idea for a new hobby or project or something I’m really into, decide it’s my new favorite thing ever,  spend a lot of money on the highest end supplies or merchandise to cement it’s place in my life, and then very shortly after I will either get bored of it, overwhelmed, or just fall into a depression and stop caring about anything including the new “thing.” 
The last thing I did this with was cosplay: I decided I wanted to go to a con, and chose the most elaborate and difficult armor to make from scratch out of foam. I wanted to spend all my free time working on my foam armor and spent SO much time and money doing research, buying materials (foam, box cutters, paint, costume templates and tutorials, etc). I even set up half of my bedroom around this project with all my tools and work table. 2 weeks later I decided I didn’t have the skill for it and gave up even though I had made some good progress. Now every time I walk by that part of my room I feel so guilty for giving up on something I spent so much money on... 

Anyone else do this? Is this a BPD thing?"

Does anyone else fantasize about fainting or having other medical crises?,594,aoyhv4,110,"I often fantasize about fainting in public, and all the people who would rush to my aid. I also imagine people (e.g., my therapist, a guy I just met one hour ago, a former boss, ex-bf, etc.) seeing it happen and being concerned. A few nights ago I had a dream about fainting on the side of the road and hoping, while blacked out, that someone would come over and try to help me. When no one did, I tried to prolong the fainting spell as long as possible and kept hoping I wouldn't become fully conscious again before someone had seen me and come over. 

I think this fantasy is about wanting others to see my pain and care, and about not wanting to be alone. I often have it when I am in a situation I want to escape. 

Anyone else? "

Enter the mind of a borderline.,588,hj4f0j,87,"• What you feel is a minor argument, always feels like the end of the world to me.


• I almost always feel like I’m right. If I’m wrong, I hate myself. 


• I constantly feel unsatisfied, you may love me but it isn’t as much as I love you.


• If you ignore me, I hate you.


• If you hangout with your friends, you’re selfish. 


• When you aren’t understanding me, or aren’t listening, I become a ticking time bomb ready to explode.


• Nearly every time we fight, I want to leave you.


• My emotions shift throughout the day, most days it depends on how you’re acting towards me.


• If I sense a shift in your mood or attitude towards me, I’ll spend the day panicking, sometimes even crying.


• If I feel like you’re leaving, I’ll try 10x harder, I’ll become submissive.


• When I’m insecure and fear you’re sick of me, I’ll sabotage things and start fights so I make sure what I’m scared of becomes a possibility.


• Passive aggression is my favorite thing.


• Everyone is always out to get me.


• High stress sends me into a panic attack, so often times I’ll start crying during a fight, you’ll think I’m trying to manipulate you.


• I’ll feel guilty after having a panic attack and hate myself again.


• My sex drive is either nonexistent or 100%

It infuriates me when people say ‘don’t use your mental illness as an excuse’ or ‘why are you acting like this’,590,gvd9ss,60,"Fuck right off. The way I react to situations is a direct result of how I process information and respond. And since I have a fucking personality disorder i am not reacting the way I do to make an excuse, that is just the way I react as a person who has to live with a mental illness. Everybody is ‘supportive’ until they are inconvenienced by your bpd. It shocks me how people are STILL surprised when I do something borderline, like sis you’ve known about my mental illness for years and yet you still have the audacity to be like ‘why are you acting like this? When my friends with depression for example are ignoring me I don’t confront them and say ‘why are you like this?’ Because I know goddamn well why they are like that. Why is this so hard for people to understand?"
Do you ever wonder how ‘normal’ or non mentally ill people think and view life?,582,lguurk,99,"I got kind of upset the other night realising I’ll never live life the way others do or have a relationship like normal people. I don’t understand how they think or view life.

Edit: Some people seem to be reading this as though others don’t suffer and other mental illnesses aren’t as awful. I’m just upset watching people around me easily make friends and have healthy relationships with others. Yet I’ve constantly been told to be “normal”, stop “acting so weird”, “why do you always over react” or “it’s no big deal” or when I’m being asked what’s wrong they don’t understand why I don’t know why I feel the way I do sometimes and there isn’t an answer. 

I just simply want to see people that think how I do and understand me and I don’t feel as weird.  I realised why I never fit in or why I say things that my friends don’t understand and it can be very disheartening and lonely not to be able to relate to those around me.

I know my friends have their own issues too but they understand each other but they can’t understand me but they try and they empathise with me."

If I offer no value, if it’s not the *most* value, to someone’s life then they can toss me to the side and I’ll be abandoned again. But rationally I know that I’m not the most important person in someone’s life because Normal people don’t rank their friends and loved ones on a scale like that. So knowing that I’m *not* the most important person sends me spiraling and like I’m on the edge of being abandoned at any moment. It’s just a constant circle of guilt, selfishness, and fear.

I just... actually passed nursing school.,580,jwqyt1,42,"Five hospitalizations for self-harm/alcohol, countless breakdowns staring at myself in the mirror crying and feeling like I would always be a failure, feeling inadequate in every single way, a devastating break-up (you guys know what those entail; a lot of self-destruction and public embarrassment), wrecking my car twice... I STILL DID IT. 

BPD is absolutely debilitating and even though I feel on top of the world right now, I know maybe tomorrow I may feel suicidal and hopeless again. And I don't want to sit here and sound all preachy and like ""you can do anything you put your mind to if you just try!"" I know how infuriating that is.

Maybe this is not entirely BPD but just a general person feeling (the world just sucks no one knows what they're doing) etc. etc. But it genuinely feels like I can't do this.

EDIT: I just want to thank everybody for being here. Making a random reddit post late at night I did not expect to gain this much attention at all. It is sad to see people in rough situations like me too, but it is also so uplifting to see how supportive and kind everyone is and I am so glad everyone is sharing their own thoughts and experiences.  I have been feeling so alone lately, and maybe it's shallow but just seeing all you people commenting here have made me very happy. Thank you everyone and know that I support you and I will be here if you ever want someone to talk to."
I'm so good at faking normal that people won't believe my problems are as intense as they are.,577,d6esmt,94,I seem so normal and happy on the outside that even my doctors try telling me I'm not very deep into any spectrum. Maybe if I didn't put crazy me away before i go to doctors or therapy I'd get the help i need. But maybe they would just lock me away.
Anyone else fall in love with anyone who is nice to them?,571,m033lc,94,"Anyone else fall in love with anyone who is nice to them? Whether it’s for a minute, or you’re secretly obsessing over them for days? Weeks? Fantasising about the way they made you feel, even if it was just a simple compliment. Or even if you just had one conversation with them without feeling like you were a burden to them. I’m in a relationship, so I keep this so strongly to myself. I try my best not to act on it as on some level I know I’m just putting them on a pedestal for something they will never remember but what meant the world to me."
DAE struggle to express the severity of their symptoms to doctors/therapist?,573,jmua5w,72,"Whenever I speak to my therapist or doctor I’m almost always already recovered or somewhat recovered from my episodes and in a COMPLETELY different headspace than when I’m having an episode or freaking out. 

Then when I go talk to them, I find myself minimizing the situation/episode to where I feel like they think I have everything under control and just need to do simple things to manage. But then when I have the episodes I’m basically on the brink of killing myself or going into psychosis every single time. It’s just a miserable feeling to not be able to communicate the severity of my disorder... 

My psychiatrist doesn’t feel the need to change my meds because he thinks it’s working just fine but my episodes have become more and more frequent and I think everyone (maybe even including myself) thinks it’s just due to added stress and big life changes."
raise your hand if you ever bought something off impulse and regretted it later,572,eosgs1,120,lololol i waste my money :’)
"Feel like if you quit dating, you'd probably be ""normal""",569,i4eoyb,90,"Almost all of my triggers are exclusively relationship based. If they love me, if they plan on leaving me, if they loved me *more* than the person before them yada yada. When I am single, I am an almost fully functioning individual (probably leaning towards the more impulsive side but still within the realm of socially acceptable).

If I had no boyfriend, it truly would **no problem** in an extremely literal sense. However, I feel empty without one. I can't just love myself. I need someone to love me, so I guess the cycle will always continue.

I haven't been without an FP since I was maybe 15. How do you guys do it? I'm tired of feeling like I ruined a possible future with every man I date."
Having bpd is wild,573,iu97pp,97,"That bpd feel when you go from fighting with your boyfriend to listening to depressing music, having a breakdown to doing your makeup and feeling 'ok' again all in like 20 mins and only feeling okay because he messaged you he loves you"
"DAE ""forget"" feelings for people/their FP after a while of not seeing them?",577,hlj94w,101,"I have this thing with my bf. When I'm with him usually I'm full of feelings for him.

If we are apart, then even after a few days or so it's like I ""forget"" and my mind goes into negative thoughts. I start feeling annoyed at him even though we haven't talked / he hasn't done anything. It's like I forget the good stuff and my mind creates bad stuff.

I don't really know how else to explain it. It just feels like a bit of distance or time apart changes feelings quite significantly, from loving to resenting, for reasons unknown or created in my mind."
Quiet bpd,575,azjo0p,113,"Any other quiet borderlines here? I feel like nearly all the rage is directed inward at myself, so much that a lot of people Im close to will never know just how bad I can get. I don't usually explode at people because I'm too afraid of damaging relationships so I let people walk all over me, unintentionally. I just isolate myself when I'm upset and self harm. I know better (done dbt twice) but I'm not feeling mentally together enough to fight this.
I also feel like I'm extremely boring and too socially awkward and people become disinterested really quickly. At times i really question whether I have bpd or just a really emotionally unstable flavour of adhd. Anyone else feel like this?

Edit: Also hopefully this isn't breaking any rules but if anyone here wants to dm me I'm always looking for peoplel to chat with :)"
Being a self-aware borderline is so hard.,572,cfy198,59,"It's like being a narcissist but at the same time being an empath. It's like being dr. jekyll and mr. hide, but remembering everything, being both at once yet sometimes only one at a time. I can both love deeply and do horrible things to that person. And I feel it all: the guilt, the desire to do good to the person I love, the fear... I feel crazy and I guess I am. But at what point do you throw your arms in the air and give up? Say, ok, you know what-- I'm a horrible fuck up and I'm not worthy of anything good and I'll never change so I guess I'll stay here."
Does anyone else go through phases of not wanting to talk to anyone for a long period?,569,m70p2g,73,"This happens to me pretty frequently. It can be a day, week, or even a month where I have zero desire to try and talk to people. It just doesn't feel worth my time. I don't know it almost feels like its not enough, like its too much loss for not enough gain. I hate feeling this way because I feel bad about missing out with my friends but sometimes Id rather die than talk to anyone. People have been starting to get worried and I think a lot of people think I don't like hanging out with them. I do, I just don't have the mental energy a majority of the time. Its pretty frequent too, and happens at least once a week. 

How am I suppose to get better if I keep isolating myself? Trying to push myself to hang out with people, but half the time I just want to go home and lay in bed. However, I will go to the end of the world to talk to my FP, and that's the only person I want to talk to a majority of the time."
I recovered from BPD!,571,ikrfcx,138,"I'm in therapy since I'm 17 for BPD. Now, at 24, my psych told me that I'm almost recovered from BDP. I still struggle with depression and substance abuse, and mood swings, black and white thinking, impulsivity etc will never disappear totally... But he says I'm almost recovered because I don't ""act out"" anymore!! Apparently, I learned how to manage the consequences of my emotions!!

I'm still far away from being sane but this is a slreally big step!!

I hope this will give hope to some of you 💕"
Does anybody else find most people extremely boring?,569,mj9ytt,80,"They can be super lovely people, very interesting in the “ordinary sense” but I’m still just super bored. 

There’s maybe only 2 people in my life I don’t find boring or struggle to keep a conversation with/flow. 

I manage it and just ask questions to get answers, so it’s not an issue with me being unable to communicate, I just find them and the interactions boring? Like I’d just rather not talk. 

Does anybody else struggle with this? 

Thankyou!!"
Does anyone else hit themselves?,569,js3jde,200,"I’m afraid of blades and I don’t cut myself. But I do hit myself especially when I’m really depressed. Punching myself in the legs, slapping my face. I feel childish that I do this but I’m wondering if I’m alone."
Does anyone else suddenly become aware that they are a real person and feel intense dread?,567,gwiqze,46,"I will just be walking around campus or to the grocery store and doing something as small as accidentally looking at my own shadow will set off this devastating reaction where it hits me that I am a real person that physically exists and is perceivable to others, and I feel so much overwhelming self-hatred and this crazy need to hurt myself, but then it passes almost immediately when I get home and it just resets and happens again the next time I see my reflection or go outside."
Does anyone else also feel like they’re half sociopath and half empath?,570,eh33lv,53,"Sometimes I’m super empathetic, caring and understanding. Other times I feel like a complete sociopath.

I feel a lot, or nothing. I care and obsess over someone, or don’t care at all and they piss me off and I feel superior. It’s like I’m half sociopath/narcissist and half empath. It constantly switches. 

I also sometimes feel like an edgy teenager where I wanna randomly break the law and do stupid shit, Ive got good social skills, flirt and can manipulate anyone, and other times I think I have aspergers, no one likes me and I’m awkward. 

Anyone else feel the same way?"
"Does anyone else crave constant attention, but not actually want the constant attention that is craved?",565,lykr8b,59,"Its like my mind is always telling me I need more, I need my fp to be even more obbsessed with me.
but I actually wouldn't be able to cope with constant attention, as I hate feeling smootherd."
So I threw a pot of boiling water over my face,566,lb5ruu,61,"I don't even know what to say, really. Like I just didn't want to see my face anymore. Was taken to the hospital, but am with my dad currently. Mom's gonna come by to change my bandages tomorrow and someone from the psychiatric hospital will be in touch regarding future treatment.

I've been dissociating more than usual as of late and today marks four weeks since my FP blocked me. Oh, and the one person I've been in regular contact with finally got fed up with me. I'm feeling pretty calm and serene at the moment, but that might be all the painkillers talking. Most of today's a sickly kind of haze.

I dunno. I just want to be okay finally.

happy men’s day for my boys with bpd!,564,jx5b9q,65,"guys have it really rough with mental health. we are expected to be strong and independent, mocked for being weak, and society intends us to take on the brunt of its heavy lifting. much of the time it feels like it doesn’t care and uses us as cannon fodder. it’s far harder to struggle through all this with a severe mental illness like BPD, so i just wanted to say well done, you’re doing so much better than you even know. and remember, boys help boys, even when no one else will."
tired of people romanticizing this disorder,566,hyrmun,137,"blocked facebook because all of the BPD support groups on there are trash, full of people who think having a PD makes them quirky. i can't take it anymore. tried opening up, and they decided to call me a terrible person when i vented about things. ummmmm that's literally part of the PD sweatie but go off Stacy since you """"""""""clearly"""""""""" know so much about this disorder lmao

i literally punch myself in the head and abuse family members, as well as my fiance thru manipulation tactics and self harm. how the fuck is the PD quirky? no one wants to talk about the dark side, only how \~\~\~\~anxious\~\~\~\~ it makes you, and ""mY 30 dIFfeReNt pERsONaLiTiES!!! LOL zOMG raNDoM!!!!!!!!"" and ""aGE rEGrESSiON so CUTE teeHEE"" like shut the fuck up. this disorder has fucked up my LIFE and makes me avoid getting help because i'm addicted to being a victim and run from my problems. this disorder has ruined me. i'm fucking broken, and you're fetishizing this disorder by making it look like sunshine, rainbows, and sparkles.

well then fucking take it then. take all of it. all of the angry outbursts, all of my self-harm, all of my complete meltdowns over basic, trivial things literally ANYONE could handle (like being out of shampoo, not wanting to take the dog for a walk, ya know, BASIC FUCKING LIFE), all of my abusive, manipulation tactics i learned to fucking survive my abusive household, all of the fake suicide attempts because it's the only way to get my point across since that's the only way my parents paid attention to me. you know what? take my shitass childhood too that fucked me up to this point since you wanna be Borderline so bad. take the abuse my dad put me through, military style torture tactics like shouting when all is calm, waking you up in the middle of the night to tell you he doesn't want you and dropping you off at your mom's, who doesn't want you either and abuses you because of what your father TOLD YOU to tell her. take the bullying and all the other bullshit i went through.

take all this stupid shit, wrap it up in a shit-covered present, and fucking shove it up your ass. my PD is NOT a fucking cutesy little personality quirk teeHEEEEEEE. people suffer because of this. I SUFFER BECAUSE OF THIS. get fucked. rant over.

ETA: i did not expect this type of response from the community. i feel so validated and like i've connected with you all. it feels nice to talk about all of these dark feelings, what we've done in the past, without fear of being judged. i know we don't like thinking about it, but it feels so cathartic to talk about it, admit to it, and then letting it go. we all deserve to get better and beat this monster. i hope everyone can get therapy and the tools they need to get better.

ETA 2: Apparently, the way i have worded this post has triggered a lot of people. i'm sorry, i never meant to trigger ANYONE. this was a post marked as VENTING, which i came here to vent because i posted in a FB group discussing extensively how, when i was younger, i used to fake suicide attempts for attention and to get my point across to my abusive mother. i was attacked in said FB groups, called a terrible person, told i deserved to die, and other things. so, i came here to vent but my anger was misdirected, as usual. i'm so sorry if i triggered any of you. i take full responsibility for my actions, and should have journaled this instead of posting but i just had to let it out. this is an extremely sincere apology and a huge fuck up on my part. i'm high on the narc scale, and forget how my actions and words affect others because i'm caught up in my crisis. i forget other people are having one.

i'm going to now avoid this subreddit for about a week instead of just moving on with my life because that's what my BPD is telling me to do and i'm just gonna do it cause it's easier. thank you for coming to this clusterfuck of a ted talk."
Giving up on love as part of recovery.,570,fa1imx,46,"BPD is a disorder characterized by intense emotions, and as a result we crave intensity. In life we seek things that are deep enough, powerful enough, extreme enough to match the extremity of our inner worlds. 

However, healthy functional life doesn't accommodate those extremes. In a healthy, functional life, those extremes are a sign of crisis. They're meant to be rare-- they're abnormal. 

This applies mostly to relationships. In love I crave intensity-- I want it to be overwhelming, I want to be overwhelmed. I want every moment to be consumed by that person; I want to be consumed. 

And I've had those relationships before. I was in an abusive relationship since I was 8, and by so many people who came and went when I was a teenager; I learned to love while being abused. Those relationships have the highest highs, and the lowest lows, and now anything less doesn't feel like love. A non-abusive relationship feels like an absence of passion. Why doesn't my SO love me *that* much, beyond the point of morality?

I've had friendships and relationships that meet my need for intensity before. They're intoxicating and exhilirating and they feel incredible and they're so short-lived and so so destructive for both me and the other person. I've only ever felt loved by people who, in a perfect world, I never should have even met. These relationships-- these heights-- aren't compatible with recovery. There's no place for these sorts of relationships in the life I'm building for myself.

So as part of my recovery, I'm radically accepting that I may never feel loved again. I'm accepting that most people around me-- the healthy, stable people who I know make my life better-- will never be able to reciprocate the extremes of emotion I feel for them. I'm accepting that the intensity I crave isn't real love; that real love, healthy love, is slow and steady and doesn't engulf, but serves as a foundation to build on. I'm accepting that I need to have an identity of my own, which will be forever separate from anyone else, and that isn't loneliness, it's just being. 

I know I'm loved, even if I don't feel it. I know the life I'm building is a good one compared to what I've come from, and that recovery is worthwhile. I know that within me is a teenage girl who's desperate to feel loved by the people who hurt her, and that she doesn't need an adult to relate to her by finding new people to hurt us, but an adult who can shower her in the healthy, nurturing love she needs. I'm trying to be that adult. I want to be that adult for her. And if I need to give up on 'feeling loved', then I'm willing to do it.




EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect this to resonate with so many people, but I'm glad it did! To clarify: I'm currently in a very healthy long-term romantic relationship, although I struggle daily with not feeling loved enough, and struggle to accept that my SO will never 'love' me in the unhealthy intense way that I crave, precisely *because* she loves me in a healthy way and wants me to be well. We can all still be loved and be loved, even if that love doesn't take the extreme form we sometimes wish it would. Much love to everyone here, I'm so thankful for this sub and for the knowledge that I'm not the only one going through this <3"
Worst Part of BPD,563,eqrdtd,59,"The worst part of my BPD is the insecurity within relationships. When I'm attached to someone, they become my entire world and its crippling. I care so deeply about how long they take to reply to a text, how long they've been active on social media, or their tone of voice, or text style changes,,, because I'm so deeply afraid of losing them that it brings physical pain. I care so deeply. Too deeply. Too intense. Too much. I'm always too. much."

Just because I have BPD doesn’t mean I’m abusive,562,b1jdln,121,"Fuck everyone who thinks that BPD=abusive.

I have never ever once been anything akin to abusive to anyone. 

Fuck you for saying its “likely” and that my bpd “must not be that bad” if Im not an abuser.

Fuck that bullshit

“What do you do all day?”,566,k29j3h,77,"Someone asked me recently how I spend my time after I told them I haven’t worked or studied for 2 years (he knows I have bipolar (amongst other things) and health problems). I find there is implicit judgment in this question. 

I answered: “Surviving.”

And ain’t that the fucking truth. Here’s a shoutout to anyone who feels guilty about not achieving enough or not where their peers are at. How can you be expected to do that when everyone fibre of your being is just trying to survive?

Fuck the judgment. We still alive. We have strength beyond what these dickheads can contemplate, even if no one can see it."
Anyone else struggle with extreme irritability ?,562,ll9vsm,81,I hate this. Nearly everything makes me feel irritable or angry today and I have pretty much zero patience. Then I come off as a rude b\*tch. I don't want to be like this. Ugh. Anyone know of any ways to stop or calm this irritability ?
"DAE feel pretty “cured” of their BPD for a week or so, then plunge right back down?",560,ivpasv,52,"I’m soooooo tired of this shit lmao. I was pretty happy and proud of myself for pushing away my urge to break down and lose it when my FP did something with her friends instead of me for a couple of weeks, but earlier when I was talking to her she mentioned sitting in on a gaming stream with a friend (the exact same thing I was happy about myself not freaking out about earlier) and I just..... fucking burst into tears on the spot. It felt like I was being pulled back down a long dark tunnel I thought I had left far behind me. I’m absolutely miserable now.

Edit: Holy shit thanks for all the replies (and my first award)! I can see now that we’re all suffering a similar fate. I’m still convinced it can only get better from here though. I resolved things with my FP (though— she is my girlfriend of 2 years and we have known each other our whole lives) and I’m.... feeling better now, even quicker than usual. I hope everyone that commented on this post has some sort of unexpected windfall. I love you all so much. Keep your head up, and we’ll see through these dark times, I promise."
i love you guys... but bpd does not make you an ‘empath’,560,ggeroa,142,"okay this is a little rant, because the number one thing i see on this sub is ‘people with bpd are such empaths’ while simultaneously seeing the rest of society view people with bpd as a form of sociopathy. it’s interesting to me that such extreme statements can coexist, but i guess that’s the nature of bpd.

the truth is, we are simply the diagnostic criteria we meet (there’s 200+ different combos but not one actually specifies anything about empathy) and our own personal traits and comorbidities. we can be empathetic or unempathetic like every other human on earth. there can be trends in the way that manifests but i think it’s inaccurate and potentially dangerous to subscribe to either extreme including ‘bpd makes you empathetic’.

there are multiple different types of empathy, cognitive and emotional. there’s also emotional sensitivity and i feel like a lot of people with this diagnosis realise they feel particularly intense emotions in one of these areas and so call themselves an ‘empath’. but the reality is if anything studies show the trend may well be in the opposite direction, people with bpd are more likely to struggle with empathy. and that’s okay. you are not defined by your feelings but your actions and intentions and simply struggling with empathy does not mean you are ‘bad’, plus it can manifest in different ways in different people. some people with bpd can feel completely normal empathy. some people with bpd can have such decreased levels of empathy that they simultaneously meet the criteria for aspd or npd. some feel so overwhelmed by their intense internal experiences that there’s no room to feel for others. some people with bpd can be very much dissociated and numb to empathy, and feel nothing at all for some people or situations even though they know logically they should be and may or may not empathise cognitively. some people can feel like they feel all the emotions of the world but not have the coping skills to handle that (e.g. have breakdowns triggered by how badly they feel for the people in for example, a news report on tv). some can be very observant and empathetic emotionally but not know how to make sense of it cognitively (e.g. notice very quickly that someone’s mood has shifted but struggle to put themselves in that persons shoes to understand how and why, instead concluding that they must have done something wrong, or the person must be angry when in fact the person might just be tired/need the toilet/have a headache/etc). and some people, if not most, can be all or some of these things and more simultaneously or depending on their mood. and all of that is entirely natural, okay and doesn’t inherently make you ‘bad’.

but i think it’s important that we drop the labels of ‘empath’ or ‘hyperempathic’ because i fear they do more harm than good. i know i’ve said and done some hurtful things but not understood because i had labelled myself as an ‘empath’ due to feeling emotions so strongly, so how could i be the one whose being unempathetic? in reality, i was the asshole and online communities validating me as ‘empathic’ and somehow special was just creating an environment where i could continue being an asshole. and i don’t want other people to fall into that same trap.

at the end of the day, someone who is truly an ‘empath’ would not feel the need to label themselves as such, they would simply just be, because empathy is part of the normal human experience. it’s completely understandable that we gravitate towards labels like these, they appear to make sense of our struggles and can distance us from the bad in the world and counteract some of our insecurities. but we can easily fall prey to slight narcissistic tendencies/superiority complexes, and actually hinder us in understanding ourselves and ultimately healing.

it can be really hard to let go of ideas like that, especially if you’ve been clinging to them for a while, and honestly for me coming to terms with the ‘darker’ sides of bpd and that actually i have been the bully and the inconsiderate asshole, not just the bullied and the victim of the world’s inconsiderate assholes (bit of an understatement there lol), has been one of the most difficult things in my life.

with that said, however your bpd manifests is not your fault and you did not choose this. you are not a bad person for feeling how you do, but by recognising reality, we can heal and make change happen. i know this might not apply to everyone, but i just wanted to say, please take a look at and challenge the labels and concepts that you hold onto such as the perception of yourself as being an ‘empath’ and ask yourself if they are accurate and healthy to keep around, or if you’re maybe not as empathetic as you initially thought but clinging to that label for another reason? (e.g. to stay in denial about your past mistakes, to detract from your disorder, to find a sense of identity, etc).

remember there is no right or wrong answer to the above question and we all worthy of recovery and love no matter what. nothing is too bad to heal from. no one is too broken to be fixed. we are all on similar, yet different paths, but i am with every one of you, and i wish you all the best.

(sorry if this post was a little negative or triggering, this is just my opinion i felt needed to be said but i don’t mean any harm haha)"
I have officially made it 9 months without selfharm and I'm happy to still be alive.,564,jvejsa,28,"I spent ages 8-25 wanting to die and finally hit my lowest point on February 16, 2020. I had been in inpatient and partial hospitalization in the past but never gave it my 100% effort and mostly had bad experiences.

This February my therapist told me that she could no longer help me if I didn't seek a higher level of care and recommended a residential treatment center. Up until that moment I truly believed that no matter what I did or how hard I tried I would always be living in darkness. But something clicked in my mind. I told myself I was going to take treatment seriously and give it my 100% all.

I did 1 month of residential, 3 weeks of virtual (because of COVID-19) partial hospitalization, and 3 weeks of virtual intensive outpatient treatment.

And my self-hate turned to self-love. I no longer have the desire to harm myself. I genuinely want to be alive and am able to see all the good things about myself and see all of my strengths and see the good things in my life. I no longer need others to determine my self-worth. I am capable of holding down a full time job after a year of unemployment.

Selfharm used to be a daily thing for me at its worst, but quitting wasn't as hard as I thought it would be because I actually like myself now. I have developed much healthier coping skills. I'm going to get tattoos over scars when it has been a full year.

2020 has actually been the best year of my life. And even though I still struggle, I've never been so happy to be alive. ♡"
so I'm a psychology student and experience a ton of stigma in the discipline toward BPD. yesterday I decided to speak on it.,560,jp5x4q,51,"Albeit it was online (on r/psychologystudents or check my post history if you want to read it), but I did say it. I talked about the stigma and the trauma it causes me and that I was afraid because these students are eventually going to become therapists who hold those same beliefs against us. I got some really positive feedback from actual real psychologists and other professionals in the field. And it gives me hope. I just wanted to share this to remind you that there are still good professionals out there who have empathy for us."

I got a job!!,554,f5fjfx,57,"2 years ago I had a breakdown, was hospitalized, lost my job, and spent the next year and a half spiralling in a haze of alcohol, anxiety, and depression, rarely leaving my house.

I've been to 4 job interviews in the past month, and today I finally got offered a job. I'm going back to work! A year ago I couldn't even have gone to a job interview, now I'm actually going to be working again!

I know it's not a big deal, I'm just feeling really proud of myself and wanted to tell someone.  It's just a waitressing job, nothing fancy, but I'm happy."

I'm in a healthy relationship, looking forward to starting an excellent career in the next few months. Haven't self harmed or contemplated suicide in a while. Things are a little bit okay.",552,kfbugi,24,"Just wanted to post this and say recovery is more than doable. I was diagnosed with BPD 5 years ago and in that time also received diagnoses for bipolar, PTSD and bulimia as well.

I'm 26, I never thought I could have another relationship let alone a healthy one with good boundaries. I have a long arse history of sexual abuse, being groomed, abusing medication, failing at university three times before I forced myself through it in the last 13 months - I'll be completing my final year in April 2021 after attempting it for the first time in September 2013.

A lot more has happened, but I'm not here to write my sob story.

I'm here to say that regardless of all the bad, once you get rid of all of the toxic triggers and re-evaluate your perspective on everything (that takes days, weeks, months and years and ends up being a lifelong mission as you learn from your mistakes), the red flags become orange, and when you do start really learning from your mistakes, vices, triggers and anything mad, bad or slightly sad, those flags become green and you learn to move on.

Bad days still happen. Even though my boyfriend is emotionally healthy, I still struggle a lot. It took several toxic and abusive relationship, and around 10 other guys I also dealt with/almost ended up in a relationship with, but I learned from ALL of those mistakes and unexpectedly found myself in a relationship that's teaching me to be *in a relationship*.

Anyway, I just wanted to say, I always used to think life was one constant bad moment. After spending the most part of the last decade making the necessary changes and healing, it has finally started become okay. My biggest lesson was making that huge decision to want to become healthy - because that's a hell of a lot harder than just giving up and hurting, self harming, thinking about ending it, etc.

But I did it.

And I hope if anyone reads this, you can also make that decision sooner rather than later."
i just want people to like me as much as i like them,560,l3kvg9,41,"that’s it’s really. i always say that the kind and caring things i’m always trying to do, i expect nothing in return, and it’s true! i don’t hold others to an expectation. i don’t mind messaging first or checking on people who’d never do the same for me... just would be nice for once to have that love and eagerness shown back, or shown by someone new. 

i don’t know, it’s all fine, but my hearts been ripped up so many times there’s none left on my sleeve, but i still find that love in me for others. 

such a fight to find it for myself though. 

if no one has told you today, you’re important, you’re loved, you’re going to get through this. i love each and every one of you x"
Anyone else not have the mental strength to work?,553,j2o8sr,95,I literally cannot keep a job. I constantly quit because I don’t have the mental capacity to deal a people and have mood swings and outbursts where I wanna cry at work. I feel constantly judged. I constantly quit and find another job in hopes that it’ll be different. I need money but I just can’t work at all. Anyone go through the same thing? I feel so alone in this. My family constantly makes me feel like shit about it too
TW: suicide... DAE feel suicidal one second & then completely confident about life the next second?,553,jlwkqm,50,"I’ve been feeling this way lately. literally every aspect of my life is so bad right now & it literally makes me want to die- i feel like there’s no way around all the issues that i face. it gets frustrating knowing that nothing ever goes right. but then after a certain time of feeling that way, i suddenly get this wave of emotion that makes me feel like im on top of the world and can overcome anything. i tell myself the positives in my life but then QUICKLY turn to feeling numb/suicidal again. its such a range of emotions that switches so quickly & i feel like every 10 minutes i switch from these two moods. so annoying."
i'm tired of being so intense,552,huln8p,93,"i'm so tired of always making such a big deal out of Everything. and most of all i hate how i'll get all worked up and cry and scream and go over the same thing in my head a million times only to realize twenty minutes later i'm blowing things out of proportion. that's the hardest part to me, going through that level of emotional intensity and then realizing nothing is really happening and feeling like an idiot for not realizing how trivial the thing i got upset over was"
DAE feel overwhelmed just by trying to function like a normal person?,553,iitmur,83,"I go through the motions; I work 40 hours a week, buy groceries, pay rent... but it feels impossible. It feels like any moment I’m just going to collapse and I won’t be able to keep doing this anymore. I’m so tired every day after work, too tired to do anything aside from lay in bed, doing anything too hard makes me exhausted.

I think it’s funny how I’m probably too ill to work but I do pretty well at work. I think I’m actually just too dissociated at work to really feel as overwhelmed as I am in the moment. I don’t remember most days at work; I don’t remember most days.

I guess it’s a bit of a cry for validation that it’s not just me. I just feel so trapped in this cycle of work eat sleep that I’m barely able to maintain. I’m terrified that I’ll lose my job and not be able to work again because I won’t have the motivation. I regret taking out a car loan. I wanna quit my job and never leave my apartment again."
Casually suicidal.,549,lgc23f,66,"How many of you can relate to this? 
I’ve been spiraling out of control recently that started with anger/rage and now I embarrassed myself so badly at work in front of everyoneI feel like I just want to give up and crawl into a hole. I’m suicidal but not going to do anything if that makes sense. I can’t leave my loved ones but damn, do I want out so badly. My emotions are all over the place and soooo incredibly painful."
"DAE find it hard to buy clothes, because you don't really know what you like or who you are?",557,ijyz85,60,"I like looking at clothes and shoes and bags, but I hate to actually go out and shop when I need something, because I don't know what looks good on me, or what I even try to be. Do I want to be goth, or prep? Good or bad? Flowers and lace or all black? And money is an issue, so it has to be one outfit, not several so l can decide later.
Its so hard...shoes are the worst."

Ex messaged me today to hookup after 3 months and I am proud of myself!,547,mk6qf5,63,"So we hadn’t talked for three months, I messaged him March 19th to see what was up (he promised me that we would talk as time passed and I held onto that so I wanted to see if he’d keep his promise. At this point I didn’t really care at all about actually talking to him). He ignored that message completely. 

Today, Easter, he messaged me saying “hey, I know it’s been a minute, but do you wanna hookup? Strictly that.” Back in December he asked the same thing and manipulated me into giving consent. 

And now, friends, I am proud today to say that I did not reply to his message at all. I deleted it and continued rather than giving him a piece of my mind and say everything I’ve wanted to say for 3 months I realized that would do nothing and he hasn’t learned at all from his behavior so it’s pointless. He just embarrassed himself. He looks like a joke. And now I feel like I’m the one who has control.

This is such a big thing for someone with BPD and so I’m happy with myself. If I didn’t learn from my last mistakes I wouldn’t be doing this."
About to go into a job interview for a mental/behavioral health hospital I used to be a patient in when I was a teen.

"DAE go between wanting to make friends and talk to people, and wanting to shut everyone and everything out?",545,jpxdgk,35,"It’s hard to explain. But I’m sure you guys know that feeling.

One day you’ll crave friends, relationships, etc. you’ll go out and try to achieve it. You’ll spend hours texting or talking to people and have a blast doing it. You’ll feel good about yourself.

Then the next day it’s like nothing. You don’t want anyone or anything. You just want to be left alone. You don’t want to talk to anyone. A notification on your phone will piss you off. But you’ll flip back in 2 days."

"Today, I went to the store.",542,lbj4r3,48,"I went out to the store, today. Alone. I only had one anxiety attack. This is progress for me, figured I’d celebrate it here.

I’m not a shitty girlfriend,539,kx3fle,61,"Being borderline has made my social life into a long list of blocked phone numbers. I have one real friend, a few sort of friends... I guess. I’ve been a shitty friend. I’ve been a shitty daughter. I work insanely hard not to be either of those and distance myself when I think that’s all I can be. Mental illness is not an excuse to deliberately cause emotional harm to people who genuinely love and care about you (I will note that many of the blocked numbers should absolutely be blocked). But I’m not a shitty girlfriend. I don’t know how it’s possible sometimes, but I need to recognize that it’s hard work to not become emotionally manipulative or codependent, but I put in that hard work. And even when I feel like the world is crashing down around me, I don’t attack him. I don’t forget our conversations, our boundaries, and his love for me, even when the bpd goblin is screaming that he hates me. Yeah, every once in a while I cry in front of him for 20 min about a sandwich I dropped but he’s used to it and now he just wraps me in a blanket and makes a new sandwich. I judge myself harder than anyone I know judges themselves, but I am actually stupid if I think I am a shitty girlfriend. I am a goddamn star at being a girlfriend and it’s worth every damn DBT acronym.
TLDR: I have decided to try harder to acknowledge how hard I work to have a happy and healthy relationship, and to be grateful for it."
I can’t believe this disorder sometimes,541,hz9bbh,30,"I’ve been talking to someone for a while, he came over to my place on Friday and we ended up connecting on a much deeper level than we ever have before and had one of the best conversations I’ve ever had followed by some of the best sex I’ve ever had and I felt ecstatic, probably the best I’ve felt in months if not years. After we were done I went to the washroom to take my makeup off and when I came out he was gone, I immediately felt like throwing up, started feeling disgusted with myself and him and felt like I’ve been played/used you name it and I wanted to text him a paragraph tearing him apart, 30 seconds into my meltdown he walks into the room and turns out he just went downstairs to get us water. The fear of abandonment is so real that I always assume people are about to leave me it’s like I almost want it to happen to prove something to myself"
DAE feel an unbelievable amount of jealousy from seeing people have healthy relation/friendships on social media?,543,fyh7we,56,"Every single time I see someone have fun with their friends or a loving partner on any social media I immediately start spiralling and get extremely jealous because I do not have that. It results in me deleting the apps off my phone and completely isolating myself from seeing anyone be happy with their network of people. I have always had friends but they are getting scarcer due to me not talking to anyone because I don’t want to hear about who they’re dating or whatever amazing friend they just found. I hate this part of myself immensely but I genuinely cannot handle seeing people thrive when I am not. It’s hard because I need validation and attention, but since I cannot get it from people in my real life I resort to Tinder and other dating apps just to get compliments from people I have zero interest in. It’s a dark circle I feel like I’ll never be able to break out of. I can’t tell my friends about it either because I don’t want to be manipulative and evil so I just completely ghost and let them be.

Edit: Thank you all for the upvotes and comments, it means a lot to know I’m not alone in feeling like this. I’m trying my hardest to be better for the people around me, I do not believe I am a bad person or have any ill intent towards anyone because I am so compassionate and love my friends and family dearly, but breaking out of that dark and brooding mindset is such a struggle. A lot of the time it’s hard to know what feelings are real and what aren’t. At the very least, we can all find comfort in eachother ❤️"
Anyone else get random bursts of energy/motivation that mentally exhaust you when they suddenly disappear?,542,flowf0,54,"My days usually go as follows: wake up feeling confused, depressed, and barely able to get out of bed. When I finally do roll out of bed, I start to feel random little bursts and ideas to be productive. As I start to do these things, I quickly begin to drain again and want to crawl back in bed and hide beneath the covers. Usually my anxiety is racing around in my head flapping its arms back and forth which makes me head feel like it's screaming. And then I'll get really intense bursts of energy and I will jump up to go do something right away (workout, paint, draw, write, cook, etc.). And then as I'm doing it I very quickly become drained and feel like hiding away again. By the time I go to bed I feel extremely anxious, self-loathing, and suicidal. Its so fucking exhausting and my head is just constantly yelling at me. I fucking hate this disorder."
DAE wish something really terrible would happen to them so people pity you?,543,k12h7d,142,"I find myself fantasizing about awful things happening in my life so people will pay me some attention. I will hope for the death of a relative or getting cancer or other things of the same nature. Usually it’s when someone close to me is receiving more attention than I am. I want to be the focus. I want to be hurting more than others. I want to be nurtured back to health. And if none of these terrible things do happen, I will typically lie and tell people that something awful is going on with me, when there isn’t.

Edit: I appreciate all the comments greatly. I’ve realized that this behavior may not be vain attention-seeking after all. It’s impossible for others to outwardly see our struggles with mental health. So, by having a physical ailment or emotional struggle that most others would relate to, it will give us the attention we truly deserve for the very real struggles we deal with internally every day. We just want to be seen. Unfortunately, we have to go about that in certain ways that your average person would empathize with."
DAE feel like they NEED to be the number one person in someone’s life?,535,kfpe2a,63,"i know even just “ranking” your friends isn’t even something i should do and i don’t think i have a #1 myself and i don’t want one but i always feel like i need to be needed by someone more than they need others or i’ll start feeling like they replaced me and will leave because they have someone else even though that’s not how friends work?? like i don’t want to be anyone’s “number 1” but i want to be theirs still and when they introduce me to a friend i didn’t know of no matter how long they’ve known each other i always think “it’s over now, you’re replaced” and it makes me feel so awful :(

I fucking hate being high functioning.,540,a3igez,66,I hate being high functioning. I hate that in school and at work I give off this stoic image and everyone loves how much effort I put into things but they can't see that I'm internally fucking freaking out and over reaching myself. They get this idea that I'm this perfect strong guy with his life on track when In in the shower I break down and cry. I still miss my ex girlfriend. I haven't had an FP since losing her in may. I genuinely feel so fucking alone. Yet all I hear is praise for being there for others and doing everything and more. I just want to be held. I just want to cry. I don't want to die because I feel like too many people depend on me already and I can't let them down and that stresses me out. I just want a fucking hug.
Small victory: I quit my OnlyFans!,532,ka7keo,47,"The past year or so I’ve had an OF which was a never ending stream of quantifiable validation. I checked it constantly, every day, over and over again, and bothered all of my partners to “make content” with me. It was something that grew out of an insanely promiscuous phase, like, 3 new partners a week before the pandemic hit. Sex work was initially a really positive step — I started valuing my time more and avoided constant sexting with the infinite randos who made me feel loved but would inevitably infuriate or hurt me. Putting a paywall on my sexuality was a huge step forward, but sexual attention still ruled my life and structured my days.

This fall I decided I was ready to get clean from sex addiction altogether. Not just managing it “safely” or valuing my time and body more or setting new rules every week to feel in control... actually, seriously, learning to live without cheap sexual attention IRL or online. I didn’t think I’d be able to do it because I’ve been addicted to sexual attention from men for well over a decade but I pushed through and used my skills and played piano and cried and texted my gf dumb shit and watched tiktok and time passed and eventually... I stopped caring.

I still need a ton of validation but I’m ready to seek it through something that matters more than bigdickmike99 commenting “nice” for five bucks a month.

PS - no shade on people for whom promiscuity and/or sex work is the right thing. This is my own addiction and way of managing my BPD pain and trauma and overwhelming fear of abandonment, but many if not most people can manage a healthy relationship with sex and sex work, and that rules"

DAE hate being forced into isolation but love that the whole world is slowing down with them?,531,fk57nj,31,"I’ve had a rough year and would wake up and go to sleep crying for awhile wishing I could press pause on the world for a second so I can have time to be by myself and think. 

Being forced into isolation sucks and is driving me crazy in a way, but I’m also pretty happy right now. When I’m in a down mood and stuck on my couch I feel a lot of anxiety because the rest of the world is moving on without me. Now I know that nobody is doing anything either, I’m not missing out on anything, I can sit and process my emotions in peace. Everyone is trapped like me, except my prison is usually my own mind and theirs is this virus right now."
My mental health problems are not an excuse for my actions,533,gjlupt,30,"I've recently had a very humbling and edifying experience that I wanted to share. 

I've struggled a lot recently wth extreme mood swings and black and white thinking, as well as becoming very paranoid with my friends. I felt very left out one night when my friends were playing videogames without me, so I lashed out at them. I thought I was entitled to be hurtful and angry towards them because I had cried so much beforehand, but this just wasn't true. It's never okay to hurt others because you're feeling hurt. 

I am very blessed to have very patient, understanding friends who forgave me for my immature actions. Having conversations with them afterwards, I learnt a lot about the importance of taking responsibilty for my actions. 

Prior to this, I had the belief that because I had been hurt a lot in the past, I had the right to be unreasonable to other people. I had also thought that my mental health problems were an excuse for how  behaved. They may be the reason I act that way, but they are never an excuse. 

Having mental health problems really sucks, and i found it very tempting to give in to reckless impulses and hurtful behaviour because these things had labels that I could use as excuses. For example, I'm splitting on someone, so therefore it's fine to be horrible to them, or I think in black or white, so therefore it's okay to treat people as villains and enemies without any reason.  

But I've found that I can grow more as a person when I recognise these issues I have, and take responsibilty and actions to overcome these issues, and build better habits. I'm not completely separate from my mental disorders, I mustn't relinquish control to them because 'that's just who I am'. If I did that, I would just be in a stagnent state of personal defiance, never wanting to be better. Don't get me wrong, it's very important to accept ourselves and our shortcomings and limits. However, with that acceptance comes the duty to treat others well despite the problems we face. For instance, I know that I can suddenly feel very angry and impulsive if I feel down, so I recognise that fact, and I am more careful to not put myself in situations where those emotions cause harm.

Okay, so this was quite a long post, but thatnk you for taking the time to read it. I hope I can keep growing as a person and that we can all keep growing and building eachother up :) stay safe friends"
This Rupi Kaur poem is super BPD,534,9y1s64,25,"i dont know what living a balanced life feels like

i dont cry i pour    
when i am happy    
i dont smile i glow    
when i am angry    
i dont yell i burn           

the good thing about feeling in extremes is        
when i love i give them wings           
but perhaps that isn’t               
such a good thing cause

"When you hurt someone you love, hating yourself isn’t productive nor is it an equivalent to holding yourself accountable.",537,gcafyy,29,"Instead of turning on yourself and saying “I’m a piece of shit, I hate myself, I deserve to die” etc, try approaching it with the mindset of “My actions have hurt this person greatly. What caused those actions, and how can I prevent making the same mistake in the future?” Showing remorse is okay and so is apologizing, but when you suddenly turn it on hating yourself this can be seen as manipulative and like you’re trying to be the victim when you’re not. I know it’s easier said than done sometimes, but hating yourself will not fix anything and will send you down a cycle of destruction to your relationships as well as yourself. By saying you hate yourself and that you’re a piece of shit, you’re declaring that you are beyond help and that you will always be this way, but you’re not beyond help and there is hope for change. 

You owe it to your loved ones and yourself to not give up on yourself. No matter how many mistakes you have made in your relationships, you are not a lost cause and there is always hope that you can do and be better. You can’t change your past, and you might not be able to bring back people you’ve drawn away, but from this moment onward you have complete control over your actions. It takes monumental effort, but that effort is worth it, if not for yourself then it’s worth it for your loved ones. 

It is possible to hold yourself accountable for your actions while being kind to yourself. I’m not perfect and not all of us are in a place where we can have these conversations with ourselves, but in time, with conscious effort, you can get there. Know that you probably will never be perfect and you’ll still have moments where you spiral down into self loathing, but those moments are fleeting, and when they pass and you find yourself in a better place, you can use them as an opportunity to reflect and learn. 

I am the biggest culprit of hating myself when I hurt people, and I’m only sharing this with all of you because this is what’s helped me. I am not above anyone else in this community. We’re in this together and I believe in each and every one of you!

EDIT: Wow, this post blew up in ways I didn’t expect! I’m so happy that so many people are finding this post helpful, and I want to thank everyone for their kind words and thank whoever gave me my first gold!"
Anyone else feel like they are always waiting for something? Like waiting for life to start?,528,fbinu1,81,Perhaps this is another way to explain that empty/nagging/longing feeling we BPDs often have? I always feel like I’m waiting for my life to start...I’m 31 🙈
Where's all my self-aware borderlines at?,530,985xhs,92,"https://preview.redd.it/c10k4baxrpg11.jpg?width=749&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1224bb5052b644d90a0f5123af916c0bca97c7b

It's so incredibly frustrating to *know* you're acting on emotion rather than logic, but being unable to stop it. It's like I'm a passenger in my own brain and I'm trying to tell the driver (who is also me) to fuckin' chill, but they can't hear me.

I thought I didn't experience dissociation, but sometimes when I've been in severe crisis mode during an episode, I feel like I'm watching myself rage from outside of my body. It feels very surreal and my rational mind is like, ""Stop! You're making it worse!!"" but my emotional mind (aka BPD) has full control of my words and actions and is like, ""Oh you think that's bad? Hold my beer.""

I've just been thinking about this recently, because I relapsed just when I was doing so well. But we all know that recovery isn't linear, blah blah, but it's still so humiliating to know that I made a huge scene over something trivial (fun fact: alcohol does **not** help this situation). My roommate and boyfriend could obviously see that I self-harmed, too, so that was also super embarrassing. I'm so lucky they haven't written me off yet. But I'm determined to go the rest of the year without absolutely losing my shit."
How “empathy in people with BPD” was explained to me,529,ldqte7,68,"Okay so I commented this on another post about how people with BPD can seem either overly or underly empathetic towards other people, depending on the situation. I always thought of myself as a highly empathic person, but there are also times where I have 0 empathy. This aspect of BPD always kind of confused me until someone actually explained it to me in detail at one of my first DBT groups. 

The analogy they used was this: 

“Imagine it in terms of cameras. When you’re a baby/toddler you have 1 camera pointing at yourself. As you grow older and become more aware of other people, you get a second camera. With people who didn’t have developmental trauma and/or neglect, this second camera is pointed outwards. This helps you understand and relate to other people because you can compare the inward camera (what you feel) to the outward camera (what they feel). People with BPD have 2 cameras, but (due to their upbringing and development) both of those cameras are pointing inwards. This is why a lot of the time people with BPD are either overly or underly empathetic. They can only judge a situation based off of how they would feel in that situation, and due to the emotional disregulation, they either overly empathise with how they think you feel (because that’s how they would feel in that situation) or not empathise at all because they don’t understand why you feel that way (because they wouldn’t feel that way if the roles were reversed).”

It’s a pretty basic analogy and there are obviously a lot more nuances, but it really honestly helped me understand a lot the first time it was explained to me that way."
I’m sick of feeling like I need constant validation or everyone hates me,531,jnakxp,17,"like god damn i’m so annoying. i make a tweet, i get no likes, oh no that means every single person who saw it, hates me, thinks i’m stupid and wants me to die. my friend didn’t reply to my text within a few hours? even though i also do that? they hate me. people drift away from me because that’s what happens when you get older, people live their lives and sometimes people fall apart, yet i feel like i’ve been cut off when i haven’t. i’ve done every thing i can possibly do alone. i need help. i need therapy. i’m so sick of this. i’m sick of being annoying and clingy and having high expectations that can never be met. it’s made it easier knowing that i have bpd but without treatment i can’t really get better. and my desperate attempts to be likable are getting pathetic. 

doesn’t help that i finally moved out of an abusive situation and then less than two weeks later i get in a car crash and almost die but ya know. life is just peachy.

edit: thank you so much to everyone. i was not expecting my vent post to get so much traction. it’s nice to be reminded i’m not alone in this feeling. luckily, therapy is more in reach that it’s ever been but it’s still a little ways off. i appreciate you all so much and all of your messages made me feel better."
"One BPD trait I’ve noticed is treating everyone of your sexuality like you’re in a relationship with them, and having trouble knowing the nuanced differences between “friendship” and “relationship”.",530,b7p9dd,68,"* Saying good morning and good night.
* Giving updates on what we’re up to.
* Sharing every interesting thought.
* Emotional commitment.
* Treating failure like a breakup.
* Sending Snapchats all day.
* Jealousy.
* Not liking to hear or experience any reminder of them being in a relationship with someone else of your gender.

I find myself rapidly switching between thinking in terms of friends and thinking in terms of a relationship without knowing it or understanding why. Like I’ll suddenly start questioning “do I like this person? am I going to ruin the friendship? am I going insane?”.

DAE shut themselves off from people and notice no one reaches out,529,m31doo,65,"I know that friendship requires effort in both parts, but sometimes I just get it in my head that everyone will leave when I show my BPD traits because historically thats what happens. I have a couple of people that care about me, but the rest of my friends I fight hard to not be toxic, whether its jealousy or feeling resentful theyre not giving me enough attention. That if I distance myself from people to see if they check in always ends up making me feel no one one cares.

 I try my best to feel like I'm worth something to people and that they would care if I was gone. No one knows the struggle I go through every day to fight to be here and I'm incapable of asking friends for help for fear of being to negative. I normally keep topics light and am the first one to message because everyone had stress in their life but it doesn't make me not miss being able to be open with someone without being rejected or branded too depressive.

 I feel like I dont have a right to feel half the way and I dont have an escape so I frequently od or hurt myself and hide it because it scared people. I just wish people made an effort to check on me every so often so I dont feel so worried that theyre distancing themselves from me. After all how can I trust myself to know the difference between paranoia and intuition that someone needs their own space. But then again even my expectations of people seem problematic in their own
 
I am constantly wanting to not be here to take my burden off anyone who actually cares because the attention I want is just not realistic"
You’re not a Borderline,526,klb46z,57,"This is just a friendly reminder for whoever needs to hear it. You’re not a borderline. You are an individual with borderline personality disorder. There’s so much more to you than just your disorder and anyone who labels you as a borderline instead of a person can go F themselves. 

P.S. Sorry for swearing but labelling people by their disorders really infuriates me to no end.

Edit! Looks like some points need to be clarified. 

If being referred to as a borderline is how you like to go, it’s totally okay and nobody should say otherwise. If the label is coming from a place of genuine intentions, it’s perfect and that I’m not debating. My post is a reminder for people here who have ever felt like being stripped of their sense of worth just because they are “borderline” that they’re worth more than just their disorder."

"Do you ever get extremely, even obsessively, curious about what kind of person other people think you are?",531,dp78ns,60,"I feel like every time someone makes a comment about me, even something as simple as ""I thought *you* might like this"", I have this need to ask the other person a lot of questions regarding myself. Like, for example, ""why do you think that? "", ""would you define me as x? Why?"", ""what am I really like?"", ""do I come across as the kind of person who would enjoy x?"", etc. I think it has to do with the lack of self-identity that comes with being BPD, but I was wondering if anyone on this sub feels the same."
Our BPD is not an excuse for shit behaviour,532,7v7au5,122,"I'm not going to comment on posts trying to justify other people's decisions. I'm perfectly happy to give support to others and offer up my own experiences etc. But when people are consistently making wrong decisions, something needs re-evaluating.

We need to take responsibility and not play the victim, we'd feel so much more empowerment and confidence if we did this."
I'm in a healthy relationship,529,gtss6c,35,"And I'm fucking killing it.

After years upon years upon years upon years of dealing with BPD and having it turn all of my relationships to shit, I took almost 2 years off any relationships to heal. And I did exactly that.

I experienced life, embracing all the negativity so that I could learn to cope I'm a healthy way. I've grown A LOT in this time and learned so much about how to be healthy and deal with things in a healthy way.

And now I'm in a relationship. I wanted to take it slow. Me. *Me.* ***ME.*** But my boyfriend is the one who's going a little faster than I'm comfortable with. I would never ever have dreamed of the day I'd be saying *that*.

I'm happy, I'm healthy, I did it all on my own with zero support or medication whatsoever. (Excluding Stoicism. That was the greatest game changer. r/stoicism for the curious.) If it wasn't for minor infrequent episodes, I'd go as far as to say I'm no longer borderline. But it's part of who I am and I've learned to accept it, love it, hate it, and most of all, deal with it and let it make me stronger, wholesome and more fulfilled than anyone I've ever met. And this was long before the boyfriend."
Being constantly gaslit by your own mental illness so you never know if you're just overreacting or if there is an actual problem.,529,92qq0d,23,I want to get off this ride 
DAE feel like they can only be friends with mentally ill people?,521,ltmoap,107,"Bruh whenever I talk to ‘normal’ people I just ghost them cause I feel like a fraud.

Idk, does anyone else do this?"
Having a FP Is a Unhealthy attachment,527,kf5i27,129,"I see so many posts of people wanting to “find the perfect FP”. 

YOU ARE YOUR OWN PERFECT FP. You can’t put your all into someone like that. You can’t sit there and think “oh I jst haven’t met the perfect FP yet”. 

No. 

Having an FP is an unhealthy attachment. They could be the most kind, understanding person in the world. The attachment that we have for them is very unhealthy. 

I used to always want an FP. This year has been huge for me in self-reflection and discovery. 

We have to become our own fps. The reason other ppl dnt create them is because they can form secure, healthy attachments to ppl. 

That’s why when u try to explain to someone else what it’s like to have an FP they won’t understand."

I don't know really how to articulate what I'm thinking right now but I just want everyone here to know that they're not alone and that there are others out there fighting the same fights, dealing with the same struggles. There are strangers out there (like me) who care who you are, who see you as the fragile sensitive people you are and not the monsters we make ourselves out to be.

Whoever you are out there, I love you for the person who you are deep down inside.

Be gentle to yourselves, we also deserve a modicum of love and happiness despite what we tell ourselves.

Stop invalidating people’s DIAGNOSED MENTAL ILLNESS!!!,527,k93n9g,88,"The other day a family member told me, “uhhh I don’t think you have BPD. Isn’t BPD supposed to make you, like, loud and crazy? You’re quiet” 

Lol.. Yikes.... I did not need to hear this. After years and years and years of close self evaluation and even after being diagnosed, I still question it. This makes me question it a whole lot more. 

BPD isn’t one personality. That was so hurtful to hear. I feel invalidated. This is exactly why I don’t speak about BPD to ANYONE!!! Both that family member and my mom have said that I’m “too calm and quiet” to have BPD?? 
Oh, but they don’t see the splitting. They don’t see the mental breakdowns every few days. They don’t see the self harm, the EDs, the feelings of hopelessness, the secret feelings of violence. Among everything else!!!

Mood journals are a joke. My therapist said it would help “notice patterns” and express emotions. All it shows is that I’m unpredictable and there is no pattern to my moods.,525,lsg39u,82,The journaling also reminds me I have no friends to share my issues with because I cannot even make friends even when I try. They probably sense desperation. Sorry I’m human and I wish I had a fucking friend. But I also know people annoy me after a while so I don’t make the best of friends. Someone to have heart to heart convos every now and again. Share secrets and have long talks. But actually hanging out with people gives me anxiety and I’m not socialized as a kid so I say or do things I think make people see I’m “off.”  Or their beliefs really go against mine and I cannot let it go and I just stop calling.
When you get into an argument with someone do you immediately think everything is over?,525,leygar,73,"I feel so dumb because apparently this isn’t a normal reaction? Whenever my SO and I argue it doesn’t take long until I’m hyperventilating in a corner thinking he’s going to leave me. Even with friends, family. Even if it’s a small disagreement I just think they hate me. I bought this up to my therapist and she said that people can disagree or even argue about something but that doesn’t change the way they feel about each other... Does it really not?? I just find that hard to believe.

Never knowing which of my feelings are rational is eating me alive,520,kdjdes,40,"Am I crazy? Do I deserve to be angry? Should I feel guilty for being so angry?

"Does anyone else have a hyperfixation or an interest that makes you feel things, but the second you’re done you get extremely depressed?",524,f4t73g,77,"Okay this sounds very weird and specific I know. But over time I’ll get super obsessed with a show/movie/actor/etc and I’ll spend tons of time doing research, watching it, thinking about it, drawing it, writing about it etc. In the moment I’ll finally be able to feel emotions and get happy (sort of manic sometimes too, but it’s a nice change from just feeling empty and depressed all the time). But the second I finish it (like finish watching the show/movie) I’ll get super depressed and empty. Like worse than I felt beforehand.

Does anyone else experience or relate to this? I feel really alone"
Does anyone else feel like a different person after they watch a show/movie?,521,ccjchq,80,"I don't know if this is normal (doubt it when it gets to this point) or a bpd thing but I've been this way for as long as I can remember. Whether it's something about fantasy (elves, magic, vampires, etc), drugs/addiction, a documentary, high school comedy/drama, etc etc etc. I feel like I'm consumed by it and that's me. Example, right now I've started watching Euphoria and instantly I felt myself dissociate, go into a darker mode, think like a character, become sluggish, wish I had drugs, want to become a bigger mess and die. So this show is putting bad and risky feelings into me. Some shows/movies make me bubbly and pleasant and act like someone else. It's not me being easily influenced because trust me, I'm really not in general. But this always happens with things I watch. Am I just off or does anyone else know this feeling?"
Why is BPD not treated like a physical illness?,519,k58reu,116,"I physiologically cannot calm down during an abandonment crisis - that part of my brain doesn't work. The anxiety is crippling. The emotional pain that accompanies my emotions - fear - grief - love -anger - is so intense that I'd do anything to relieve it. Everything in my life, from the decisions I make to the way I connect with people, is focused on relieving my pain. As I result, I'm sure I'm annoyingly self-centered and selfish - like a toddler emotionally.

This is not my fault. I try and I try and I try. My emotional regulation skills would probably far exceed the average person if my brain actually allowed me to physically calm down - the herculean effort it takes to maintain normality when your baseline state is emotional pain is certainly a skill. I can certainly try harder, and find new ways of trying, but why can't the people around me see this? Why can't my loved ones see that I'm sick, that I'm hurting, that during a crisis I need help. And is it so hard to help? Put your arms around me, tell me you'll love me and never leave. That is all I need. Is that so difficult? I guess I ask for that too many times or something.

And we are demonized - people with BPD inspire unbelievable hatred from people we've been in relationships with - but this is not our fault. We are working with the limited emotional capacity that we've managed to develop according to what nature gave us to work with.

I thought this MedCircle video was useful: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0LE2jug9D0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0LE2jug9D0)

I guess the science is catching up, but where is the compassion? Why must I be treated like a monster? I truly try to be a good person - to make the people in my life happy. I don't want to hurt anyone, least of all those closest to me."

"DAE crave sexual attention and people ""simping"" over you even if you aren't interested in them?",524,k7y4kj,73,"Even though I'm only interested in dating women, I still want guys to be sexually attracted to me and want sex. I also like it when guys simp over me. My ex-BF still does it and it makes me feel so special and attractive. He calls me a model (I'm far from it), sexy and says no other woman is more attractive than I am to him, he fantasises about us having sex a lot and says nobody has ever made him want somebody so bad before. Also says that he'd always get back with me in a heartbeat if I ever ask him out again. It makes me feel like I'm actually attractive and good enough. He's such an amazing guy and nobody has ever fulfilled my intense needs like he did in our relationship. I worry that it's narcissistic to want a woman to be absolutely smitten by me and treat me like he does. I have a very low self-esteem and I still crave validation and compliments from others. I know I should be validating myself and not depend on others for this validation or only think I'm good enough if I'm getting compliments, sex or women wanting to date me. It's just that I feel so, so good and happy when I get all of the above. 😣 I absolutely hate that I cannot be happy with myself and need others to make me feel desirable. I know it's selfish. I'd kill to be secure with myself, find myself desirable and see myself as good enough."

I met a lovely guy and we're very similar in that were both introverted, want to connect over deep meaningful talks and we are both sensitive.

I opened up to him over Skype today saying that I am worried that I won't remember him and if we don't talk, my brain will tell me that I was dreaming him and our interactions never happened.

He reacted in the most heartwarming way possible! He told me he was going to send me frequent letters in the mail (he lives abroad) and my favourite Hot Cheetos just so whenever I doubt myself, I can just read and hold the letter to remind myself that he's real and there for me.

It was so meaningful that I cried right there and then. I feel on top of the world."
i expressed myself calmly during a disagreement with my boyfriend!,519,m20plw,60,"a few nights ago, my boyfriend and i got into a huge argument because i had been selling nudes over the course of our relationship even though he was comfortable with it in the past. 

when we used to fight, i would behave like some sort of feral animal. i'd cry, scream, self harm and physically prevent him from leaving. afterwards, i'd be overwhelmed with guilt and would beg him to forgive me. it was exhausting for both of us.

but this time, rather than freaking out, i listened to him and then calmly expressed my feelings. the conversation went very smoothly and he later told me that he was going to break up with me but because i behaved in a mature manner, he's giving me another chance. 

i've never been so calm in a confrontational situation before and it really was amazing. i know it's not much but i'm very proud of myself!"

Fast forward to the past few years and I really want to get back into it because I used to have a sense of pride and belonging in books, but every time I tried to stuck to it I'd get bored or disheartened, something would come up in life, etc.

Edit: Thanks for the replies!

DAE sometimes feel this pure rage that's completely disproportional to the triggering factor?,512,kaln65,44,"CW suicidal thoughts.

My anger is always held in until I just can't take it anymore. A lot of it comes from the accumulation of and frustration over little things. I also suffered through physical and emotional abuse as a child, so I've had to unlearn a lot of toxic behaviours I picked up from my family.

Here's an example:

I did the majority of the household chores, shopping and cooking when I lived with my ex-boyfriend. He was the spoiled, beloved only son of doting, loving parents. I was the oldest of many siblings that often took on a parental/babysitting role since my parents neglected a lot of our basic needs. He got pretty comfortable relying on me, but he did improve somewhat with a talk or two, but it wasn't easy.

His worst habit was leaving dirty dishes everywhere for me to pick up and wash for him. I would ask him to help with the dishes and he would agree. But, of course, it was not that easy. He would keep forgetting or just assuming I would take care of it if he didn't feel like it. I don't know. But the more I kept asking him, the more my anger would build up. I hated that I had to nag him to do it. Why couldn't he just do this one simple thing? Why did I need to ask him every single time?

So I tried talking to him about it. He'd roll his eyes or just say I was monologuing and that I didn't need to repeat myself. Nothing came from it and he kept it up. The rage kept building, but I had kept it together.

I finally figured that this was a battle I had to stop picking. However, I was not happy that he'd leave his dishes everywhere. So, why not come to a compromise? I asked him if he could just put his dishes in the sink, I would take care of them. He seemed happy with that. But of course, he just kept forgetting and I would keep picking up the dishes and I was this huge enabler.

And then one day, there was this plate on our table that he had left after eating.

I loved this asshole so fucking much, but this plate was there just telling me that he didn't give a shit about me at all. He did other things to show he cared, but this was just too fucking much. I just wanted to work this out easily. He didn't even have to do the dishes, I'd do them.

But I held it in. I figured, why not come up with a new solution? So I ask my ex if we could budget in money for a cleaning service, grocery delivery fees and/or a personal shopper. I showed him that we could afford it, but he wasn't having it. He didn't want to pay more than he had to. There was rent, utilities, his own school loans, car loans, insurance payments, etc. He had always had expensive gadgets from mommy and daddy, but god forbid we pay for any one useful service that would take more off my shoulders.

At first, I wanted to scream at him. But then I just broke down and had a full panic attack. *It wasn't easy. Relationships are too fucking hard. If I even found someone else, it would just be pulling teeth every fucking day because people fucking suck. I should just kill myself. I should jump out the window headfirst from our apartment building. I can't do this. I'm fucking dying. I can't breathe. I hate this motherfucker. Why can't it just be easy for once? It's like this with everyone.*

But, of course, it just ended up that I'm the crazy girlfriend that broke up with him over a dirty dish.

But other people can just pick their battles, work out solutions and come together as a team more easily than I can. I'm reigning in this rage-beast inside my mind every time someone just REFUSES to be a tiny bit more considerate."

It happens all the time to the point where I dred having to end hang outs but that's not realistic or fair on them ofc.

I guess it has alot to do with the fact that I'll probably never see them again cuz they might abandon me, they might internally hate me, me not knowing who I am, and so on. Its hard for me to not feel awful after a good day out with people and I hate this instability"

"Advice for BPD, From a BPD person",514,kqf9zf,93,"I've came across a lot of posts in this sub, and I'm so worried to see beautiful souls suffering this way. So Instead of spamming each of your posts, I tried my best to convey my thoughts here in this single post.

First of all, I have signs of Quiet BPD for about a decade, which includes episodes of self-harm and suicide thoughts. Till date, I've kept it as a secret and no one close to me knows that I have an illness. I'm coping and holding it all together with no therapy on my own with some self-care tips I've learnt. (BPD is different from person to person, I hope you find at least one of these points useful.)

&#x200B;

* **Learn to switch between realities:** Please acknowledge that you have instant access to everything that can take you to different worlds, be it video games, hobbies, movies, TV shows or whatever you like, try to immerse yourself in it to detach from your real life now and then. It's temporary but effective enough to stop you from making impulsive decisions.

>*Let me ask you this, who here haven't binge watched series like Game of Thrones or Stranger Things or got immersed in a decision based video game? Where was your BPD then? Think about it ,artists today do great work in bringing  'reality-escaping' content everyday. Discover and make use of them!*

&#x200B;

* **A Reason to Live:** I bet there must be people who will love you unconditionally despite your illness. They can be your parents or anyone. Please spare them the pain by not developing suicidal thoughts. Consider it as a sacrifice you make for them, for all those they made for you.

>*You might claim that your existence is the reason for their pain but look, you never know the pain of someone losing their beloved son or daughter. It's an indescribable pain that's much cruel than BPD.*

&#x200B;

* **Accept the universal balance:** *There's no yin without yang*. While you're busy constantly thinking all the bad things about you, You don't give enough time or chance to realize your self-worth. I bet you have at least one good quality or something positive about you that makes you or others feel better! Try to divert your focus on that for once, and try to feel good about yourself anyways possible.

&#x200B;

* **Create a ""backup"" recovery tool**: In the past, if any small thing calmed you from a BPD episode, **SAVE IT!** It can be a simple quote, an image, a memory, a self-note, video or anything that can be stored and easily accessible anytime. Do not underestimate it. When you feel like you're losing control ever again and don't know what to do, the first thing that should come to your mind is to open your backup recovery that you created.

>*I used to have a backup folder in all my devices named ""Recovery"" containing all the quotes, images and videos that made me feel better at one point. It is the first thing that helps, whenever I feel like collapsing.*

&#x200B;

* **Widen your perspective:** It can be anything that can stop you from thinking about yourself. For instance, you could push yourself to think how it feels to be in the shoes of a close non-BPD person to understand their view. Also, there are lots of external perspectives that are very easy to overlook but can really make your problems look so tiny. There are people in this world, who can't even afford simple things we take for granted. There are people who went through horrible accidents/incidents and still fight to live after facing enormous physical/mental pain. And the list of examples goes on. (While not everyone prefers comparison, I think for some it can make them count their blessings a little)

>*This might seem crazy, but in one of my worst years, I recovered by reading and watching videos about modern science including* [cosmos](https://tesla36.wordpress.com/2019/07/30/the-space-time-saga/)*,* [tiny particles](https://tesla36.wordpress.com/2018/06/10/theory-of-everything/) *and even* [parallel universes](https://tesla36.wordpress.com/2018/07/17/deep-insight-on-the-alternate-versions-of-you/)*. Trust me, it made me realize how insignificant humans are over the mystery of things we can't possibly comprehend.  I ended up writing my own articles sharing the perspectives I learnt.*

&#x200B;

* **The BPD ""superpower"":** If you ever felt bad about yourself for having BPD, you might wanna rethink some factors. You have a pure heart of a child, that's so rare and your love is one of the strongest on the planet. Mostly importantly, the unique feature of BPD is you're either **all in** or **all out**. There's no in-between which I think is absolutely a superpower! (That's even how atoms work on the fundamental level). When you're **all into** something, you have the ability to use your brain potential more than what usual humans are capable of. This obsession can make you achieve great things if channeled on the right path. You can make wonders in the field of your choice, get lost in your own world you fabricated and don't give a damn about society or relationships.

>*Despite the pattern of links between intelligence and mental illness observed in various famous people throughout history, I myself experienced achieving things beyond my imagination with my colleagues calling me a multi-talented personality rather than a person with illness.*

&#x200B;

* **How to ""Feel Good"":** Ok, you know you have a superpower, but not motivated to achieve anything or nothing interests you in specific. Here's the drill. Haven't you ever felt good by helping someone in need? or making someone's day happier? Well if you did, the world actually needs more of it! The more you do it, the more you'll feel better I assure you. Simple act of kindness can transform someone's life. And the satisfaction you get is priceless. While you are not interested in focusing on a specific field, you could divert yourself volunteering to make a difference in others life. It can be anything you will be proud of doing.

>*This idea of a sacrifice, that even if you're not happy, you could live to make others happy is so divine and shows how best of a human being you are!* ***Here's a hug, if you do that and feel unappreciated.*** (personally the *dark knight* series boosted my motivation towards this idea)

&#x200B;

* **Look at you! You're recovering, Right here! :**  One of the best ways to ease the pain is to know that you're not alone. If you're watching movies on BPD or found communities like this sub right here, seeing others going through the same struggle as you, getting comments for your post saying ""that's 100% me"", ""you describe me""... Doesn't it make u feel less 'alien' and eases your soul! Congratulations for reaching out! you made a step towards recovery.

Start understanding and helping each other wherever you can, of all the things you've experienced yourself and see the difference. *A best therapist for a BPD person, is a BPD person!*

&#x200B;

>**You've come this far in fighting what normal people could never handle! Hold on warriors!  :)**

Edit: Thanks for all the love and support. This made my day. Happy it helped some people :)

Update: A Tip from [u/No\_Trick\_7167](https://www.reddit.com/user/No_Trick_7167/) :  *I changed my FP's contact name in my phone to ""Be Your Own FP."" Having that constant reminder (when we are talking or when I go back to our text thread) has helped me so much. I'm really happy with this trick :)*"
this morning i found out my dad is going to live and gets to come home from the hospital tomorrow,513,k4wvc4,30,im sure this will go unnoticed again but i wanted to share
I don’t have BPD,508,j3zcex,87,"I made a post on here a long time ago with the same title, knowing I didn’t have BPD but no one believed me. 
I’ve just been diagnosed with schizophrenia instead, had my other diagnoses removed and I feel both relief and complete terror. Some people said that the diagnosis doesn’t matter, the right help does - but to get the right help, you need the right diagnosis. 
So this is a goodbye to this sub, I sincerely hope that you will all have really great and fulfilling moments in your lives. You’ve been a great help. Lots of love."
How I transformed,511,9mzs0f,65,"



This won’t resonate with everyone.  I’m just posting here what’s worked for me.  Also trigger warning: if you’re not feeling strong, don’t read.

1.   Disconnect from the diagnosis/label.   You are not your BPD.   You are simply a human being that’s doing the best you can.    

2.    As much as you disconnect from the label, become very familiar with the traits that make up a BPD diagnosis.   I made a list of the criteria and then I personalized it by writing down examples of how it played out in my own life.   I kept track over time of how I was doing in each area.

3.    Drugs and alcohol are out.   They just are.    We don’t have the luxury of indulging in this area.   If you’re serious about transformation, be drug and alcohol free.   EDIT:   On reflection, this sounds heavy-handed on my part.    For me, even small amounts of drug or alcohol seem to affect me more than many of my friends.   Even weed can make me feel anxious.    In my real world, I haven’t made this a hard/fast rule.   Part of our struggle is to get away from all or nothing thinking,    What I do know is that I have a tendency to not respond well to any kind of recreational drug or alcohol,   It can set off a downward spiral.    I’ve found that, for me, my life is much better without it.  And these days I’m not trying to escape my reality.  I’m very happy with my reality as it is.

4.    Physical exercise becomes the new drug.   Start with walking.    But commit to doing it everyday.    The step apps see great to keep track of your steps,    Set a minimum number and commit to reaching it everyday.

5.  Nutrition plays a role.    Sugar in particular.   I’ve found being low carb, keto specifically, has helped tremendously.  I’m no longer brain foggy and exhausted all the time.

6.   Relationships.    Ok this is a biggie and the hardest one.    People are not all good or all bad.   Relationships go through ups and downs.    Stop taking what other people say, do or think personally.   It’s not about you.  People have their own shit going on.   They’re not thinking about you.   REFOCUS your attention on yourself.   Discover that YOU have your OWN back!!  For the first time in your life be there for yourself! Be your own savior.    Stop the tapes in your head that tell you that you suck, that you’re too stupid, too fat, too ugly,    Verbally out loud tell that voice to fuck off!     Don’t even attempt to be in a relationship if you’re looking for the other person to “save” you in some way.   OR don’t ever make another person responsible for how YOU feel.   YOU are responsible for how you feel.    People can be assholes.  But so can you and I:   None of us a perfect and never will be.

7.   Spirituality,   Reconnect with your spiritual side.   Whatever feels real to you.    Develop a routine of prayer and meditation.    

8.   Take care of YOU.   Make your bed, pay your bills, make a budget, clean your car, service your car, go to the dentist, have a physical exam.   In short do all the things all adults do to manage their life.   You’re worth it.   These steps sound simple and most people who struggle with BPD symptoms  (me included) gloss over this stuff.  Taking care of the daily tasks is Uber important for us.   It gives us a sense of structure and security,    We have to do this for ourselves.

9.  Never take an immediate action on an emotional response.   You’ll regret it.    Count to 100.    When someone triggers you, breathe it out.   Physical exercise helps a lot with this.   Stop the drama.   Everything with love and compassion.  Slow down your emotionality as much as you can.     REMEMBER no one knows what’s going on inside your head unless you show it.     All of us will probably struggle with intense emotions our whole lives.   But we can manage it!!  Not overreacting is a skill we can learn,

I send all of you love,     None of us asked for this stuff!   None of us deserve it.  But know that you, as a human being, a worth giving yourself a chance to live your best life!     

I believe in you.    I was a complete mess a decade ago.   Hard work and time has made a huge difference in my life.   My life isn’t perfect but I now know what it’s like to be happy,   I have solid relationships, good job and I’m in the best shape of my life.    If I can do it, trust me when I say, anyone can,"
Get off social media,516,ismd35,110,"I deleted my social media accounts with the exception of Reddit and I feel so much better. No more comparing my life to others’ l, no more mindless scrolling, and no more reading negative posts, especially during the time of Covid-19. 

Give it a try - just delete the apps. You might feel better."
"“Hmm, I better get a second opinion on this” *Asks myself the same question in ten minutes when I’m in a different mood*",513,aipx4w,19,"Edit: wow I didn’t expect a single upvote on this, turns out we are all the saaAaAme"
After an almost 2 year mental health break I just finished my first 8 hour shift,509,lo107g,27,"After a series of psychotic episodes in early through mid 2019 I quit my job to focus on getting better. A month ago I finally got a new job and I just worked my first 8 hour shift tonight. My feet hurt and I’m exhausted, but it doesn’t feel overwhelming, I feel in control. More than anything I feel a huge sense of pride, I’m learning to stop setting limits on what I think I can do. 

Most importantly I’m learning my bpd doesn’t have to ruin my life, I’m the one calling the shots.

Does anyone else feel a sense of emptiness/abandonment when a conversation ends?,507,l0ytj7,50,"Sometimes I'm just casually talking to a family member or acquaintance, then when the conversation reaches its natural end and they leave the room, I'll get this sudden feeling of abandonment. Or a friend tells me bye at the end of a day in class and I feel oddly alone after they walk away. Especially if in either case, they go off to talk to someone else.

It's just a bit dramatic lol, I mean, it's just the end of a conversation, I have to laugh at my own feelings. And most of the time I shake it off pretty easily, and it doesn't happen every time of course, but it happens often enough that I've noticed it."
How the fuck do I figure out if I'm the toxic one in the relationship or if I'm just being treated unfairly?,509,dktvds,61,"It's driving me fucking crazy, are my needs and demands irrational and overbearing? Am I overly sensitive and bitchy about things that don't or shouldn't matter? Am I expecting too much and miserable and self-sabotaging? Or is it them? Are they toxic, heartless narcs who provoke and trigger me? Are they abusive and manipulative, just fucking with my head until I lose my shit? 

Have I always been the abusive one? Do I let myself get taken advantage of? Do I manipulate other people or do they just not understand my pain? Do I provoke anger or are they just incapable of dealing with me?

What is the fucking truth. I hate relationships so fucking much, and even more how much I need to be in one. I don't know anything. I will never know how to handle this disorder. I will never know how to love someone or how they should love me, and be able to trust that we are okay. Im just so angry right now. I don't know anything. 




Edit: thank you for the awards, it always helps knowing there are so many people that can relate or are looking for the same answers. Grateful for this community."
I got into Columbia.,511,9kt9uo,56,After years of abuse and dropping out of school I just heard I was accepted into Columbia at the age of 26. I am stunned. 
how to find a new hobby as someone with BPD: a guide,510,801s4z,58,"step 1: see a cool video of someone doing something on the internet. for example, playing the harp.

step 2: realize that this is your purpose in life. this is what you were put on the world to do. holy fuck you’re going to be the best harp player in the whole world. you’re going to be famous. you’re going to win america’s got talent. holy shit.

step 3: order whatever you need to get into this hobby, like a very expensive harp.

step 4: when the stuff comes in the mail, start dicking around with it. hey, if i hit this string it makes a funny noise!

step 5: get super into it for a few days. you’re doing it, man. it only took you a week to learn how to play twinkle twinkle little star. you’re like some kind of prodigy.

step 6: get bored and slowly abandon hobby. whatever. harps aren’t even that cool.

step 7: see new cool video of someone doing something online. holy fuck, you never realized how cool skateboards were! you’re going to be the next tony hawk. hell yeah.

step 8: repeat steps 2-7, until your house is filled with paraphernalia from various hobbies you’ve abandoned as soon as they stopped being instantly gratifying. wonder if you’re a hoarder. hey, maybe you can get on that tv show about hoarders! holy shit, you’re going to be the best hoarder ever. "
DAE notice that they have trained themselves to switch from overly sensitive to completely uncaring?,512,fsdsjs,33,"I thought that over the years I had developed some special sort of confidence because I had finally learned to “toughen up” like my Dad always said. I used to be so scared of people’s opinions and thoughts and feelings lest they be negative towards me, and now I tell myself I don’t give a FUCK, everyone is stupid, bla bla bla. Is this a manifestation of BPD, or am I just a jaded bitch? I tend to be way more of a pushed away than a clingy type."
"My psychiatrist said the ""R"" word today...",510,aggejq,70,"""You are in **remission** of your borderline symptoms."" 

We acknowledged that I still struggle with thoughts that have ""characteristics of borderline."" I will still continue therapy and the consistent use of skills. Overall though... I did it. I'm doing it. I am taking my life back from this horrible illness that caused an extreme amount of hurt and pain.

And guess what? You can fucking do it too, so keep working hard my friend."
DAE have a lot of trouble letting go and forgiving yourself for past mistakes/bad decisions?,509,lxku6m,40,"I have made so much progress with myself over the past two years. Stopped drinking, regular therapy, medication, the whole nine.  I've put in the work in and I know I should be proud and forgive myself. But I just can't seem to do it.  I keep reliving my shitty mistakes and bad decisions, and I don't know how to stop feeling so guilty.

I got in TWO drunk driving accidents. Totaled one car and fucked the other one up pretty bad. Both times I got away unharmed and without a DUI. Nothing on my record. I don't understand how or why I was spared but even those two incidents didn't stop me from continuing to drink. I got off so lucky, so much luckier than so many millions of people. I am a white girl, and I know my privilege is mostly what spared me, and I feel awful for not recognizing it and changing my ways sooner.

I've been an absolute nightmare to my past boyfriends and I can't let go of how toxic I was because I didn't take care of my mental health. I constantly relive the last toxic and horrible fight that I had with my ex before I completely cut them out of my life. I can't seem to forget the abhorrent things I said and threatened them with. I have lost people in my life, and I know I've hurt them a lot. I keep thinking about how they hate me and how they still talk shit about how much of a shitty person I am to their family. I've hurt my own family many times.

My drinking caused my mother and my sister so much pain, and I don't know how much they still think about how much of an unstable mess I was. I don't even talk to my step-sister, but that's a different story(had to draw a boundary because we are just fundamentally different people and will never have a healthy relationship, and I know myself well enough now to stay away from her energy. It's not personal, it's just a boundary I need to set.)I feel like my family is still scared that I'll just lose it gain and fall off the wagon, even though I have absolutely no urge to ever let myself get so low again.

Like, I'll be driving and suddenly my brain just gets flooded with the guilt and reliving of these shitty memories(and so many more) and it absolutely destroys me emotionally for a while. It feels so unbelievably heavy, almost as if the events just happened all over again. Like, my brain won't let me move on and the feelings of guilt and remorse just come in waves of debilitating emotion. It's painful. Such a unique, intense pain that I don't know if anyone else feels it. I don't think any of my family/friends can comprehend the concept, but It definitely seems BPD-related.

Sorry this is so long, I just don't have anyone else to talk to about this. If anyone has ever felt these feelings, just knowing that will help me feel validated and not crazy. thanks

&#x200B;

\*Edit\*: I was not expecting so much feedback! Thank you all so much for not only relating but for being so empathetic and understanding. I love you guys so much. Thank you for the kind words of inspiration and for being some of the only cheerleaders in this facet of my life. xoxo ps thanks for the awards!!!"
Yesterday I decided to use my platform to speak up and raise awareness for BPD and someone threw it back in my face.,510,heykp5,124,"Yeaterday, as the title says - I decided to speak up about my bpd diagnosis. I posted a picture online and tagged it with #bpdawareness. This took a lot of courage. I never get personal online but I decided I want to do this, if it helps 1 person then I have accomplished what I’m setting out to do. 

So anyway, roughly 20 minutes later, an old school friend (who was my best friend for 9 years, we never fell out, simply drifted. We stay in contact and whenever she posts anything sad, I always message her to make sure she is ok, I thought it was a very nice, wholesome relationship we had). 

She posted on her story, ‘if you’re going to self diagnose or pretend to have a mental health condition to get a few extra likes on ya pic and hashtag it like you’re ‘cool’ please unfollow me and never, ever communicate with me again. You’re a cunt’ 

So obviously, I instantly put 2 and 2 together and sent her a message. They fact I felt like I had to send her my ( EXTREMELY PERSONAL) diagnosis letter from the NHS to prove that I do Infact, struggle with BPD, is frankly disgusting. I cried for hours and obviously I know it’s petty, and her opinion shouldn’t matter but it really hurt. 

I just wanted to share this experience, this is why I feel the need to debunk the stigma. The fact that people appear ok online DOESNT mean that they are OK! 

anyway, am I overreacting? It’s hard to tell some time’s? 

She said it was about a friend, but it definitely wasn’t because she unfollowed me...  idk :( felt sad."
"Oh, so we're not soulmates, it was just the BPD",509,gazy08,72,"It took me a lot to find the clarity I needed. It took me a lot to understand that this was the illness, not the reality.

At the beginning of the year I met a man. We were so rapidly falling in love, spending so much time together, he really seemed as obsessed with me as I was to him. I fell extremely hard, as you can imagine. Everything was perfect and beyond. But after just a month, he told me he needed some time alone to work on himself. 

So there I was. Begging him not to leave. Begging a man that I've had in my life for a month and realistically speaking, barely knew, not to leave me. Crying hysterically next to him. Not being able to adjust my emotions to the reality. 

What happened next was spending my days crying, screaming and cutting myself for a whole month. Alone. Literally screaming and crying my heart out. For hours every night. Also I've made my worst scars ever. 

Over a person that's been in my life for a month. A fucking month. 

And to this day, I literally feel like I've developed PTSD-like symptoms about that whole situation.

So whose fault is it? Is it mine? Is it the illness' fault? Who is there to blame? Oh. No one.

It's so crazy how BPD twists up your emotions. And how long it took me to realize that this was indeed because of the BPD, and not because me and that man were soulmates.



EDIT: Thank you so much for the support! All your stories and advices really made me feel so much better and so understood. This is indeed an amazing community. Wish you all the best on your journey!"
A gentle reminder that BPD can also be a blessing,510,a7494w,102,"Yesterday I went to a performance of Handel's Messiah. Multiple times during the performance it took every ounce of control I had not to just start sobbing because it was just so fucking beautiful and I was so full of joy I thought I might fly apart. 

Often we struggle with painful and negative emotional extremes. But we can also feel happiness to a degree that would take a lot of drugs for most people. 

Wishing you all some beauty and joy. "
DAE repeat what they just said/typed over and over in their head?,511,k39yv5,79,"I have no idea if this is from my bpd, my adhd, or my social anxiety but whenever I reply to someone (could be replying to a tweet, verbally, or texting) I have to repeat my reply over and over in my head or go back and reread it 100 times even after it’s already been sent and I honestly don’t know why!! Sometimes Ill read what I typed and I’ll be like “ok that was a good reply” but I’ll still keep reading it or saying it in my head. It normally only happens with people I don’t speak to often but it could honestly be any interaction with anyone. I really hope I’m not alone in this lol"
"ever feel incomplete without a romantic partner, only to feel bored & annoyed once you have one?",507,jsnw70,79,"every time i meet someone new it’s like a daydream until it isn’t, and i just pick them apart, hyper-analyze them, & then resent them for insignificant things. i know i’m projecting my own insecurities, but it doesn’t stop the resentment/repulsion. i like the person i’m with & i don’t want this recurring habit to
ruin it. thoughts?"
I took care of myself today,509,j2dv3g,34,"I went to the dentist for the first time in years and I have a cavity. I still went. I hated it but I went. I washed my face twice today and brushed my teeth twice. I changed my clothes. I took my meds. Ate properly. I took care of myself today for the first time in a very long time. Is this basic care that most people do without thinking about it? Sure. Will I do this everyday? Realistically, no. But yesterday I really didn’t care to breathe, let alone get out of bed so this kind of stuff is a really big deal to me. Everyday is a victory in a way and I’m figuring it out. Progress isn’t linear but I’m celebrating my wins and today was a victory. 

Sometimes bpd, depression, anxiety, and my ED just all leave me feeling like I’m not capable of caring for myself and that I also don’t deserve it. I’m deciding to be better.

EDIT: I posted this and went to bed and woke up to all of this support and love and I’m genuinely in tears right now... all of you are so amazing and is this community has done so much to encourage and support me and words can’t describe how grateful I am to all of you that have interacted with this post. There are so many loving, amazing human beings in this sub and I just hope that you all know that you’ve made a difference in my life. I’m sending so much love to everyone ❤️"
"DAE notice their voice, accent and handwriting change depending on their mood?",511,lrci4b,61,"wtf is up with that?

i understand the concept of convergence - when you unconsciously change your speech to mirror the person you're speaking to - and as someone with no fixed identity, i do this a lot. but i've spent the past year at home with just my partner and i hear myself at times sounding really posh, at other times speaking with a thick essex accent, at other times picking up element of my partner's geordie accent, and at times speaking with a strange, americanised international school accent and i think it's somehow mood related. it's like, who am i trying to be? it freaks me out a little bit and i'm wondering if there's an explanation. i've moved a lot between england, scotland and germany, always ending up in a very international crowd, and i think this jumble of influences definitely confuses my accent more.

my handwriting also changes according to my mood - i can look at some notes i've made and know what mood i was in when i wrote them bc my ""sad handwriting"" is so noticeably different to my ""excited handwriting"" or ""anxious handwriting"". is this a quirk of having no fixed sense of self or am i in fact completely normal?"
Why do I fall in love with everyone that shows even the slightest interest in me?,504,m7wuh9,103,"It just happened at work. A customer showed up with a dog, we had a chat about his dog and about my volunteer work fostering kittens. And he said he'd see me again soon. Asked me if I was working here every day. Not gonna lie, he was cute, but I realized after he left that I wouldn't have given him a second thought if he hadn't shown interest. Now he has left and I'm repeating our conversation in my head, thinking I should have given him my number or social media. Wishing he comes back. WHY?!

This happens every time, and I wonder if other BPD people experience the same. As soon as someone shows interest in me, I can't stop thinking about them and imagine a whole future together, while in reality I know they're not my type, or that I'm not really interested. I get so tired of these rollercoasters.."
Identity disturbance is really one of the hardest traits of BPD for me.,506,k9cooj,59,"I feel like I have no self.

If I'm in a relationship with someone, I start to shapeshift into them in a desperate attempt to share the same interest so that we can be ''soulmates''. And if I'm around certain group of people, I start to talk, act and dress like them so that I can feel like I belong.

If we're discussing something, I may say A, and then B... then A again... then 5 minutes after it's C. My opinions are not consistent. 

I get bored with everything quickly. Nothing seems to interest me for too long.

I just want to be part of something... of someone. And this may sound fucked up but I was really glad I finally got diagnosed with BPD. It was one of the few times I felt like I belonged somewhere.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support and kind comments!"
Does anyone else find themselves being much more stable when they do not have a FP?,507,g61u5j,120,"TDLR; I take better care of myself when I don’t have a favorite person. Anyone else?

I (F23) have rarely been single in my life. I’ve had 5 relationships, and when single, usually crushing/obsessed with somebody. I almost always have a favorite person, but I have been without one for a couple months, and my life has improved drastically. I mean, there’s a lot of factors—I went to the mental hospital, started new meds, and when I got home, started exercising, got on a schedule, and eating much healthier. It’s like when I’m not sending all my love into someone else, I have the energy to put it towards myself. 

Something similar happened after my 4 year relationship ended, and I was without a favorite person then too. This makes me sad, because I think that I can never have boundaries, or be in love with someone without losing myself in them. 

Does anyone else feel this way or experienced something similar?"
DAE feel like you love to make people fall in love with you?,506,fzwrh9,112,"It happens to me most of the time I love to make people fall for me and when they’re really do, I dump them and don’t wanna deal with their feelings towards me. But when they ignore me I start panicking and doing anything to make them fall for me again.


Edit: I don’t mean to brag about it, and I really feel like a horrible person when I’m doing this. I don’t know it just happened, like I really love to feel wanted and desired by others. I’m not a super model or anything, but I do think that the way I treated them and the way I talked to them kinda lure them into my “trap” by manipulating their feelings. If you think this ability to make people fall for you is cool, I don’t know what to say. Sometimes it feels good knowing that you’re wanted, and sometimes you’re confused because you don’t know what you want. You want them but you don’t want them in a certain way.

Edit 2: I’m aware that what I’m doing is not right. And I’m working on it. I really working on it. That’s why I never drag the person to have a committed relationship with me when I’m still confused. Maybe the way I’m saying on this post sounds dramatic and make y’all think that I don’t feel sorry and seems proud about what I’ve done. I’ve tried to warn them how awful it can be if I pushed myself into a committed relationship with them and how toxic I can be but they just say that they wanna try and I’m not what I’m thinking."
A few points I think can be soothing for those with BPD,500,k9okop,48,"Hi 19F diagnosed with BPD for three years.
I am no where near full recovery but have been non stop educating myself on my illness to help myself better cope and understand why I exhibit certain behaviors or why they happen. And here are a few things I've learned along the way to help validate you and not make you feel like a rageful, manipulative, co dependent monster like a lot of the medical field makes us feel lol.

-Splitting is a result of being CONDITIONALLY loved as a child, ie: being hyper praised for doing a good thing but belittled as soon as you displayed a ""non acceptable behavior"" it also can be a result of a non consistent feeling of protection from a core guardian in your childhood. So: you aren't a bad person for thinking the people in your life are out to get you and bad people, you are just a product of your environment and grew up thinking people were either safe, or unsafe and no in between. But every single human has good and bad traits, just as you do too! And that is totally normal and okay.

- You aren't a narcissist, nor do you have NPD. NPD and BPD are in the same class of personality disorders because SOME symptoms overlap. Like rage, deep insecurity and hyper defensive behavior. If you hear the word Narcissist or Narcissism a lot when researching BPD, they do correlate but people with untreated NPD would not have empathy or be aware they are a Narcissist. They have no reguard for their actions and don't usually care to get proper help. (not all just most, if u have npd and got help- im so proud) also its near impossible to have BOTH NPD and BPD. 

- 78% to 98% of people with BPD do go into remission and recover!

- You aren't faking your diagnosis just because you don't line up with the textbook symptoms. There are different kinds of borderline and ""pure borderline"" (which is what the classic textbook symptoms are) is only between 3% and 7% of people with bpd. and pure bpd means JUST this pd. no other diagnosis. the majority of people experience complex bpd, which is the borderline but with other diagnosis like depression, bipolar, ocd etc.. and it often shows the thought process involved in bpd is the same, but the emotional reaction is very different! Everyone experiences this illness differently, yet we can all relate on broad topics! 

- You aren't a burden. Often times bc of the illness we suffer from percieving every emotion as negative. There are positive, neutral and negative emotions displayed in humans and since people with bpd are hypersensitive to their surroundings bc of a negative or abusive environment- things tend to always seem more negative. You may think the cashier is giving you a dirty look, but its really important to Reassess before emotionally reacting (rage fit, crying, panic attack, dissosiation) because logically the cashier probably has something in their eye or was squinting to see something near or behind you! Stop and breathe before reacting, even when its not as comforting as lashing out or crying. Because the fallout of the situation will be much less when you act logically/wise- minded rather than emotionally."
"My irrational brain while having BPD in a relationship - If you are not actively loving me, then that must mean that you hate me",503,ia5g47,62,"Or at the very least it means that I did something wrong and you’re now thinking about leaving me.  

Anybody else feel this way too?  Please tell me I’m not alone with this."
It is disgusting how little people know about mental health.,497,k9vcm8,49,"The lack of education leads to so many people feeling unheard and worthless. I don’t know how many times I have had to explain until I was practically in tears that my mental illness is not just me being emotional or how meditation, oddly enough, is not a cure-all.

I just started talking to an old guy friend. We were speaking about why we never dated and i said it was for the good because i was undiagnosed back then and very unstable. He laughed about it and said he could have supported me and basically fixed me. I told him no, that he couldn’t have and it started this thing where he was saying he has this “energy” and that i just let my emotions control me and i need to meditate . i told him i have and i hated it and he said i didn’t do it properly. I went on to say that nobody can get rid of my mental disorder and even therapy won’t cure it, but help me control it and he just wasn’t having it. He kept insisting he would change me and make me all better and then proceeded to say “You haven’t studied that thing you have properly.” 

THIS IS SO DAMAGING AND DISGUSTING."

I caught myself splitting last night!,503,dctwt0,45,"So I beat my friends to their apartment last night after we all left the bar from celebrating said friends' birthday. I waited a few minutes in my car (first time visiting the new place, didnt know which apartment was theirs') and then called them twice. They didnt answer. I waited another 5 minutes and immediately started splitting. Without doing my own research on BPD and the symptoms, I never wouldve been able to catch this. One thing would have led to another and I probably wouldve just gone home angrily thinking that they ditched me.

I suddenly realized that I was demonizing my friend in my head (devaluing, but I'm a fan of evil shit 😈) and getting worked up. I immediately split him into the category of toxic person, which makes me want to run and hide. I noticed this, and kept calm. I acknowledged my emotions and let myself feel them, but also told myself that they were uncalled for and that i just needed to be patient.

Lo and behold they were in a dead zone and called me back. All this splitting happened in just a few minutes, but I disassociate into my own brain too hard sometimes and it felt like forever.

I'm so proud of myself for checking my rollercoaster brain for what feels like the first time! :)"
I feel almost scared to tell people in my life when they’ve hurt my feelings because I don’t know if it’s my BPD or if I’m being treated badly and should put my foot down,500,bmwac9,34,How can I cope with this? I hate it so much. It’s like I feel ashamed to have normal ass human emotions. I always feel like I’m being too sensitive or overreacting because that’s what my family always told me growing up. It’s really hard for me to know if I’m being emotionally abused or manipulated because I’m scared to speak up about shit in fear of looking “crazy”.
I made it through a full weekend (Fri and Sat night) without alcohol,504,l481j6,31,"I have long used alcohol as a crutch. For times of chronic emptiness and numbness, alcohol helps elicit an emotional response from me. For times where anxiety becomes overbearing and uncontrollable, it helps calm me down and wash away those feelings. 

For these reasons, I don’t really know how to stop. 1 drink turns into 4, 4 turns into 8, and before I know it I am incoherent. Sometimes it turns scary for my roommates and friends, and they have to wonder if they will need to restrain me so that I do not hurt myself or take my life. 

Weight gain from binging, feeling foggy in the days after I binge, general unproductivity in my day-to-day and wasteful expenditures added to the implication above became too much. I decided to take a 30-day break to figure out what needs to be done this year to get me on a better track. Making it one weekend as a college student is a big win for me. It was inexplicably hard, but I kept thinking of the future consequences of my actions.

I’m already getting closer towards a promotion that will put me well ahead of my peers. Now I just need to figure out how I can get school completed as fast as possible, get healthy and in shape again, and learn how to build meaningful relationships without alcohol. It won’t be easy, but 2021 *has* to be my year.

I was painfully shy as a child, “too quiet”, “too shy”, “too reserved”, “too sensitive”. I was always hyper aware and fearful of people’s judgments. To the point I tried to not take up space, tried to be invisible, felt like I was a burden. 
If I’m around people who knew me like that - mainly my family - if they are discouraging especially, it can cause me to regress into people pleasing and trying to be invisible again. 
I freeze and fawn when in danger, go totally blank when I’m put on the spot.
I’ve never felt like I fit in.

Yet, I’ve never wanted to be like everyone else, style or looks, or whatever - I have always been unique in style of clothes etc.

“High Functioning” BPD isn’t real and I’m slowly dying.,496,lt9ps6,54,"*Possible TW: self harm mentioned*

I have struggled with BPD traits my whole life, without even knowing it. In my late teens the depression and anxiety really got bad, and I secretly (without help from my parents or anyone) sought help in the form of therapy and medication. I wound my way through my 20s through more lows than highs, lots of different meds, and lots of therapy. BUT.... the catch is that I have always been very “under the radar”. 

I think sometimes a sense of pride-or simply a belief that you are “less sick” -goes along with being “high functioning BPD”........but all it actually means is that you keep pushing through no matter what the secret cost (self harm, unhealthy coping mechanisms at home, loneliness) but get NO SUPPORT. 

You don’t get the intensive therapy and help that you crave and NEED so desperately when you graduate HS and Uni with highest honours and then immediately start working a full time career as a registered nurse, bubbly and hyper-competent at work to boot. You get nothing because no one knows you are sick. And you keep going and going because there’s this internal NEED to keep performing, to be “a good girl”....even though inside you are toxic, resentful, sad, self-harming, self-LOATHING.

Can anyone else relate? I’m 31(f) now and everything is together on the outside (own a home, car, have the career etc) but I feel like a fraud and more than anything else....I am DYING for someone to care for me. I’m dying for someone to notice. I’m dying for someone to help me because my Favourite Person (my boyfriend 36(m)) is a narcissistic alcoholic and he’s NEVER going to be that person. He’s depleted my finances. He makes and breaks promises more times than I can count. But everything is my fault. I’m toxic for my reactions. He watches me self harm and mocks me. 

Help help help. I don’t want to be high functioning anymore. I want to be in a psych bed with someone helping me. I don’t want the blades right here for me to use to get through another argument. I need help. Please. Please ."

Just now I realised he'd left me on read 8 minuted ago and the message I sent would be one you'd expect a reply to. However, I am not letting that trigger send me into a flurry of anxiety and rage. I've calmed myself down after experiencing the initial rush of emotion and am now using the wise mind technique. He said earlier to me that he was helping his gandfather with a job so I think it is likely he just didn't have time to reply or got distracted, I do that myself sometimes. It does not mean he doesn't like me and it does not mean he's going to cancel our date tomorrow. 

Oh wow! 

While I was typing this, up pops a notification that he's replied. See, there was no need to panic in the first place. He sent me a lovely message in return and even put a kiss at the end I am very happy. I am so so proud of myself for not spiralling. Hopefully this can axt as a reminder for those of you who need to remember acting with rage and emotion will not make anything better. The situation is better handled by calming yourself down and thinking with your wise mind."
BPD Affirmations :),494,l3wdsu,43,"-You are not gonna get upset over little things anymore. You are going to remind yourself that they are too miniscule to even bother you. You are mature enough.



-You are not gonna obsessively wait for a text or a call from someone. You are talented, smart and have other things to occupy your mind with. You are going to be in control of your reactions.



-No one is ignoring you. Remember that one time you were so invested in something that you didn't feel like replying to a person immediately? Exactly. People have things to do. They have lives. It's okay even if it seems like you are not their first priority. You have to accept it and make yourself your own priority. Acceptance is the first step.



-You are not gonna beat yourself up for things you've done or said that you feel might've been embarrassing. People make mistakes all the time. Replace that feeling of shame and embarrassment with the feeling of reward or achievement when you successfully avoid making the same mistake again.



-Everytime you react in a healthy way in a friendship, or a relationship instead of overreacting, it will feel a lot more rewarding and positive than it does to people without BPD. That's an advantage. Because to them, that's just the normal way to react, right? But to you, you've overcome a lot of negative feelings to finally do the right thing. You are way stronger and are a fighter, basically."

Does anyone else shift between wanting friends but also wanting to be completely alone?,491,lzcjad,25,"Okay so i have no clue how reddit works i hate social media and only posting this here because i can't think of anywhere else so forgive me if some things are worded badly or something 

Background:

I'm self diagnosed with bpd (too scared to talk to my parents about it sorry i plan on fixing that someday) and never knew about it until a couple of years ago when my best friend(former FP who i haven't spoken to in 2 years i miss them) suggested it due to them knowing me for years and seeing all of my unstable behaviors and emotions with friendships in the past and i did research into it on my own and it made me realize i've been dealing with this since i was a kid as even when i was a child i had unstable relationships with everyone (for years I thought having zero tolerance for people and ending it the moment they annoyed me was normal but turns out it's not)

fast forward now and i'd say I somewhat handle things better and don't have FPs anymore(or at least I like to tell myself) as my last FP I had ghosted me and I got tired of the nonsense that came with relying on other people to feel happy so I decided I'll just seek emotional attachment in other things that aren't people(we made up thankfully but we don't talk anymore and i still don't feel truly happy)

The problem now is that I struggle between deciding if I want friends or if i want to be completely alone

One part of me wants to be completely alone all by myself so i don't have to worry about people and their annoying crap and how exhausting they are, while the other part of me wants to try to make new friends to try to build a strong network of support.   
In simple terms, part of me wants friends, another part of me wants no friends. I even did an experiment a few months ago where i went 3 days without talking to anyone at all(yeah such a long time totally) and i honestly kinda felt fine

I still randomly get annoyed at friends for no real reason and suddenly stopped talking to one and the one that i do talk to daily i feel like it's more because i need to(their working on something for me that I need) then it is because i want to be their friend and I don't want to consider this FP or anything like that because i don't feel anxiety or worry of being abandoned like I did, i just feel more tired of people and annoyed more than anything else 

I try making new friends but that never gets anywhere, in my 3 years of trying I only befriend one person I knew for a year that i considered close and they became my fp until things got sour and they ghosted me

any other attempt at making friends ends in flames or boredom/loss of interest and now i just stick with some of the former ones I've known for years that forgave me for my past actions(others, aren't so much sadly)

it feels like i don't even view friendships normally and that I have more of a tolerance for people then i do actually liking people and that's bad i know but still

my friend i talk to daily says it sounds like as a whole i just need some time alone and a break from people but says there could also be other factors

TLDR: No FPs but still struggle with friendships as a whole and constantly shift between wanting friends and wanting to be completely all alone and even think about the idea of removing everyone i know and disappearing off the face of the earth"

This example is literally just from today and I think it sums up my experience with BPD pretty accurately. 

Today, my FP (also my S/O) went to work. He texted me after and told me he made a work friend that he found out he knew from a high school club (they competed against each other apparently). He shared this info with me to bring up one of those “small worlds” moments, but I couldn’t help but wonder if it was a girl, if they flirted with him, etc. I thought, what if he starts to like this person, thinks they’re better than me and leaves me?
I rationalized these thoughts quickly but I’m not proud that I even had them in the first place. 

Then he told me he was gonna start his drive home. Sometimes he’ll call me on his drive and tell me about his day. He didn’t today, so I asked if he wanted to, and if he didn’t feel like it, it’s okay. (I always make sure to do this, I do not want him to feel obligated to talk to me). He didn’t answer because he was DRIVING. Rationally I know that’s why. But my brain is mean, and a bad thought I had was that he was sick of me, probably saw my text before he started his drive, and ignored it because he thought I was being clingy and annoying. I thought, maybe he’s thinking about that person he knew from work and doesn’t want to talk to me and ruin it. He clearly hates me because he didn’t respond.

I RATIONALLY know none of this is true, but the thing with BPD is, you can objectively know one thing, but feel the emotions of another, and not be able to stop it. It’s like you see yourself about to crash but there’s nothing you can really do to stop it from happening. 

Then, he gets home, sends me a snapchat of his cat, and he hasn’t responded to my text. Rationally, I know he probably walked in, saw his cat, started to pet her, and thought, oh, my girlfriend would like to see this, sent me a video, thats it. 

But my mind was convincing myself that he is ignoring me because he thinks i’m annoying and is trying to prove to me that he doesn’t care about my texts by letting me know he’s active on other social media. I figured he was afraid to say no to calling me on his drive because he knows i’m sensitive and I’ll be very sad if he rejected me in any way, so he doesn’t want to deal with me being emotional and burdening him. I started to feel like a massive nuisance. So I texted him and told him he can say no to me when I ask to call if he wants to. 

Poor guy just calmly explained to me that he didn’t see my texts because he was driving, then came home, saw the cat, pet her. It was that simple. It was that simple for him, and for me I went on a whirlwind of intense emotions where I thought he hated me, was going to leave me for somebody else, that he was purposely ignoring me, that I was an emotional burden and he’d be better off without me. 

And it’s only noon. lol"
Why do we never talk about the ENERGY when “happy”?,492,kte3kr,97,"talking 100 miles an hour, doing a stupid dance every now and then and just annoying my partner non stop. I feel like we never talk about this part of BPD because we are meant to be grateful for the break from depression, which don’t get me wrong I am, but it honestly tires me out. Does anyone else get like this? Like I know I’m acting like an absolute crazy person but I just can’t stop

Edit: I do know that this is the manic part of BPD I’ve been diagnosed for four years now. I just wondered why we never speak to each other on here about the energy only the lows :)"
Does anyone else hold resentment towards their parents and other people who failed you growing up?,487,hb14r3,84,"So growing up I was a pretty shy kid. Up until age 7-8? I didn’t really speak to anyone but my family. I had no friends in kindergarten, and barely any in school. I was practicly invisible. And looking back, I get really pissed off, because the adults who were supposed to look after me, pretty much ignored me. I was left unattended most of the day, without really being interacted with or trying to be included. I think they just shrugged it off as me being shy, but considering how long it went on, and how quiet I was, it shouldn’t have been ignored. 

My parents didn’t really interact much with me as I can recall at least. They were busy dealing with my (older) rebelious sister. But I didn’t really know how to make friends, and I didn’t really seem happy. And I just think it’s strange how they just let everything go ignored. And now I’m 18 and I still barely have friends because I was never taught social skills, and most of the time I’m shy as heck. 

So in conclusion, my question is: does anyone else feel resentment towards your parents/caretakers and maybe others for not helping you or recognising your problems? Like if I got help as a kid, it wouldn’t have ended up this bad?

This illness is so painful,485,k8zpqa,59,"This post is essentially reiterating what all you guys have said, but here goes again.

BPD is SHIT:

- One minute I am fine the next I am having a panic attack or suicidal
- Every day feels like intense grief for the person I could have been looking forward at life as a child , for the years I have lost, the relationships that have been destroyed, the vast chasm between my peers’ experience of life and mine, the life I wanted
- Depression lock-ins where I don’t leave the house for 2 weeks straight
- My body starting to falter due to my constant mood swings
- Wanting to be a potter one minute and a lawyer the next
- The constantly shifting sands of my identity, and my the continuum of my present experience drowning in between them
-Ambient anxiety superimposed on suicidal depression
- Constant, intense shame about who I am and the things I have done when manic or angry
- Questioning whether my feelings are reasonable or appropriate - essentially gaslighting myself 
- The repressed trauma and shame of being taken advantage of when hypersexual and abusing alcohol/drugs
-Dissociation
- Finding relationships too painful, so isolating and yet constantly craving affection and connection 
- Knowing that if I get close to someone it will end in pain on both sides
- Lying to myself and others out of intense fear of rejection 
- Body image problems as a manifestation of self-hatred
- Panic attacks
Being unable to get anything done or stick with anything, because I’m a new person within the same day and mood swings interrupt any semblance of inertia or ‘flow’
- Bulimia
- Self-sabotage
- Arrested development - feeling like I got stuck in adolescence 
- Being volley-balled from one therapist to the next
- Not knowing adulthood without psychiatric drugs 
- Social anxiety and avoidance to the point that leaving the house is hard 
-Narcissism in that even when grocery shopping, I have to dress up and feel like everyone is looking at me
- Hating myself for the narcissism 
- Being imprisoned in my own mind
- Medical bills without the employment to back it up 
- Numbing with alcohol and drugs and that creating its own problems
- Suicidal thoughts every damned day

BPD seems to be a catch-all of frigging everything - anxiety, depression, bipolar, EDs,  CPTSD, codependency, addiction, ADHD, social phobia, OCD, autoimmune problems, endocrinological problems.

I’m straight up not having a good time. 

And people think we’re dramatic or exaggerating.

A few months ago my 8 y/o SD asked me why I take medicine (I have a nightly alarm on my cell so I never forget). She’s a smart kid so decided to give her an abbreviated version of the truth. I explained that sometimes worry or get sad for no reason because my brain doesn’t make all the right stuff, so I take medication to help me be happy. I’ve been pretty down lately & yesterday was really rough. I was trying to keep it from her so I went upstairs to cry but she heard me & followed me up. I was in bed & she stood there, looking so sad. I told her to climb in & asked if she remembered talking about why I take meds, bc I worry & sometimes get sad. I told her I take my meds but they don’t always work and it’s like my brain forgets how to be happy for a little while, but it will be ok soon. She said she understood, told me to think happy thoughts & asked if I wanted to cuddle in the couch & watched a movie. So we watched Nemo. And every time I sniffled she said ”think happy thoughts” and snuggled a little closer. I don’t know what I did to deserve her. I said as much and she said “you love me, you take care of me & you married Daddy” 😍"
"BPD & Netflix: I am more addicted to finding and saving new shows/movies that I'd LIKE TO watch on Netflix, rather than ACTUALLY biting the bullet and watching them...",484,i9dh6e,66,"My BPD means I have an EXTREME sensitivity to how I interpret rejection and disappointment. Because of this, I have a very difficult time starting a new series or movie on Netflix, and tend to watch what's familiar, because I'm afraid of investing time and energy into a show and feel the burn and disappointment when it turns out to be something I don't enjoy.... then sometimes this triggers into a disproportionate response and spiral of other life choices that haven't worked out for my benefit... and then it's a slippery slope of emotions from there. 

I am more addicted to finding and saving new shows/movies that I'd LIKE TO watch on Netflix, rather than ACTUALLY biting the bullet and watching them...

I feel anxious not knowing what great titles are out there that are flying under my radar because of my search algorithm and it gives me a fear of missing out / anxiety...

So I keep on searching, and re-searching, and watching previews, and trailers, and adding to my watch list.... and it gives me a sense of comfort of knowing that I have a collection of about 3 months worth of content that I can watch whenever I want.... SHOULD I ever be ready to watch it. 

But... I. FREAKING. NEVER. DO. 

Then, I'll end up watching re-runs of The Office, Parks, King of Queens, or Jim Gaffigan stand up. Because they're predictable, familiar, and I know they won't betray me...

Anybody else relate?

This actually sounds like an analogy for dating or lots of other things in life with BPD... but for the sake of the post, it's literally about Netflix, lol.

Edit: And as another user commented, another huge element in this is the fact that I can also never seem to watch the last season/episode of a show because I can't bear to see a show that I've become so invested and attached to end.... leaving me and giving me an extreme sense of abandonment and fear of some kind of internal turmoil of how another similar show might not be good enough to fill that void once this series ends. So.... if I never watch the end... it never ends. It becomes an open-ended series that I can just revisit whenever I want on my terms, when I need to self-medicate and turn off the rest of the world. 

Having no ending is better than having a definitive ending that I cannot control. Does the good guy win? Do they get married? What happens to the quirky supporting character that nobody focuses on? What happened at the end when all the void fell where they did?

I would rather not know for myself, and create a safe-space where my deepest insecurities won't be triggered. 

I hear the last episode of Friends was sweet and wholesome. I'll never know."
"High Functioning Borderlines can put on the mask required to function in the big wide world but this does not reduce the extremes, the emotions or the eratic thought patterns.",485,9gsb01,115,

Is anyone else terrified of phone calls and mail?,488,iy8qw5,85,"My heart jumps whenever the phone rings, and sometimes, to my great detriment, it is sometimes weeks before I can open a letter I get in the mail.  Just curious if anyone else here goes through this too.



Edit:  This question has received a vigorous response, and right now I'm overwhelmed, in a *good* way, by the feedback I have received.

Once again, I am amazed that I am not alone.  Although almost sixty years old, and have had the signs and symptoms of BPD staring my in my face for my entire life, this a a recent diagnosis for me, and my Recovery journey on the happy/sad/angry/crying and laughing at the same time trail has only just begun.  I don't know if I'm capable of responding to all of you (just reading your replies have turned me into a puddle) but I had a major PHONE CALL I had to deal with this afternoon- my first appointment with a psychiatrist for my BPD.  It went well, and now I'm just trying not to hyperventilate with relief it's over.

I give you much love, internet hugs, and understanding the hard to understand but so easy to relate to community that is here.

I have found my people, and they are we.  I'm not alone in this world.

Neither are you."
"Am I the only one that whenever I tell someone I have BPD they are like ""Oh no, you definitely don't have THAT.""",487,m8y7jb,116,"And everytime I have to explain that actually I do have it, and actually am suffering every fucking day.
But just because they compare me with the bad stigma of BPD I just don't have it. 

It is so frustrating and it really makes me believe even more that I am faking it/overreacting/lying to myself/doing it for attention.

I was diagnosed the first of March and I haven't even told that many people about it. It just baffles me that people would say such a thing without even doing a little bit of research."
Anyone else feel like they're the most annoying person ever?,485,ap4x34,72,"I feel like anytime I get attached to someone, I become the most annoying and insufferable person ever to them.  This causes me to not text or bother them in any way for fear that I'm annoying them and they probably don't want to hear from me and if I text them they feel obligated to answer me and if they actually wanted to talk to me they would text me first. 

I also think though that I'm annoying to everyone,  but I just don't care unless that person is important to me. I usually end up talking to the important people less than people who aren't as important to me just because the stress and anxiety that I'm annoying them scares me from even contacting them.  Whereas with the less important ones it's not a big deal if I'm annoying them because who cares if they don't want to talk to me anymore.  With an FP more is on the line if I start to annoy them. 

Idk.  Just some ramblings from me because I've been feeling lately like a joke and a loser and someone who nobody wants to be around because I'm so fucking irritating and stupid. It seems no amount of reassurance from anybody can change how I feel about that. "
Just a little reminder- Other people around you will not change their behaviour just because you choose to improve yourself. The path to recovery becomes slightly less painful when you remind yourself that you only have liability over your self and can't force people to change with you.,489,hjmoa3,24,"To elaborate- when you are taking certain actions to better yourself and recover in certain aspects remember that you cannot change people therefore, even if you are planning/dreaming on moving forward don't expect certain people to improve along with you. Let's say that you and your partner/dad/mom etc. have issues and you do not like their actions and behaviour. These will not necessarily change when you are changing. Instead of believing that people will eventually change their behaviour as you better yourself, it is better to wish for and learn improved ways of dealing with their actions instead.

I know that this is easier said than done but I think it is important to remember as we tend to 'dream' about how people will treat us differently if we change. Every time my life seems to be improving or every time something good happens, I seem to be caught in the illusion that my relationship with certain people will also suddenly improve and when it does not (since the other person has not changed), I feel despair and my improvement seems to go downhill as a result. Instead of thinking that these relationships will improve I find it more useful to work on changing my mindset and the way I approach these people (finding healthy coping mechanism to deal with them). I've tried changing people over and over again but it never works out so the only way is working on the way you perceive them and the problems they bring about instead of trying to change them.

I hope this reminder is useful to some of you as it has been helping me focus more on myself rather than basing my recovery on the improvement of others."
"People always talk about borderlines being abusive, but never how they are so prone to being abused themselves.",484,bo6ypb,76," I think once people are around someone with BPD they think ,no matter the situation, that person is the one being abusive and delusional. It sucks because you can’t even talk about it. Everything I say is just me over exaggerating or being “crazy”. I don’t even feel like a person anymore."
I never want to take my mask off,487,k6th3q,69,"To some, it's a minor inconvenience for a major benefit.

To others, it's an infringement on rights.

To me, it's protection from a different kind of virus--society.

Only having to show half of my face makes me feel half as insecure about what others might be thinking.

I'll take it!"
"Something that has worked for me trying to practice radical acceptance: I've started imagining emotions as literal beings I have to willingly invite into my ""house"" (mind) and validate/take care of.",481,jag6d9,25,"I started DBT not long ago and, after a major family fight, started trying to get back into my Buddhist practice as well. Buddhism isnt everyone's cup of tea, but one suggestion I got from a recent meditation/sermon I watched helped me so much.

The speaker talked about acknowledging an emotion  and literally welcoming it as if it's a guest in your home. Not forcing it out because then it will just get louder and louder. 

I took this a step further and started imagining my mind as a literal home (complete with decorations/design style/etc) and I started giving emotions physical characteristics and personalities to a degree. If I don't open the door, the emotions will bang on the windows and scream to try to get me to see them. If I open the door, I have to converse with them and understand what they're trying to say. 

Example of what I mean: I imagine chronic pain as a childlike personification of the nervous system. I imagined anger as a blob of red liquid that keeps pouring out if it's not placated. I imagined being overweight/body image as a kinda blob-like being who seems nervous and like they have no self esteem. Etc, etc. 

After they're in the house, I have to think about what they need to hear to not spiral out and make them feel validated/accepted. Like, what I can say to let them know I see them and I see reality for what it is. With chronic pain, I imagine saying something like ""I appreciate you trying to protect me and keep me safe. I'm sorry if it seems like I don't listen to you. I'm listening and I understand, but I also need to function every day."" Sometimes I even imagine doing kind or loving things for them like giving them soup or tea. I recently had a talk with injustice and was like ""You're right. It's super unfair. It's very unfair that you're in this situation and there's no solution. I heard a phrase once that might help you ""Problems have solutions. If there is no solution, there is no problem."" I think that might provide you some comfort while you come to terms with being mistreated and misunderstood.""

This practice has been one of the most helpful things for me in terms of changing my attitude and coming to terms with the chronic invalidation I felt growing up. I wanted to post it here for anyone struggling because I haven't seen anything quite like it discussed in terms of radical acceptance."
I’m (the) shit,484,jzmufs,66,"It’s one or the other. I either deserve to be dead or I’m a fucking superhero. 

And those two opinions don’t know each other. When one is present, the other one does not exist in any realm of consciousness.

'Family is everything' NOPE. FAMILY IS NOT EVERYTHING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SUFFER.,482,hrukq3,56,"I'm having a difficult time with my family and I just wanted to remind everyone that:

\- You don't owe your family anything

\- if they aren't good for you mental health, you can leave

\- if they routinely ignore your boundaries then please leave

I really want to stress how our well-being is much more important than family ties. If you have a supportive kind family, then wonderful. You are blessed.

Is anybody else into the *idea* of sex a lot more than actually having it?,483,9mctuu,54,"I love to be reassured that I'm wanted and what's a better way to show that than sharing something as intimate as sex?  Because of that, I'll be the most romantic and dtf person you've ever met right up until we're about to get down to business... then I feel like I've accomplished my goal and my mind is done with the whole situation.   
This has always been a frustrating issue for myself and my partners, but I'm just not into sex past the threshold of knowing it's going to happen; it doesn't feel particularly good (which, most of the time, means I'm pushing rope after a minute or two) and soon ends up becoming a chore. I got what I wanted -proof that I was worth something to you- the moment it got steamy, the next thirty minutes are going to be disappointing for both of us. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
Leave me alone,480,lkcgvh,85,"I am absolutely tired of people thinking they are so radical and accepting when they hear about my BPD only to be fucking awful once they see how it actually manifests. 

I understand being told about it versus seeing some of the symptoms in action are two different things, but it feels like people are just coming into my life to fuck with me at this point. I give them every possible out before things get too serious, they swear up and down they are up for any challenge and just adore me sooooo much they will do all that they can to make it work with me and help understand me as much as they can and then the literal first time something happens they act like I have two fucking heads.

I'm seeing someone new - I share that I have BPD, they are nothing but encouraging and supportive and loving to the point where it brings genuine tears of happiness to my eyes. Nobody has ever embraced hearing my suffering like that. Then we have our first argument. Then I'm being told I make you walk on a tightrope and that I'm lucky you love me.

Everyone needs to leave me alone, honest to God. I feel as though people make a game out of coming into my life, tearing down my walls and barriers, then being repulsed with what they see."

"I have an extremely needy cat, and it's probably the single best thing, ever, for my BPD!",478,dztm95,41,"She MUST spend at least 12 hours a day near me, if not laying on me.  She follows me from room to room, sits with me when I'm on the computer, she talks at me when I talk at her, and sleeps with her head tucked in my elbow.  

I need just as much attention as her, so I'm super happy to have her!  Maybe it reinforces my issues, maybe it helps me feel more loved.  I couldn't tell you which one, if not both. But, I can tell you, I wouldn't change her for anything."
Does anyone else with BPD have an abnormal relationship with food?,476,lg2jz1,129,"I have had a pretty toxic relationship when it's come to my own eating habit, I'll spear you all the detail but I find that somedays I will eat only one tiny thing and somedays I will eat all the junk food I want. When I do go through a depressive episode however I don't eat anything, I drink water but that's about it, I tend to always think I'm fat even when I lose a decent amount of weight becuase I won't eat and then I'll just say I'm not hunger

Does that happen to other people using starvation as a form of self-harm?

Edit: How this blew up I'd really like to say hi to everyone but I'm not sure I can but I do hope everyone is doing ok :D "

I mean that I want to wake up in the mornings, and have a simple cup of coffee without the anxiety, dread, and worry eating a hole in me. 

I mean that I want to maintain friendships and relationships instead of driving everyone away with the symptoms of this disorder. 

I mean that I want to be normal. I want to be content and happy, without overanalyzing whether I'm allowed to be, or whether it's right or wrong. Or feeling the dread of waiting for the inevitable crash that follows brief happiness. 

I mean that I don't want to feel like my life is a never ending circle of self-sabotage and pain and trauma. I mean that I want to be able to look in the mirror, and know who I am, instead of dissociating and never feeling 100% real or present. 

Just like, I wanna be normal."
so tired of romanticizing every person who looks my direction.,473,igevqa,87,"so i have this thing where i will notice someone looking at me, even just in passing, and i will immediately romanticize them as if the look is anything more than a passing glance. my brain will construct this entire scenario where they sometimes even stop me in my tracks to confess feelings for me, or tell me how attracted they are to me. it’s weird because 9/10 times i’m not even physically attracted to this person, but i still have these thoughts. i almost always end up feeling like shit afterwards because obviously these scenarios never pan out and i’m left with the thought that... oh yeah, i’m actually unloveable and this will never in a million years actually happen to me lmao.

it doesn’t just happen with complete strangers either. sometimes it’ll be co workers who are just being nice to me. my brain will construct this scenario where they’re actually in love with me and they give me this huge confession that they actually want to be with me. it’s so fucking weird.

the thing is, I never have any sort of feelings towards any of these people. rarely am i ever actually attracted to them either. so... i really don’t get it at all.

does anyone understand this, or deal with this at all?"
I think I helped an ER Doctor be more sensitive today,479,he5cjo,40,"I went to the ER (in my town that’s all we have now during Covid) because of rapid heartbeat and discomfort in my chest. I thought it was good old anxiety and needed a klonopin refill, which I hadn’t gotten since October (because Covid) - after determining I wasn’t “drug seeking” he gave me 25 count of .5mg clonazepam. Took it for two days with no relief. 

I went back to the ER this time with husband (insecure about going alone I’m sure you can relate) and I told him that normally one klonopin will help my anxiety and this wasn’t anxiety because it still hurt. I tried explaining it felt like my heart was racing, I had a lot of burping, and felt weak (probably from not eating since my esophagus felt inflamed). He said, “do you have a psychiatrist? you should see your psychiatrist” 

Immediately husband and I locked eyes. I just said “you see!” To my husband. I got up from the table mid-palpation, and said to the doctor “you’re patronizing me” and he said no no no. I said I’m telling you I’m having physical symptoms and you’re assuming because of my history that they’re in my head. You’re invalidating me and that’s not what a patient wants. Any patient but especially one with a history of mental illness. 

He said oh I’m sorry I didn’t mean to upset you. Etc. he left the room and came back a few minutes later. He apologized to me and said this “I left the room and thought about what you said. And you know what you’re so right. I’ll never do that to anyone else. I should have listened to you with respect and what I said WAS invalidating to you and your pain. I’m very sorry” 

My husband who is a medical professional also, said to me honey you should be proud of yourself because I think you taught him something today. 

Turns out I have GERD and the medicine has helped. But had I said nothing I would have believed it was all in my head too. And that’s just not fair. I also have to see a cardiologist for low blood pressure."
Mental illness is not an excuse for toxic behaviour,475,aflhg3,82,"It's not okay to hurt others regardless of what mental illness you have. It could be an explanation but you need to take responsibility for your behaviour and try help yourself. Hiding behind your illness, hurting/abusing/manipulating people then saying 'I have X, this is me, I can't change it' yes you can! It's not a get out of jail free card. Whenever I snap at people when I have meltdowns I always apologise afterwards."
"DAE get an overwhelming, painful, nostalgia-like feeling?",477,jv0b5e,58,"Sometimes before a period of time in my life ends, or if a person leaves, etc. I feel this overwhelmingly deep nostalgic sorrow. It's such a deep and powerful feeling, it's actually terrifying. It's like drowning in the ocean and struggling to keep my head above water. The feeling comes on like a giant wave; sometimes I'm overwhelmed with tears and start sobbing because of it. It happens during limerence episodes, but is not exclusive to them."
Just because I have a job and get out of bed in the morning doesn't mean I'm not struggling.,479,crthps,43,"I want to preface this with I am privileged. Not everyone has the same abilities as me, at least not yet. Everyone is at a different place with their mental health and I don't think I'm any better a person  than any of y'all. 

I have a full time job. I work in management. I have a long term, stable relationship. I have a support system. I pay rent and am financially stable(unless you look at my savings account Haha...). I have good days, lately I've had some hope.

Doctors look at that and tell me I'm stable. They say they're proud of me. That I'm doing well.

But I hurt myself. I want to kill myself half the time. I push people away. I have near daily breakdowns, I freak out over stupid shit. I can barely sleep sometimes because I'm plagued with intrusive thoughts and nightmares. I split on people I care about. 

I explode with anger, I hurt people. I can barely get out of bed some days. I struggle with disordered eating. I hate my body.

But because I walk into their office, self aware and calm, I'm fine. It feels so fucking invalidating and I've been unable to get proper treatment because of it.

Do I seriously have to have a suicide attempt or something before I'm taken seriously? Because I'll fucking do it. If my new therapist does the same thing, I'm going to do something drastic to get their attention. I started cutting again already and haven't told anyone, but I'm keeping it as ammo for if ONE more fucking person tells me I'm fine just because I can pay my goddamn rent.

I'm not fine. I'm not okay. I struggle EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY. Why is that so hard to see?

I know things will get better. I have some optimism. But I'm prepared to let them get a whole lot worse if that's what it takes."

You are not a monster,471,clk50o,43,"I've seen a lot of posts from people worrying that they arent a good person. I've been there. Then I learned more about bpd and realized that I'm not a manipulative monster, I am a complex human being with deep capacity for emotions; some of which are bad.

Truly bad people dont lie awake at night worrying that they are bad people.

Just the fact that you are aware of your faults and want to change means you are a good person.

Self gaslighting?,467,manimd,55,"Does anyone else do this? I tend to belittle my own feelings with thoughts like, ""oh I'm just making a big deal out of nothing"" or just full stop invalidate my own feelings. Constantly putting myself down for things that aren't out of my control, stuff like that.

I used to think it was some kind of healthy coping mechanism (""oh it's no big deal, champ!""), but a friend of mine actually called me out on this.

Having such an abusive relationship with yourself is exhausting, and it's the one relationship you can't bring to an end regardless of how much you try and sabotage it."
DAE get suicidal ideations/extreme hatred for yourself just over your body image or appearance?,472,j5dr3g,50,"I think one of my biggest triggers for emotional dysregulation and thoughts of hating myself/wanting to harm myself comes from moments when I feel insecure about my body or start comparing myself to other people’s appearances. I really lose my sense of self so easily over my own image. In my head it feels like no one would pick me as someone to date or be friends with over someone with my personality but a better body or face, if that makes sense? So then why would I even waste my time existing if there are people who are better than me in every aspect possible. Idk it’s probably also related to my own body dysmorphia problems and self confidence issues but I also feel like having BPD just makes it even more intense???


edit: just wanted to add a quick lil edit since there are so many responses bc I just want to say thank you to everyone who responded and being open with how you feel :') It makes me sad that our brains are wired to think this way and how BPD really messes with our sense of self, but we are all so strong even just for being here and alive today!"
DAE have such a strong desire to make friends but then have no energy to maintain them?,470,aju54w,34,"I’ve always wanted to have a strong friendship with someone like I did before I started to slip into this world of BPD and mental illness. But anytime I’m given the opportunity to make a friend I fuck it up by bailing on them, ghosting them, etc. because I’m so unhappy with myself that I don’t want to burden anyone else with my issues. I also have PTSD from an old friendship that still bothers me to this day so it makes me even more “IDGAF” towards maintaining a friendship. I hate myself so much and I hate that I treat people in this manor, I don’t say rude things to people... I just completely isolate myself instead and ignore everything around me.

I met a super sweet girl who’s bipolar and like legit my twin but I can’t even maintain a friendship with her because I barely have enough energy for myself and I don’t know if this is me self-sabotaging. I feel so bad because she wants to hangout and talk so much and all I do is ignore her like the asshole I unintentionally make myself out to be."
DAE feel a loss of memory or thoughts when trying to explain how you feel?,470,lsvyq4,50,"Sometimes while intensely feeling something and trying to explain it, i get lost in my own words. i think it could be from the way i kinda of jump around when trying to explain my feelings.. but I'm starting to understand that having a couple mins space away from the person, helps the best to calm down and to be able to think clearer. Time outs are good for both people to think instead of flaming a fire."
I am amazing until you get to know how unbearably sad I am,468,f7suvc,65,"I finally figured it out.

I am not a bad person!! I'm really fucking awesome actually, I'm funny I'm talented I'm smart I have so much going for me except I'm unbearably sad.

When I'm happy people basically fall in love with me, but guess what? I'm not happy any more than I am sad. Actually! I am sad almost all the fucking time. 

I always assumed people left me because I'm a shitty person but I'm not I'm just really exhausting and no one can take it 

Shit, if I could abandon myself I fucking would too. 

Who can handle the constant meltdowns, the crying, the anxiety, the irritability on a constant basis??

Not me! And definitely not anyone else. 

Honestly the fact that people make it almost a whole year is pretty impressive. No one has made it past that my entire life. (Except my family 😬) 

I have been sad my whole damn life. I have been in therapy since I was a child. I've been in therapy so much that I end up being a therapist to other people all the damn time, and I'm really good at it.

But my dumb ass has a hard time being my own therapist. I end up asking it of other people and yeah no one signed up for that job and no one wants it. 

I don't do it on purpose. I have a huge problem with always being honest and always sharing my feelings. I never learned to just keep shit to myself. I mean my whole life is on display, I'm not afraid to say anything ever. People love my honesty and how genuine I am but god damn I'm so fucking unstable 

When will I learn to keep my mouth shut. How many people have to leave me before I learn my lesson?! 

I really get why people kill themselves. I don't want to, but I understand. 

I guess I'm just wondering, does it ever get better? Yes, it gets easier. But, is there hope that someday I won't be sad so much? Is there hope that I will someday learn to be happy? 

I don't know. Sorry for the rant."
Will NOT stalk,469,cvkb29,63,"To anyone who needs to hear this,

Do **NOT** stalk. Stalking is a slippery slope. One thing will lead to another, and you'll end up reopening the wound over and over again. Do not let your thoughts get the better of you 'cause once you cave in, it's hard to regain control.

Do **NOT** stalk. The anxious/agitated feeling you get before stalking is superior compared to what you would feel upon stalking and potentially discovering things that would hurt/harm you.

Do **NOT** stalk. Do you realise the need to stalk diminishes when you're busy/having fun? That's because your mind is preoccupied. Keep yourself busy whenever the urge comes and it too shall pass.

Do **NOT** stalk. They're not thinking of you as much as you think about them; it's nothing personal, that's just how neurotypicals are wired. Use the time that you have to focus on yourself and your self-growth. The happier you are with yourself, the easier it would be to move on.

Do **NOT** stalk. Let yourself feel the emotions and let yourself heal. Over time, the need to stalk will dissipate completely. Keep going!

Do **NOT** stalk. You're a fighter. You got this."
Chronic emptiness explanation,470,jkvyf7,50,"My emptiness is not just a bad feeling I get when I’m in a bad mood, it’s a constant feeling I feel internally. A grey bleak feeling of nothingness but constant emotional pain/sadness. It’s an extreme boredom and almost irritating feeling of.. what can fill me up? Drugs? Alcohol? Relationships? Sure it may “help” for a bit but I always crash and end up feeling empty again. It’s like putting gas in a car only to realize there’s a giant hole and all the fuel is pouring out. 

Chronic emptiness is feeling like somethings missing but knowing nothing can ever fill that void, so you just exist.

It’s making reckless decisions so life can feel entertaining, it’s constantly looking for stimuli to keep your energy levels up, and it’s going through crying spells just to remind yourself that you do indeed, feel. 

Of course I’m capable of feeling happy, of course I have good days. But my chronic emptiness will always be a struggle, as I continue to live my life, seeking for that SOMETHING to fill me up and keep me alive."
Does anyone else ever feel just absolute rage?,469,jgad2t,110,"I mean rage so intense that you want to hurt people, or smash and destroy things, even if you don’t want to.

"Anyone go between feeling overly confident to insecure, back and forth, without any common ground? Is self-splitting a thing???",465,fda1fr,44,"I feel conflicted. Once again... I feel insanely ugly and unattractive. 

I idealize myself and also deminimize myself, respectively.

I go for weeks at a time being super conceded (I don't brag to others), but I look often in the mirror and preceive myself as being ""a catch"" or ""irresistible""

Then all of a sudden, I feel embaressed for thinking so highly of myself and fall into this pit of insecurity and self esteem issues.

I look in the mirror and see every imperfection. I envy other women (secretly) and wish looked like them. I feel fat and start starving myself and going on rediculous diets. I hate my nose. I hate having small boobs (b cups), I hate having small hips. I hate that my hair gets fizzy so quickly (curly hair) and the length. I could name a million things and not one thing that I like about myself.

Then something switches and all of a sudden I feel overaly confident once again


I wish I had some common ground and rationale, I wish I could look at myself as average and be ""ok"" and ""happy"" with that.

Either im perfect or imperfect. 

I literally not only split with the most important people of my life, but I also split with myself.


I feel triggered when someone judges my appearance even unintentionally and I start picking on myself.
I also find myself overly confident when I receive multiple compliments. 

I think that may have to do something with the black and white thinking of my own self"
"DAE go through phases of being super motivated to get better, then losing all motivation and just not caring?",469,e8chmg,62,"Sorry for the wordy title, i don’t know how else to put it.

I keep on going through this cycle. Usually after having a good couple of days, I’ll suddenly become really positive and motivated to throw myself into recovery and make my life as good as I possibly can.

I make mental plans about trying even harder in therapy, improving my eating habits, getting a good sleeping pattern, exercising more, saving money, investing time in my hobbies, getting organised, going back to work with a perfect attendance record, having perfect relationships with people, and not wasting a single second of my days. At the time it feels like it’s all possible and i’ve cracked the code to being mentally healthy. i’m ready to put 100% effort into it all.

And then a few days later or however long it takes my mindset completely changes. Suddenly i just don’t care about any of that stuff, and achieving even a single one of the goals i thought about seems impossible. The motivation turns to nothing and i feel like i’m never going to change, even if i try to do so. I almost laugh at my past self for being so hopeful because it feels ridiculous now. i’d rather just waste my time away until it runs out.

Rinse and repeat. DAE?"
"It took 17 years, but I overcame BPD and depression to finally graduate from college!",469,c3qfr8,65,"Since this subreddit won't allow me to post photos, here's a link!  [https://imgur.com/a/GvP2VPK](https://imgur.com/a/GvP2VPK)

I struggled like everyone else. I never gave up, even when I wanted to. When I tried to. Just try to survive for another day. Just one more day. These days will add up. It was very, very hard for me but you can do it too. It might take a while, it might seem impossible, but you will get there."
"I can process information logically, but I cannot allow myself to believe it.",472,eaea34,56,"For example, when a person I'm texting back and forth with suddenly stops responding, I am able to logically recognize there are multiple possibilities: a) they are busy, b) there is nothing left for them to say, c) their phone died, or d) etc. There are so many logical reasons for a text going unanswered. I recognize this.

However, my BPD does not allow me to believe this. All I can believe is a) I said something wrong, b) they don't want to have a relationship with me anymore, or c) our future interactions will be tainted by this one texting experience.

Does this happen to anyone else? How can we process and accept logical information + conclusions instead of our obsessive thoughts?

The constant need to go home,467,czwcod,61,"Does anyone else feel this? You are home, in your house, in your room, but you want to go home. It’s a yearning that won’t leave, makes you scared, sad, and anxious. I get this feeling strongly sometimes and just spiral. It’s lonely."

"Anyone else feel like they have no real personality, sense of self or even direction in life?",470,gvrgeu,40,"24m here. Anyone else feel like when they talk to others that they are wearing a mask, and that that mask can change depending on which group of people you are with? I feel like I have no real personality, no real morals or valuesm. My political views constantly switch from right to left & vice versa, I have no definable musical or fashion tastes and what I like can differ depending on who I'm with. I can also feign interest in things very easily in order to blend into social groups and situations.
     However, this has left my with a deep sense of emptyness in my life, I feel like I'm free falling through life with nothing to cling onto and no direction. I'm 24 and since leaving school 6 years ago I have basically had a different career path every year since then, that being switching between college courses or employment, from working in finance, being a gym instructor, briefly studying politics, to wanting to become a chef. I have nothing to show for my life thus far and fear I never will due to lacking sense of self, and peers my age already have career and financial stability whereas I do not as I just don't know what to do and I don't really know who am I and what I want to do."
Anyone else treat all the compliments they get as fake and all insults as true?,468,a5lo1g,49,"I have a problem of anytime someone tells me I did something right or good, they're either lying to intentionally validate/decieve me, or misinformed and don't actually know enough to give me a valid appraisal.

Anyone else feel like this?"
"My Theory on BPD Behavior and Empathy - (Some ppl believe we don't have empathy... but we have a lot of empathy - except at times we are in extreme distress. In that state, almost any person acts like someone with BPD.)",465,lc0zcg,68,"It is difficult to focus on another persons' feelings when the intensity of your own pain drowns out everything around you...

Any person in extreme distress (physical or emotional) is going to experience something similar to a person with BPD. A person on fire is going to be emotional, kicking and screaming. A person suffering a lot of pain will become focused on themselves because their #1 priority is relieving that intense pain. A person who gets stabbed by another is not going to feel empathy for the person who harmed them in the immediate moment. That's simply self-preservation. (This is also demonstrated by the lack of empathy some normal people feel towards those with BPD because they've been hurt by someone with the disorder.)

Someone with BPD feels extreme pain at the slightest touch, so at the moment they are hurting, they are likewise going to become emotional, self-centered, and show little empathy for the person who hurt them. It does not matter that the person had no intention of doing it... It may appear trivial to them. To the person with BPD, however, significant damage was done to them. 

I am not saying it excuses BPD behavior or does not look like something else to the outside, but even after enough therapy to recognize that other people do not mean you harm... It still takes so much self-control not to react as though that person just caused you extreme harm... because the pain makes it feel that way. It feels like being on fire but trying to ignore it so that you don't react as if you're on fire."
There needs to be more awareness for those of us with a toxic abusive FP.,467,k7azhj,94,"People who suffer BPD are often stigmatized as the bad guys. And we all know that to be a hurtful stigma, and untrue. Many of us are really clingy and loyal almost to a fault, and become people pleasers for our FP. 

But something i wish had more awareness is the fact that we’re perfect targets for narcissists and abusive people. Our clingy loyal nature is perfect for abusers to dangle over our heads, and keep us attached, even when they do us wrong. 

I feel like a lot of us are potentially attached to someone who we know is not good for us. Yet we can’t seem to shake them from our hearts."
"It’s so ironic and frustrating how I’m terrified of abandonment, but at the same time this disorder regularly makes me feel like I need to cleanse my life from people on a regular basis...",466,jo858e,31,"Seriously what’s up with this freaking disorder?? I can’t stop analyzing and overthinking everyone’s actions just so I can catch them doing me wrong. Or just randomly wanna stop talking to everybody forever. But god forbid them not replying me for five minutes. So tiring :(

Edit: I am comforted by the fact that I seem not to be alone in this. Wanna say that hopefully all of us will reach the end of this bloody disorder and live in prosperity and health. Might be too corny to say, or you may not resonate with it at all like I don’t at this moment, but whoever and wherever you are, we’re in this together! Sending good vibes."
I think I'm in love with everyone that is nice to me,461,ltwufj,41,"I have a boyfriend who is very nice to me, mostly very supportive and treats me well. I don't know if I'm in love with him because I always start to think he wants to kill me / he hates me / he's angry at me, but otherwise we are okay I think.

My issue is that every time I meet a friend and I have a good time I start feeling like I'm in love with that person. I start ignoring my boyfriend's texts and I feel like all I want to do is be with that friend forever. Does anyone have any experience with something similar? Any ideas why it happens? Do I not love my boyfriend or what's going on...."
For those like me that can’t keep a job,461,kvntxt,74,"I highly recommend instacart, its decent money (guaranteed 17.50 an hour), all you need is a background check and you basically just deliver groceries to people. You hardly have to interact with anyone.

I dont know about other people, but what really bothers me about workplaces is the social dynamics. Some workplaces, especially the restaurant industry or sales, seem almost like cults, where you need the exact same attitude and energy as everybody else to be seen as a positive member. 

A lot of us are hypersensitive to how we are perceived by our superiors which leads to either people pleasing or quitting from rejection-based fears. For some of us if even if one person doesn’t like us its game over."
"Y'all ever meet someone & immediately wanna spend eternity with them, only to kinda hate them like 3 weeks later?",463,hrdlfk,57,"Almost a month ago, I started seeing my current romantic partner. Everything was amazing at first -  they seemed like exactly the type of person I needed, and vice versa. I was so excited to have finally met someone I could see a future with, and I asked myself multiple times ""Am I idealizing this person, or is this really someone I could be happy with?"" 

&#x200B;

I couldn't think of any unfavorable qualities that I was overlooking, or any mediocre ones that I was romanticizing. I put a lot of thought into making sure of that, because I have a HUGE tendency to idealize people & fall in love with those idealizations. Still, after pondering it with myself, I came to the conclusion that I had finally met someone great who I could see myself being with.

&#x200B;

 I felt like this for about 2.5 weeks, until a little over a week ago. I had spent every single day and night with this person for the entirety of those 2.5 weeks, and then I started to feel burnt out. So I decided I wanted to spend a few days and nights at home by myself/with my family. This is when my opinion of my partner began to really change. I don't know if the impression that I had of them during those 2.5 weeks was a front and they just got comfortable enough to stop putting effort into it, or if I had actually idealized them during that time and the idealization was fading.

&#x200B;

Either way, for a little over a week now I've been really turned off and irritated by their company. It's making me sad because they're really so good to me, to the best of their ability, and in no way are they a bad person. I'm just not happy with them anymore. I really don't want to hurt them, because I don't think this is really their fault? I mean they've done/said quite a few childish & inconsiderate things lately, but it's not their fault that now that's ALL I notice/think about. I feel like I need to break this off, for both of our best interest, but I don't even know how to go about explaining myself. I know it's gonna hurt them a lot, and I feel horrible about that because they really don't deserve that. 

&#x200B;

 I keep wondering if maybe I'm in a manic phase of pessimism that I can wait out or if this is a lost cause. Who knows, maybe I could become enamored with them all over again, just as suddenly as I became so off-put. Is it fair to wait and see? Is it fair to really hurt this person by leaving them all over what could just be a manic episode? If it is just an episode, then it's sure to happen again, and over time, the relationship would fail anyway, right? I feel very conflicted and guilty right now. Any insight or advice would be much appreciated."

Anyone else feel emotional distance from humanity due to how long you've have to fight your battles alone?,465,l8cai1,31,"In September of last year I realized that for my entire life I have had to deal with all my problems alone. And no, it's not that people haven't ""tried"" per say it's just I've rarely ever met anyone with anything relevant to say. I've basically been my own therapist for the last 5 years. I have saved myself from suicide. Got myself out of horribly depressive states into states of euphoria. Everything I have ever accomplished was solely because of me. But as a result I simply do not feel anything emotionally towards humanity anymore.

I no longer have morals. And while I do have empathy, especially towards children, I generally don't feel much towards people anymore. Even the friends I have. Once shit gets tough I socially isolate. Having to fight all of my worst battles completely alone while everyone else just dicks around hasn't made me hate humanity but I sure as shit don't feel like I owe them anything. Rarely feeling anything towards my friends either makes me feel weird as fuck sometimes."

I gaslighted my boyfriend,461,aukovu,33,"Before I came across this subs I didn't even know what gaslighting was. It was something so ingrained in our family dynamic that I didn't realise how toxic it was. My nmom is the worst for it. I never had a name for it but I just knew there was no point in ever challenging her about anything because her story always changes.

Well, this weekend I was the one to do it. I'm ashamed to admit that this is not my first time, but I'm actively working to change.

My partner very kindly did lots of house work, as this is a contentious issue for us at times, when I saw he had done so much I didn't know if saying thank you and making a big deal would cause tension so i left it with the aim to say thank you later.

As I was making lunch he made a light hearted comment about how I didn't thank him for doing the housework. Instead of apologising and saying it in the moment I replied ""I did, can't you remember"". 

As soon as the words left my mouth my heart sunk. Yuck what was I doing. So I quickly caught myself and said, ""oh shit I didn't actually say it, did I? I just thought it. Doesn't really count when you do that, sorry haha"" and then proceeded to tell him how thankful I was.

I hate that this is an automatic response for me to lie like this, but hopefully if I keep challenging myself I can eradicate it from my reflexes."
anyone else have zero control over your mental state and just ride the waves?,462,kr3mgc,59,"For example, if I’m in a depressive episode, no matter how much effort I put into therapy & self improvement, it doesn’t really make a difference. I just have to wait for my life to suddenly become bright and happy again. (This literally happens). My life is just a series of waves that I have to surrender to. This not only applies to my mental state, but also external events. After a shift into a happy episode, my life literally gets better in ways that aren’t even affected by my actions. 

After a while, it dips down again and I’m in a trough. Without reason, I slowly become miserable. The external world treats me differently. I become unlucky. I usually will struggle financially and stupid shit repeatedly happens. I have no control over when it begins and ends, but I can sense an upcoming shift. 

This is actually why I feel connected to astrology. For my entire life, I seem to go through phase after phase without instigating them myself. I don’t change my life. If someone tells me “I’m so proud of you! It takes so much work and courage to get better!” I’m just like....I didn’t do anything. It just happened. 

In the past I’ve even gone through weird physical phases where I’d be chronically nauseous or anxious for a few months, and then it would simply disappear altogether. For no reason.

"when i hit it off with someone, i don't want to see them again because i feel i can't live up to who i made them think i am",456,co76pf,65,"does anyone else experience this flavor of crazy?

I wasn't putting on an act when I met that person, I was instead somehow able to enter a tiny window of not feeling self conscious. I might even think something like 'ah, the problem was that i hadn't been meeting interesting enough people but now that i have, i'll be okay and can have a solid friend'. Then suddenly I feel like if I made someone like me or warm up to me I can only let them down next time, or that i'd have to fake it to be with them again. In reality i didn't make them do anything. they probably simply liked me, but the thought of that throws my mind into all sorts of turmoil because i don't know who it was that they liked. i end up feeling a lot safer, but emptier and much more lonely, hanging around people who are so self centered that they barely know the other person is there or has any feelings."

How to be my FP in 3 easy steps,455,ckwy9d,71,"1. Be sexually attracted to me, even if you just want to use me like a slightly more interactive fleshlight. 
2. Show me any type of affection, even if it’s cuddling me while you’re so drunk that I could be a pillow for all you care
3. Be emotionally distant and only communicate with me when it’s convenient for you because I love feeling desperate for some reason!

If you can do all three things, there’s a 100% chance I will dedicate my life to you and feel like shit about myself all the while until you ghost me completely!"
Shame is why I react so extremely to minor inconveniences but can handle serious trauma in a healthy way.,455,aw4ysi,20,"I have always been so baffled by my own life because I have been through a lot of extremely negative experiences outside of my control and powered through them, but I am absolutely awful at coping with minor inconveniences.

If a friend has to cancel on me or does something that lets me down, I feel sad and disappointed, and it spirals out of control.

It’s taken me a long time to realize that the reason that it’s so hard for me to deal with these moments is that I am aware that I shouldn’t be reacting to them in such an extreme way. 

I obviously recognize that shit just happens, and the world isn’t out to get me. People will always disappoint me in some way, and it’s not always their fault if people do something that disappoints me. 

BUT I feel strong emotions all of the time, and I can’t just turn them off.

So, when I feel strong emotions in response to something minor, I am so ashamed and angry at myself for feeling those strong emotions that it spirals out of control. 

When really bad things happen to me, I feel like my emotions are valid, and that allows me to work through the situation without breaking down. 

This is why it is so important to remind ourselves that emotions themselves are valid. 

Yes, we feel very extreme emotions in situations when other people might not feel those emotions, but that doesn’t mean that there’s something fundamentally wrong with us. It just is what it is.

Does anyone else feel like the only way you can deal with the past is pretending it didn’t happen,458,ls4rj8,43,"I feel like the way that I get over things is by pretending 1 year ago was a past life or that I hatched out of the ground as an adult just recently lmao. I don’t know if that makes sense. I tend to ruminate about my past and my relationships that fell apart a lot, and especially at night to the point where I’ll find some new detail deep in my memory to be mortified by and it really wears me down so I try to disconnect from my past as much as possible. I did this with grade school as soon as I entered high school but then I felt like I had no personality and now that I’m out of high school I feel like I’m trying to do the same."
"Anyone else realize that if you didn’t start conversations with people, you wouldn’t have any at all?",454,i7n7j9,29,"I just realized, I start ALL the conversations I have with people. An old friend of mine started a DM with me out of nowhere. It was doing alright at first, catching up. Then as I usually do, the feelings I had for them in the past (platonic? maybe?) came rushing back and I began to feel myself becoming attached again. 

So throughout the day, I continued to try to have a conversation. I guess I figured, “they started the conversation, that must mean they want to be friends again?” They did say they wanted to be friends again, so I was like cool! I have no one so this will surely help. But alas, it never lasts.

But they stopped replying, when they did it was short. Stuff like “Yeah” “Lol” etc. So i start spiraling into thinking I did or said something wrong, or maybe one of our past mutual friends said something about me (We had a bad falling out because after i was assaulted, they blamed me for it.) 

Which made me realize as a whole, huh. I really am the only one to talk to people. If I don’t talk to anyone and stop replying, that is the permanent end of our conversations. No one checks on me, no one asks how i’m doing, what i’m doing, asks me to hang out, etc. It’s always me, every single time. 

I am so incredibly immensely lonely. It’s hard to describe accurately HOW lonely I feel. It’s like the deepest, most intense sense of grief, darkness and sorrow that one can describe. In life, I am completely a shadow. No one pays attention to me, not even my parents. I am so, so lonely and in so much pain. I don’t even want to be around anymore, but I don’t know what i’d do or where i’d go, or anything.

I check in on my so called “friends” a lot. Just ask them if they’re doing alright, ask what they’re doing, etc. One of my friends, I’ve asked her to hang out twice now and she skirts around the question. I know it’s me, I know I must be doing something wrong? I’m never clingy or emotional around any of the “friends” i talk to, so I know that can’t be it. So what is wrong with me?

It just doesn’t feel like there’s a point in living right now when I break everyone who gets close to me. Will it ever get better? Please send support, I really need it."
Is anyone else super super sensitive to people's tone of voice when saying something?,453,eqbj0k,32,"I feel like it makes a HUGE difference for me, whether you are talking to me in person or through text. You can say just about the same thing, but the wrong phrasing versus the right phrasing makes a world of difference.

I'm honestly not sure if it is a BPD thing, but I feel like it would make sense for it to be.

A bad tone just comes off to me as incredibly rude and inconsiderate whereas a thoughtful, more sensitive tone conveying the same exact information comes off as 10x nicer.

It would be like if someone said, ""You need to be able to handle this workload if you are going to make it through grad school"" versus ""I think this introductory class is a great opportunity for you to grow more accustomed to the standard workload involved with being a graduate student."" It says the same information, but the second version sounds much more positive and encouraging rather than feeling like I'm being attacked. The first tone makes me feel super dysfunctional and horrible about myself.

Another example: ""I can tolerate our lack of a sex life for now I guess"" versus ""I understand that you are working through trauma in therapy right now and am willing to put sex on hold for now since I know that ultimately your goal is to fix the problem."" Big difference, but it conveys the same information. One feels like a slap in the face and the other feels encouraging and understanding.

Edit: 

The wording wouldn't have to be that extreme, but the same phrase with a different tone can feel that drastic in person. The wording or context is more relevant in writing.

Sometimes it is literally the same sentence with the wrong tone or poorly timed sighs."
"I know it isn't a big deal, but I haven't used selfharm in a month and haven't taken Xanax unless I was actually panicking since July 1st.",455,ee653t,63,"I used to cut myself on a regular basis (like every day), and it is incredibly rare now. My last 3 times:  November 22nd, October 27th, September 16th.

I have taken hardly any Xanax since July 1st. I used to take A LOT (at its worst about 4-6mg). I rarely ever take it now and only ever take it if I am really panicking (and then it is in small amounts). My pill usage in general has greatly decreased since July 1st. Almost cut in half I would say. I have gotten off 2 medications and am almost all the way off another one.

So this is my progress post!

Edit: I suppose it is a big deal. I just have a hard time feeling proud of myself. I got a tattoo over my worst scars a few years back as a promise, and I broke that promise. Maybe that is why I feel like it isn't as big of a deal as it should be."
does anyone else fear that they are being manipulative in everything they do?,453,kri7l0,82,"ive been seeing bpd being demonized a lot on social media and its kinda fucked with me a lot. i see lots of people saying that people with bpd’s first instinct is to manipulate people and always have manipulative tendencies. ive never felt like my first intention is to manipulate anybody and when i later realize that maybe i did accidentally unknowingly manipulate somebody into feeling bad for me and in the past not leaving me i feel so absolutely horrible. i am not proud of myself and i know that what i did was not right.

recently ive been so afraid that im just being shitty all the time. if someone hurts my feelings i dont even want to tell them because im terrified that im gonna be manipulative into making them feel bad about themselves or something. ive just been taking everything out on myself. i cant even talk to my girlfriend because im so absolutely scared of somehow being manipulative. tonight i told her i felt like she was maybe not wanting to hang out with me as much and liked someone else more than me and she apologized and said that wasnt true but i feel like somehow that was manipulative or something. i was just sharing a concern that i had and wanted to make sure everything was fine but seeing her apologize to me freaked me out and made me feel like a shitty person."
Someone from here used me to fulfill their sadism I guess,450,ip9svw,106,"I had recently made a post here about being abandoned by someone I loved and how it's made me nonfunctional, and someone saw it and began messaging me pretending to care about my wellbeing and asking if I needed to vent. 
I was reluctant at first but decided to give them a chance,  I started telling them about my hobbies and sharing photos of my animals and I expressed my fear of being randomly blocked because people abandon me that way all the time 
Then they did exactly that.  
I would like to know the point of reaching out to a suffering person,  coaxing them into a sense of security, and then hurting them on purpose.  
It's disgusting."
"After losing my job due to Chronic Health issues, I started working on something that allows you to see how your daily activities and factors such as Sleep, Diet, Exercise and Medication correlate with your mood and symptoms.

I have people that tell me I'm beautiful but I just don't see it. On a good day, I'm average at most. I mostly don't like my face and I'm wondering how to move past this. I used to be able to take pictures of my face without a filter and now I can't even do that because it's too triggering. Does anyone else struggle a lot with this?? Any advice to overcome it??"
Do you ever completely lose your s**t then feel completely embarresed and ashamed after?,453,jc0kq3,69,"Sometimes I lose perspective and get so angry or hurt that I don't represent myself in a way that I ever would in my ""normal"" state. Today, I lost a music project I was working on due to a computer glitch and ended up catastrophizing and screaming the f word about 100 times with intermittent sentences about my life being worthless, not knowing how I would be able to make it through the week with things being this way .. ect.  in my back yard, to make matters worse .. (because I was trying to not punch my doors or walls) , completely forgetting that a small child lives next to me.   No one said anything to me, but I imagine all my neighbors heard. But the only one I really care about is that little kid. Maybe 6 or so. Immense shame thinking of the  awful toxic obscene language and demeanor I very likely introduced to that child. Do any of you ever act, or react in a way that makes it harder to live with yourself after the fact? I hate how I still can't catch it even though I know I can ... if that makes sense."
Does anyone else notice that people fall in love with them really fast?,449,fhaj6k,141,"I’ve noticed that men seem to fall in love with me really fast. I can’t seem to have a male friend of any sort without them developing feelings for me and I’m not really sure why. I’m not super attractive or anything so the only thing I can come up with is that they fall in love with the person I made for them. I mold  myself into what they want, what they like, I from my personality based on their traits. It’s like getting a custom made car made special for you instead of just choosing a car from the lot. Does anyone else experience this?"

I also go absolutely crazy every single time I get a paycheck from work and within a week I am broke again. However, I cannot seem to fathom the idea of asking for a favor from someone because it makes me seem like I am absolutely worthless and need to rely on other people. Anyone else have this? Brand new to this sub btw, as I was diagnosed about two weeks ago. :)"
bpd is so painful :(,453,hwmeih,164,"the amount of mental & physical pain i go through everyday because i’m a borderline is unreal. i feel sick constantly, my chest feels like it’s caving in, anxiety attacks, intrusive thoughts, hallucinations, disassociation, suicidal tendencies, manic behaviour, rage, feeling as if EVERYONE hates me constantly, overthinking every tiny detail of everything, fear of people, not being able to communicate with anyone, feeling completely insane, self hatred to self love in seconds, body dysmorphia, feeling as if i’m not real and like i’m in a dream, extreme paranoia, self harm, overusing drugs/alcohol. i didn’t ask for this. i have absolutely no control over any of my emotions. i feel all of these things every single day and more too. i yet want to be normal. i fucking HATE bpd. if anyone can relate to me please comment, i need people who understand me i literally feel crazy💔"
"Does anybody else internally think ""I want to break up!"" after every argument or small thing happening",448,cu077z,85,I'm wondering if anybody else thinks that? Me and my partner had a small argument earlier and I was furious and was thinking that we should break up. I hate it.
People say I’m kind and pretty and likeable and everyone wants to be my friend,455,9tcyvx,106,"They have no idea I obsessively think about crashing my car almost every time I drive it

They don’t know that I live in complete fucking filth. That my bedroom is piled with garbage and bags of garbage and bottles and cans everywhere and purchases from 6 months ago still with tags on, and scattered items all leftover from 98 hobbies I took interest in for all but 5 minutes...

That I’ve been wearing the same pajama pants for 7 days and they literally fucking smell but you can bet I will put them back on again as soon as I get home

And they have no clue how much deodorant and dry shampoo I use because I usually feel that I don’t deserve to be clean and showered

They think that I’m busy when I’m really just buried inside my trashed, junked room, barely existing

They don’t know that I like to people-watch from my window and I do it often, that I find comfort in it, because I rarely think that I deserve to exercise, or even be outside..

That I binge eat and withhold food all the time

They don’t know about my thousands of credit card debt

They don’t know that lately I’ve been waking up more often than not with a severely intrusive urge to drink

They don’t know that when I found that mans wallet on the floor at the bar which I returned untouched, it was full of large bills and I cried HARD in the bathroom after because the voice was screaming STEAL IT STEAL STEAL and the urge was so intense and the automatic rush made my head hurt

They DEFINITELY don’t know that I spend most of my time thinking about them, how one minute I cry irrationally in fear for their lives, and the next minute I’m digging my nails into my palms furiously brainstorming ways to ensure they never leave me

They definitely don’t know that I don’t deserve any of them because I would rather be sad and alone than have to see their reactions to me pathetically admitting my devastation

They don’t know that I have no fucking idea who I am because I always forget.



If you actually got this far, thanks for reading. I wrote this earlier and chilled out a bit since.
Fun fact: after I wrote this my boyfriend gave me some attention and I was like wow im awesome I’m the best...right? Then he didn’t answer my text for 20 min and I just knew for that 20 min that he was probably never going to talk to me again. Here’s the shocker: he was just fucking busy lol


Edit: for a while, it was really hard for me to reply to everyone for some reason and I'm really sorry :( but I'm ready now cuz I've been feeling a lot better. Started dbt and feel my meds working. You guys have no idea how much I appreciate you. Thank you SO much. Hugs to every single one of you xx"
DAE feel like sharing their feelings is manipulative?,445,m0us9e,71,"I'm not going to get into it too heavily, but my wife and I are going through an extremely rough point in our marriage and it may not recover, and it is because of my stupid actions and choices. I have been spending the last 4 months trying to better myself and be a better spouse. My hope is that she will see my progress and my whole hearted attempts to win her back and want to stay, but that is up to her. 

Since then, knowing the pain I have caused her is the heaviest weight. Even though when I am calm I work to forgive myself and be a better man, when I hit my lows I feel like a pile of trash and I worry that my presence is only going to make her life worse. On top of that, my dad is in the hospital and it seems like every other day my mother calls me to tell me he is still in critical condition and that there is something else wrong and that I can't visit him because of COVID. Today, I just burst into tears on the phone with my wife and when she got home from work I just went and hugged her and cried and started to tell her how sorry I was and how I let everyone down and I just cried and cried. She ended up comforting me, but now I am sitting here feeling even worse because I feel like I have no right to show her how much I am struggling with myself after all the pain I caused her, but I also know I have to be honest and that hiding parts of myself was a huge part of the issues in the first place but she is also hurting and doesn't need to feel obligated to help me because I want to make her feel safe and my mind just keeps going and going. I am trying to calm down now, but I wanted to post here anyway and see if anyone else has been through feeling like they should share their feelings and just shut up, and if you ever found a balance."
DAE feel sudden urges to break up with your SO in an argument?,449,j20bkh,70,I constantly feel uncontrollable urges to break up with my boyfriend in the middle of silly arguments sometimes. I feel like my gut is telling me to leave him before he decides I'm not worth the effort to be with anymore. I've done this in every relationship and I want to stop it.
DAE get massively triggered by people yelling?,451,icky96,57,"I get badly triggered by people yelling, even when it's not at me.  
Just now, I went on Discord to talk to friends (including my FP) who were playing an online game.  
Ingame they were yelling at their teammates ""For f\*cks sake, push!"".

I left the chat again, because that honestly triggers me so badly. People don't really have to yell, just their tilting or whining about their teammates triggers me badly.

How do you deal with this? It even happens when I hear my FP's parents argue in the background.  
It also happens when I hear cars honk at each other. It just makes me angry."
DAE find it really hard to not think of people or things to obsess about when listening to music?,454,kb1bx1,65,"I’ve always had this problem and before I considered the fact that I might have BPD, it was really hard and confusing to understand. For Any song that includes lyrics about love, relationships, or anything like that, I always must find someone to put in place of those lyrics and end up romanticising a whole scenario with them. It’s really difficult though because even when I just want to enjoy a song, it makes it really hard to not relapse if I’m trying to get over someone that I’ve recently had an obsession about. I always make up scenarios in my head like this and I know it’s a common trait of BPD to do so but I haven’t seen many people talk about how hard it is to not create scenarios when listening to music. It’s impossible for me to not do it but it just feels so good and when I don’t, I feel extremely depressed. Anyone else?"
Does anyone else delete things constantly?,449,jz3d1i,89,That's how I am with almost every form of social media. I delete about 80% of anything I ever say. And in any messaging apps like WhatsApp or Discord I end up deleting messages too.
Just had the best breakup ever and i feel so happy..,449,jhuuuk,31,Ok this sounds a bit weird. But me and my girlfriend just broke up it wasnt a very long relationship i would say we first met in January. But today we went for a walk openly discussed our feelings while holding hands decided we both want different things. Hugged it out and went our seperate ways. After 33 years alive this was the first time i ever felt empowered and didn't let my emotions ruin my life during a situation like this. Just sharing. Have a good day
does anyone else feel super easily threatened and insecure??,448,j5q250,63,"i already know the answer to this is yes, but i mean to an extreme extent. for example, if i even hear my bf talking about an ex of his, talking about any girl, or when a new person enters our lives, i get extremely nervous. ill feel my entire self like.. deflate and get really sad and closed off and eventually this turns into being kind of annoyed and wanting to be distant and passive aggressive.
i can’t tell if this is like way too irrational for me to feel so emotional over such small things, but i cant help it."
DAE feel like they can’t articulate themselves accurately while speaking?,452,f3gzvk,65,"So I recently got diagnosed with BPD after getting an initial diagnosis of depression and anxiety a year ago, I found this sub and thought I’d share this here. I’m not sure if this is affiliated with BPD or not but I’ve noticed it’s really hard for me to express myself clearly and say what I mean in verbal context. I’ll have something I want to say in my head it’ll be clear to me but once I’m actually trying to vocalize these thoughts it’s just like verbal diarrhoea. I don’t know if I’m overthinking this, close friends and family have spent so much time with me that (I think?) they understand the points I’m trying to make, but I always feel like I’m not able to actually accurately communicate how I feel. It’s really frustrating because I hear people speak effectively around me all the time and it just makes me overly conscious about my own speaking abilities which just makes me spiral even more. Texting has always been my preferred way of communicating cause I feel like writing things down gives me the chance to review what I’m saying and fine tune it to accurately convey what’s going on in my head."
Do you interpret any mood someone else is in to must have been caused by you?,452,awlywq,32,"I just realized this very recently about myself. In every interaction I have, I find it very difficult to separate myself from their mood and behavior.

If I walk into a room and someone doesn't say hello back to me in a happy tone, I assume they are angry at me, ignoring me, trying to get a reaction from me, etc. When in reality they might not be paying attention, busy working on something, might have gotten some bad news that had nothing to do with me. 

Are there some strategies that might help me not jump to extreme conclusions that someone hates me from what objectively could be a very a neutral interaction? I want to try to be more rational in how I interpret other people's actions because it's caused a lot of problems for me in the past."
Does anybody else get fairly easily moved to tears by music?,445,av8buv,85,"I'll be listening to a song and if I resonate with it, there's a nice chance I'll start tearing up."
The single most infuriating thing to hear.,447,aqyvvi,87,"""Everybody feels like that sometimes.""

No, not everybody has a mental illness.  Saying that, regardless of intent, falls in line with 'we all have a little (disorder).'  It's invalidating and minimizes our struggles.  I wish professionals in particular would stop acting like this statement is something helpful."
"DAE feels disconnected with the ""you"" from the past?",450,i1ofe2,43,"And I mean, really early past. Like 1/2 months ago. 

I'm used to get cringey at the me from the past because, well, we change, that's for sure and it's fine, but by ""disconnected"" I mean that you feel you were a completely different person, doesn't remember a lot of things you did and WHY you did, you feel guilty and stupid, you simply can't understand how you portrayed the way you did. TBH it's starting to make me feel anxious and giving me agony, living and knowing that I will be a completely different person after two months? I already struggle with loving myself, and this too?!?! How am I supposed to cope with this when I'm always embarrassed and disappointed with myself? Seems like I'm a robot who can't feel anything, and are just living because you don't have another option. I'm sorry about the rant, but this disorder is making me crazy."
My friend lost her fight with BPD last night.,448,grwujo,43,She was such a kind loving soul.. I wish I could have done more to keep her here. I know the battle she was fighting all too well. I can't help but feel guilt for not reaching out to her more.. being someone who battles this illness as well. I guess just looking for some positive vibes sent my way because my heart is broken right now..
We should have a gift exchange where we trade weird things we bought on impulse,447,9k9hs1,317,
"Instagram/Social Media ""Self Help"" is the most toxic thing for BPD",446,hpsz6q,58,"""Motivational"" accounts, Quote accounts, spiritual ""gurus""...I really have come to dislike these people strongly. Yes, social media *in general* is pretty bad for BPD, but these people specifically are the worst. Masquerading as thought leaders and giving out hollow advice that, for a lot of people, replaces therapy. What's worse is that for people who don't have mental health issues, they adopt these ""solutions"" as life mantras that can overcome anything, without realising it's only surface level and without ever addressing the problem at its core.

For the longest time before my diagnosis, it made me believe that I *needed* to think and be the kind of person these posts portrayed, and that because I wasn't able to achieve that, it made me a failure. I thought that if I ""raised my vibrations"" eventually I would become better.

I strongly believe that everyone in this world could benefit from therapy, Instagram posts have normalised, and even idealised depression and mental health, and it really irks me.

Self-help at its core isn't a bad thing, and I want to make a topic about ""The Power of Now"" at some point as I am reading through it, but so much of it can be toxic, especially when it's served in bite-size ""post"" format."
"Every person I've ever dated in the beginning: Wow for a person with a ""personality disorder"" you really don't have any problems, you're great!",445,euce76,77,Every person I've ever dated by the end: You have serious mental problems and I'm leaving you. Get some help.
DAE feel like their partner deserves better and you cannot genuinely be a good partner? I find that the paranoia and lack of confidence is detrimental to having a healthy relationship.,445,ha7lwz,51,"
I am flooded with thoughts and emotions about how my partner would be happier with someone who is more mentally stable and generally more upbeat. I am often irritable, withdrawn, and overwhelmed. I tell them I am not feeling and behaving in a way I would want my partner to. They say they want to be with me and my fears of being too much are not true. I just cannot believe they couldn’t be happier with someone else and it makes me feel terrible, like I’m holding them back."
"Does anyone else always accept sex when offered, even if you don’t actually want it at the moment?",445,asefad,111,"There will be times where my boyfriend will ask to have sex and even if I’m not in the mood, or I don’t want to at that moment I’ll still say yes anyways. Part of it is because I know the dopamine rush will most likely help me, but also because I feel like if I don’t then it will make my boyfriend no longer like me, or cause him to want to cheat. He’s never done anything to make me think this, but I feel like my BPD causes me to overreact. "
I feel like I’m playing victim when I open up about how I’m doing,442,iyqh8t,28,"I literally don’t know what to do, I completely admit in the past I’ve claimed to be a victim but I was very young and had no idea what I was doing. I didn’t realize how bad I was hurting people and myself. 
Now being much more aware it’s almost like I work so hard not to seem like I’m playing victim that I just refuse to open up to people.
If that makes any sense? 

Like I’ve been having a really hard time with drinking and being out of work, I’ve spent most of my days by myself and not leaving my room at all. I’m in a really bad place and I have no idea how to get out of this but every time I talk to anyone about it I immediately regret it because I know they can’t do anything and I know it’s really old to hear the same story. I feel like I’m portraying myself as a victim when I’m obviously not, I’m just trying to explain what’s going on. 

I’m so lost."
Does anyone else impulsively text people rants then immediately regret it?,445,icdcpw,62,"Sometimes I text people, who I consider acquaintances at the very least, long rants about something that happened to me that makes me feel panicky. I have an urge to just tell someone about the problem and let out all my anxiety into text message. As soon as I’m done ranting, I feel extremely stupid and regretful for doing it. Especially when that person leaves me on read. I hate that I do this but I never stop. People have been annoyed with me in the past about this issue, but I still do it without thinking. The only way I can prevent myself from ranting or texting something I’ll regret is by either hating them or by blocking them. Idk how to change. Today I made a long rant to my sisters friend about how I am anxious bc my teacher didn’t respond when I asked them for a rec for college. I feel like a shitty person because her dog died a few days ago."
Being on good behavior feels so.....boring.,440,hn9jvz,65,"I’m working on not having bad impulses to shop, overeat, drink, get drunk and do stupid things etc but I feel guilty for feeling like normalicy is fucking Boring as hell...

Like tonight I would usually get a Taco Bell box, drink a shit load of wine, order sex toys on wish and jam out to music but instead I’m going to bed at 9 pm. And I’m just sitting here feeling so fucking bored. Like I feel like bpd brings excitement into my life. Even though it isn’t real. 

It distracts me from my pitiful existence...or at least until the stress of tomorrow"
BPD and relationships,446,cvq5ho,63,"I find it fairly easy to attract partners. My BPD and eagerness to please means I know how to be everything they've ever wanted. I also know how to come across as just available enough but not too needy at first. I can be exciting and different and my lack of impulse control definitely ramps up the excitement. In the beginning of the relationship I'm highly sexual. 

But once we really know each other I become frustrated that whilst I'm becoming their dream girl, they aren't doing the same for me. And every time they do something that displeases me I feel rejected and terrified they're going to leave me. I distance myself, swinging between super needy and demanding, and really cold. 
If they are emotionally unavailable I want them more because of the fear of abandonment and I want to change them to love me. 
But if they're emotionally available and love me despite my issues, and don't argue then I become terrified that I'm going to be engulfed by them. The intimacy and real vulnerability is awful and I become distant and absolutely cannot stand being touched or loved or any sexual contact whatsoever and I end it. 

I **need** the push and pull. I **need** the drama. I have such a messed up relationship with sex and love that I cannot fathom ever having a normal relationship. 


I also swing between fully gay and bisexual. I have no clue what I am, who I am, what I want etc. 

And it's so fucking tiring."
Feeling like a kid or teenager stuck in an adult body.,441,ch8umt,99,"Not like ""young at heart"", jumping on the bed when no one is watching, I'm talking more about feeling behind, like you're not where you're supposed to be. I know this might not make sense. 


Anyone here picking up what I'm putting down?



Edit: I've been feeling this way for so long, it's a little overwhelming reading these replies. Thank you all for letting me know I'm not alone."
Me and my partner will be celebrating our 3 year anniversary this week!,443,mfkjmv,46,"During the process of getting diagnosed I kept getting told that people with BPD don't usually have long term, meaningful relationships. Every time I'd say I have a boyfriend (together for 6 months at that point), the professionals would be skeptical, almost like I've made him up, or they'd say I need to leave him until I get better so I don't hurt him while I heal.

Well today, 5 weeks away from finishing DBT, we're celebrating our 3 year anniversary this Thursday. We have huge plans for the future, later this year we're hoping to be moving in together full time. We talk about marriage and weddings and kids all the time, we pretend fight over our possible last names and what we're gonna name the kids. We talk about giving my bird the best life and our future adopted pets. I've never had such in-depth conversations with anyone else about kitchen and bathroom layouts, we spent months deciding which knife set to buy.

I've never had someone accept me as me but also celebrate and acknowledge the changes and progress I've made. He doesn't see me as old me vs new me, he sees me with better skills. Even with me being non-binary and getting a binder this year, he still sees me. When I find a new hobby or interest, he listens to me rant about it with a smile on his face. He even looks at all the pictures of frogs I show him and he hates frogs.

It is possible for people with BPD to have healthy and strong relationships.

Edited to add: If someone makes a happy post, please don't shit on it by derailing the conversation to the treatment of men in mental health. If you're tired of seeing women told stories, tell your own and contribute to the class instead of complaining about the lack of men's perspectives."
DAE remember every single negative comment made about them?,444,j6xzbq,45,It's honestly exhausting but my brain remembers every bad thing anyone's ever said to me. Even as a joke. I keep that so close to me and I'll have flashbacks all the time. Makes me never want to speak or honestly really exist around other people. Guess it's just stupid.
Does anyone else get extreme fear of rejection posting anything online?,438,cg907q,40,"I have to create a burner account every time I post because I'm scared people outside this sub will go through my post history and judge me. On bad days, a downvote will send me into a spiral, and God forbid I get a negative comment. I feel crazy-- it took me fifteen minutes to read through this post over and over and over just in case there's content that someone could get mad at me for. I don't know if this is social anxiety or my bpd or something else but I don't like it."
CW: my boyfriend died today,443,c9andn,93,"this morning my (28 F) boyfriend (29 M) died in my arms. he was not feeling well the last few days and admitted last night that he was withdrawing from alcohol. he was jaundiced, but did not want to go to the hospital. he was not sleeping well overnight and was physically very restless. around 6:30am he went to take a shower but he was feeling weak so I told him to make sure he was sitting down in the shower. he was taking longer than usual, so I went to check on him and found him sitting on the edge of the tub, dripping wet and delirious. he was not making sense and saying things like “you were in the shower?” etc. I had to physically dry him off and walk him back to bed. once back in his bed, he was breathing very fast, almost panting. I told him we should go to the hospital and began to dress him and he said “I don’t deserve you.” he then had a seizure for about 30 seconds and was unresponsive with no pulse or breathing. his roommate began administering CPR while EMT’s were on their way. they worked on him for about 20 minutes before telling us there was nothing they could do. his body laid on his bedroom floor for about an hour, I was able to sit with him and hold his hand and tell him how sorry I was this was happening. police came and carried him away in a bag. he is being examined tomorrow. I will never feel his love or hold his hand or giggle with him again. my heart is broken.


I just needed to write this out. thank you all."
DAE hate the term “high-functioning BPD”,448,bbibc6,71,"So I have “quiet” BPD, which I’ve heard used interchangeably with “high-functioning” BPD. But I absolutely cannot stand the term “high-functioning”. To me it feels like an invalidation of my daily struggles. 

Sure, I get up, I go to class, I have a 4.0, I have a job. I’m doing just fine on the outside. But in reality, I’m constantly battling suicidal thoughts, the shocks of emotional highs and lows throughout the day leave me drained, the reason I do well in work/school is because I have no concept of who I am or my worth unless someone is giving me an A or an award or saying “good job”, I question whether my boyfriend is gonna leave me every single day. 

I’m not high-functioning, I’m just suffering quietly. 

Does anyone else feel this way?"
My BF/FP had a talk with me about boundaries a few days ago. It was one of the hardest talks we’ve ever had.,439,lfkvvv,35,"I wanted to share my experience because maybe others can relate, or maybe perhaps others might need to hear some of this so they can apply it to their own situation.

He literally spends about 75% of his day with me most days, and yet I’ll get upset and in my head trying to chase after that additional 25%. I always felt like if I didn’t get 100% that means he must not really love me or that I’m at risk of losing him. Truth is, he’s been putting those boundaries in place to protect the relationship because I’m not always easy to handle. 

I learned he doesn’t like telling me things like what he’s doing or even when he woke up because he knows I’ll be upset that he isn’t with me, and overthink the reason why he wanted time to himself. 

I learned when he’s passive and dismissive of my feelings it’s not because he’s being a jerk and doesn’t care about them but when I’m having a moment and at a 100, there’s no talking to me. He just goes about and does his own thing, not because he hates me or is about to leave me, but because he loves me enough to not want to end up hating me. 

I actually heard him say that even when I am being difficult and he may not be reassuring and tell me what he knows I want to hear, I don’t have to stress because his feelings don’t just disappear in those moments. 

This is perhaps the most communicative he’s ever been with me. It was a hard pill to swallow, as I didn’t think I was that bad but when he finally opened up, I realized just how overbearing I am, how high and unrealistic my expectations are, that he does love and care for me and that’s exactly why he has boundaries up. However, it made me see that: even though I’m getting better, I still have a long way to go.

Now problem is remaining mindful of all this in critical moments, or still believing in his words next time I split.

One year since I last self harmed!,442,jkeusu,27,It's a new way to look at my scars now I guess. The last time I self harmed I also admitted myself to the emergency and stayed overnight. What a difference time makes.
DAE pick up personality traits from movie characters and can’t help themselves?,436,gdadnp,110,"I’ve been doing this since I was 7.  I would start out by thinking “wow, I like that character!” or “I don’t like that character!” and then pick up the characteristics that make them them and it would stick for not even a week. I would do this with EVERY character I liked. For example, rn I’m stuck with Pam Beesly from The Office and it’s been a little over 2 weeks bc Ive been binge watching it again. I would unintentionally pick things up from her like the way she speaks, mannerisms, think....sometimes I can’t help myself. It’s not extreme, but I would say 30% of me is now Pam Beesly. Is this part of the identity issue??



EDIT: even though i was typing this and feeling pretty sad about it, yalls lighthearted comments have actually brighten my mood. Thank you for the positive energy.

EDIT: wow didn’t expect to get as many comments as I did! I won’t be able to reply to all, but I’m glad I got to put some mind at ease for the people who were worried they might have autism. And thank you guys for commenting your thoughts!! I’ll definitely read them all :)"
A HUGE SUCCESS STORY!!,441,gic6ys,52,"This is possibly my biggest success in YEARS when it comes to self-love and I still can't believe it myself, even though I'm about to go to bed.
Today I'm 22 and for the first time since I was 12, I've properly celebrated my birthday. No crying. No wishing I was dead. No dread about the future. Just being in the moment, for the first time in a long time.
Six months ago, I'd planned to die before my 22nd. But I'm still here, and today was so full of love surrounded by my friends and family because I was so full of love. 
I even made a video thanking everyone showing my face AND spontaneously speaking a second language! This is completely unheard of!! 
Even if I wake up depressed tomorrow, I feel like I can hold on by reliving the memories of today.
This is my favorite birthday yet.
I survived.

Edit: Thank you so much for ur well wishes!! Screen shotting each and every one of them as I speak! I hope my story inspires all of you and as family we're all in this together x Tysm guys, I love you!! 💕

Edit: Gold?? I shed a tear x emotions too much rn, in a really, really good way <3 I'm so fucking glad I'm here x you're all so beautiful xx"
DAE feel like they are the least important person in everyone elses life?,441,atoott,64,I always feel like I'm like the last person anyone would ever talk to and they only talk to me when they have no one else to chat with
I hate being ignored,439,ibceoc,65,"There is nothing worse you could to do me than ignore me. Genuinely. If you killed my family I wouldn’t be as upset. When I talk about something and people ignore me I have a breakdown and want to slit my throat. It’s not funny. It’s serious. 

Even if I said something weird or wrong, please say something. Call me out, call me names, do whatever, just please don’t ignore me. Please. 

How can I be convinced people want me around when they say “I love you, you’re an amazing friend” and then ignore me when I merely say I’m depressed? Ignore me when I simply share something? Why?

It’s even worse when you say something in a group chat, no one responds, you delete it and then everyone starts talking. Or when I delete it, be upset about people ignoring me and then they respond to my initial message even though it’s deleted? 

Please. Just don’t ignore me. I’m begging you. Please. Call me annoying, stupid, fucked up, mentally ill, I don’t know what. I’d appreciate it more than being ignored. 

I guess these are just the consequences of not getting enough attention as a child.

edit: Why do I get downvoted every single fucking time I post here?"
GUYS I GOT A SUPER COOL JOB!!!,444,d39zkr,42,"I was walking in the city and passed by a really cool-looking café, and I just decided to set my fears aside and go apply. I got the job right then and there, and I have a practice shift tomorrow already! Sometimes those spontaneous bursts of confidence really do get us places!! If you want something, just GO FOR IT. As cheesy as it sounds, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take :)"
Apparently nightmares occur chronically in 49% of people with BPD.,438,jm9myv,123,"I have BPD and I have nightmares 3-4 times a week. If I'm lucky, my husband is awake and hears me trying to scream and wakes me up. Usually they involve dark rooms, evil feelings, demons and telekinesis. DAE suffer with chronic frequent nightmares?"
If people are ill-equipped to deal with your emotions that does NOT mean they don't like you as a person,439,iofr7g,22,"Most people don't have the emotional capacity of a trained therapist. Many feel helpless and overwhelmed when faced with our emotions, our stories and struggles. Some will act defensive or even mean about it. But many try to connect to us, verbally or non-verbally, even in casual ways like you do with every person you meet, and they sense the mountain of grief within us and they simply can't deal with it. It makes them afraid for themselves, and it makes them afraid for us, and many freeze or withdraw. But that does NOT mean they don't like us as a person. It just means they themselves feel helpless, just like we do."
"As a guy with BPD, I've never felt more alone...",438,h9xy9j,122,"I've never met a single guy who's suffered like I have. Always thought I was weak & overly sensitive, trying to overcompensate by acting ""thug"" & ""cold.""

Honestly, I look like a masculine man, but I still have all the symptoms - from the idealization/devaluation cycle to the constant need to be reassured that I'm enough. This used to amplify my shame, like wow... I'm the biggest pussy on the planet.

Hence, a lot of my friends told me that they initially thought I was **gay**. Not because of my appearance or mannerisms, but because I always seemed ""too nice"" instead of the cold demeanor other guys can have

The hardest part, though, is that society generally doesn't feel bad for me. I'm not a girl. I don't get a regular stream of attention. I've never felt emotionally protected because men are expected to protect. Everything about me just goes against the grain & I really feel the friction.

My mother is the only 1 who reminds me that my kindness & sensitivity is a gift, & I've learned to embrace myself for just how much I care about others.

If you ever wonder what it's like to be a guy who feels alienated from the world around him, I recommend watching Moonlight (or even Joker). That ending scene  where Chiron admits to never being held again tears me up.

Anyway, rant over. Maybe somebody will read this & feel less alone. Living with BPD feels like playing life on hard mode, but if anything, it made me a stronger player."

I fell in love with a girl with BPD,436,anv5z4,89,"And I think she's amazing. I wish she could see what I see. It sucks to see her sad. I just wanna take away all that pain. Her cuddles are perfect. I'm so glad I met her.  She's so caring, considerate, we get on extremely well. I wanna do the best I can by her.

Keep fighting the fight. As far as I'm concerned, you're all amazing and should be proud.
I'm proud of her.

Any tips for a guy who just wants to give her the best when her condition acts up? I'm all ears.

Thanks for reading. Just felt like sharing, really.

Is it a BPD thing to crush on someone if they are nice and losing interest the moment they show real interest?,435,j0v8sl,52,"I know you are all not qualified to say if something is a bpd symptom but maybe someone has bpd and knows this is caused because of their bpd, if you know what I mean? I have diagnosed bpd.

So everytime someone is nice to me I Interpret it as them having interest in me romantically. Even if I didn't had the attraction before now I have it.

I do everything to gain their attention and flirt with them. I will want to be with them all of the time. If I meet with friends and they will come, I am really giddy and happy and can't wait to see them. 
This goes on until I realize, that it isn't my fantasy anymore, they have real romantic interest. I panic and realize I didn't find them attractive AT ALL. How could I feel such a thing, they weren't even my type? Or I still find them objectively attractive but have no crush anymore/ or find some flaw and stop crushing over them.


I've come to a point were I don't know if I have genuine interest or wether it's just this bullshit again. I don't want to waste their time and end up breaking someones heart because I change my mind so frequently.

Does anyone of you recognize this? Have you found a solution to this?"
ghosted on my bday :/,440,ie0pjl,113,"today is my 18th bday and i was supposed to go out to lunch w one of my good friends but she isn’t responding :( so i asked in a group chat w a lot of my friends if anyone wanted to go get food but no one responded. now i feel pathetic bc i posted it on my snapchat story too i’m basically having to beg for someone to come celebrate my bday w me and i feel like a piece of shit. i always get really really sad on my birthdays and it makes me feel pathetic. 

sorry for the rant i just wanted to vent & felt like this sub would understand the most ig :/

edit: i’m sorry i haven’t really responded to any comments if i’m being honest i haven’t really known what to say bc i’ve been all over the place today but i just wanted to say that i really appreciate every single one of you and it means a lot to me that y’all don’t even know me but care. sending u all lots of love <3"
You guys my room is clean!! For the first time in months!!!,431,eoe82j,37,"It took me all weekend and part of today but everything is in its place again and it feels so amazing!! I'm the type of person where my mood is reflected in my space... My space was terrible. 

I also bought veggies for the first time in ages so I can stop with take out and I've been meditating again for nearly a week.

This is a far cry from last week (look in my post hx if you dare lol) and I just feel so much lighter 😭

"DAE sink into a depressive episode when someone says they can't hang out, even if their reason it perfectly valid and logical?",434,enoex6,31,"See title.

I often am hesitant to reach out and make plans for the fear of being rejected, and when I do reach out and am rejected, I immediately think they hate me and their feelings have changed towards me."
"I am fully convinced I have nobody I can truly confide in so whenever I have an opportunity to share, I overshare like an idiot.",437,dfu5kc,38,"Basically none of my friends are comfortable with me venting to them and it just hurts. I hate how I get like this and I hate that it feels like nobody cares. I want people to care, I want to feel like I matter but I don't despite how hard I try to be positive. Instead I pour my heart out to anyone and everyone because I'm weak and that scares people away. I hate that I'm crying right now because my GF is being moody and needs some space. I hate that I have no control over anything. I feel useless and unwanted, a mistake that should have never happened. 

Even my parents regret me and don't know what to do to help me. I just want to close my eyes tonight and drift away. I'm so damn tired of this. 

I hate the flip flop of emotions, how my FP can make me dance like a puppet, how one minute I'm with them and I'm content with life and actually am looking forward to the future to me curling in bed, dry crying and wanting to be dead because she wants a single night alone.

And I hate that I'm self aware of all this, I just want to accept what's going on. I want to accept that I'm not in control that things happen. But I can't. Instead I throw a fit and cry."
Quit drinking and I've been alcohol free for 6 months!,438,cihldk,66,"Edit: I was too nervous to put that it's also been 6 months since my last attempt on my life. So proud of myself for getting this far and if anyone wants to talk, please feel free to message me. 

Edit: Wow, I got my first gold! Thank you so much for the love anonymous friend!"
Is anyone else SO self aware it hurts?,435,bulrrr,50,"I can identify my BPD behaviour about 70% of the time, when I'm in a good place. I still have all the thoughts and do crazy shit around my favourite person, but I have the ability to moderate it a bit. When I'm 'okay' I can describe my thoughts and feelings which are not normal. Of course, when I have a bad day or episode, I can't, but I can look back and think 'that's where you went wrong.' Sometimes it's good, but when you are so self aware that you KNOW you are acting like a crazy person but do so anyway, it kills me inside. Then there's the feelings of shame, of knowing I did something I shouldn't have done. Of knowing I acted out, hurt someone yet again. The clarity I have, being able to identify the fine line between 'me' and BPD hurts me inside because it's like watching a bomb go off, knowing the bomb is going off, and standing next to it, not able to stop the detonation."
I'm never going to be anybody's One True Love™,435,l8lvnr,75,"See, they're always *really* into me at first. Obsessed. Latching on to everything I give out. I'm interesting and funny and quirky. Mysterious too. And they're just entirely charmed. And then like bubblegum, the flavor must eventually wear off. They'll condemn me for the same illness they were actively & knowingly feeding into. I go in their eyes from a glittering godling to frustrating flake.

Every time.

I can never be the one for anybody. How I might be feeling about them ultimately doesn't matter. I'm just a stepping stone between one thing & another. They never want to be friends after my illness stops being cool. I'm the weird alien they might think about every now & then, but that they'll never want to return to. 

The one that was never gonna be anything more than an attractive stranger. 

And I did warn them. 

Every time.

**Edit**: This isn't about whether or not some kinda magical, unending romantic love actually exists, or about how many times somebody told me they love me. This is about *my* BPD experience in regards to romantic relationships, one that's been repeating for the last 14 or so years. I've been in brief relationships and I've been in longer relationships. I was married once.

My brain isn't really at its best today, so the only other thing I have to say is **thanks / sorry / you're welcome**."
I FEEL AMAZING.,432,epldwt,54,"Only with BPD can you attempt suicide and then feel euphoric a day later. Lmao. Please don’t shit on me, I’ve not had a good mood swing in ages!! 💖"
DAE not ever want to have children so that they don't raise a broken person?,436,8uyese,95,
I did the dishes.,434,mdt89c,38,"My sink has been full of dishes for like three months, I just couldn't get myself to do it. Recently my boyfriend broke up with me. I've been pretty badly in shambles, many of my dishes need to be thrown away, but I did them goddammit.

"I recently found out my coworker also has BPD, and it made me realize something.",434,a6n7am,22,"My coworker told me that she has BPD, and it made me think about how everyone talks about her when she’s not listening. 

Everyone loves her. They say she’s beautiful, bubbly, and has an infectious laugh. They don’t see any of the insecurities she sees in herself. 

So, I guess what I’m saying is that this has given me a new perspective on how we are seen in society, and that it’s not 100% negative. "
Find it hard to take care of themselves unless you feel like fp cares about you?,434,kw0pr2,97,"I don't know if this makes much sense but I've been struggling with depression for a while now and I find it hard to take care of myself, to purposefully chose things that I know are for my own good (sometimes I skip meals or don't eat for days, don't shower, don't do uni work etc) when I'm in a fight with fp or when I feel like they don't care about me as much. When we are on good terms and in my eyes they're the best person on the planet, I really feel motivated to take very good care of myself and be my best.
I know cognitively that this is messed up but oftentimes it's just out of my control. It's like whats the point if he doesn't love me, might as well just wither away.

Edit: This got more attention than I'm comfortable with. Just to expand, I wasn't posting this looking for advice, because I know what's the ""right"" way to think and do. I posted this to have people relate so I could feel less alone and telling me how no one will love me more than myself and how I'm an adult is the opposite of helping me. I just want to feel seen and not judged, to accept myself and this dumb disorder that I have and eventually move past it.
To the people suggesting how I should take small steps to feel better or how I should do something for me, I feel like aren't really getting the point here. I don't want to do something for me because I don't want to feel better. And the only thing that makes me want to feel better is my FP and they're the only reason I have motivation to do things in life, because I know they love me. And would ne sad if I'm not taking care of myself or worse. Telling me I should find it within myself won't help me, because duh, I know, I just can't and I just don't want to at the moment. I childishly want someone to care about me so I could take care of myself. To add that I can function well most of the time, I just have these moments whenever we're in a fight or get triggered by the slight change of the way they're acting towards me.
Also to add that therapy is currently out of the option. That's why I'm on here to try to relate to people to see how I'm not just some freak who deserves to die because I have all of these symptoms, so I could find it in myself to forgive myself and only then find motivation to do something about my problems. Currently the biggest thing I can do for myself is accept myself and do no harm. Actually bettering myself will come one day, but right now, that is too much.
Thanks for contributing."
Does anyone else find it extremely difficult to pay attention to someone else talking?,431,kv7zlm,58,"Listening to people talk, 98% of the time, feels like a chore. I almost always am just waiting for them to stop talking and for the conversation to end. I should note I also have ADHD, but is this also common for BPD? My mom, for example (who I love more than anything) loves to talk and is always passionate about some topic. The mental effort it takes to stay focused and “interested” in the topic is just too exhausting and I have so much going on in my own head that I can’t focus on when I have to listen to others. Often I just snap at her and tell her I can’t listen anymore because I just get angrier and angrier as I try to listen for an extended period of time. Afterwards I feel guilty but in the moment I just can’t help it."
The BPD feel when...,428,inlvuo,30,"... someone talks about a loving and caring family member of theirs and you totally die inside of jealousy but you stand up straight, smile, and act like you‘re absolutely enjoying the story. Show must always go on, amirite?"
The person who replaced me at my old job quit after less than 8 weeks,431,d8rkqf,72,"She couldn’t take on all the responsibilities I was balancing. I was in this job for 3 years and it was incredibly high stress and high pressure. I cried a lot. I thought it was my BPD reducing my ability to cope. But this shows that sometimes we’re not just overreacting. Actually, some of us can probably deal with volatile situations quite well considering we’ve navigated them for most of our lives. Make sure you are not putting up with something that is feeding into creating more negative environments, trust your gut. Sometimes how you’re feeling is actually just completely justifiable.

Edit: Thank you everyone for the support, totally unexpected. This is why I love the BPD community, we all lift each other up. You are all amazing. 💛"
I lost a good friend this year who was recently diagnosed with BPD. Please read.,430,97zl1x,56,"She could light up a room. Anything she put her mind to she excelled at. She cared for others deeply and wanted everyone to get along. Unfortunately....life for her seemed to become black and white. She couldn't see the grey area. The area where there are people who loved her despite her illness.

She disassociated. She split. She laughed. She cried. She raged. She loved. She understood others when people could never understand the pain she was in. 

She went to the hospital. Finally got diagnosed with BPD. Confinded in me about how scared she was to get the diagnosis.

""They told me it's stigmatized and not a diagnosis they like giving out.""

She struggled. She reached out. She tried. She really did. Then....she ended her life.

We were supposed to go hiking that Thursday... We talked the night before you finally ran so far away I couldn't find you anymore. You didn't mention how bad it was. I was just happy you were my friend and I was yours despite your intense and wild splitting. You were an angel. I guess heaven needed their angel back.

You were gone the next day. You had ended the pain. No more dissociation, no more wild mood swings, no more smiles, no more love pouring from your heart. You loved others so much. They never accepted you. It split you in two. 

I never judged you for your illness. It didn't define you. I miss you. I love you dearly friend.

Please, if you have a loved one struggling with their diagnosis please reach out to them. They aren't bad people...they aren't crazy...they aren't serial abusers....they're people. They are hurting. 

Much love to you all. Please, don't give in. There's a lot of us out there that know you are worthy of self love and actualization. I'm sorry your life and how you are wired seemed to steal that from you. 

You.are.a.whole.person.
You're just discovering all the pieces still.

It’s my birthday,433,lw47r5,60,"I turn 20 today. When I was growing up, I never thought I would make it to see my 20’s but here I am. I’m no longer a teenager, today I am officially a young adult! 😊"
Have you reached a point in your life where you prefer to stay away from romantic relationship at all cost?,429,lmogxp,86,"I spent most of my 20's trying to regulate my poor self esteem through my relationships with women. The more I felt loved, the more I felt accepted and significant but ultimately that made me a codependent person and a slave to my partners. 

And eventually, the relationship would turn to shit as I needed more love and sacrifice from them in order to feel secure and happy. If they didn't satisfy me, I would get triggered and reacted badly. In other words, I was an emotionally abusive person without truly realizing it. 

Last year, as I became more and more self conscious about the way I function, I began to realize how unproductive and unhealthy it was for me and for my potential partner to be in a relationship and since then, I have just turned cold and want no part of it."
DAE love to be alone but are also terrified of being alone?,432,k8qwnx,63,"I’m really trying to understand myself here... I love to be alone, I think it’s exhausting to be with people. But I also love it, I crave closer relationships and connections and want to be social and I thrive when I’m out drinking with friends or hanging out with friends but it’s also so exhausting... So sometimes I want to be alone but I’m terrified of actually being alone. I want people to text me, snap me, show me they are in my life without me actually having to hang out with them all the time?

I am a very dependant person but I also need more alone time than the people around me seem to need?"
"Does anyone get the desire to kiss someone after they’ve been nice to you, or enter within proximity to your interpersonal space?",433,jcvq3l,45,"It’s a very strange thing that happens to me, that I’m very afraid to talk about with anyone, but any person, regardless of my sexuality, and sexual attraction to that person, I get a thought that I’ve never acted on unless I was in a sexual relationship with that person. 

It’s happened with my friends, and sometimes family members after they’ve been nice to me. (I do have a tendency to try and reward people physically when they’re nice to me.) 

Is this a trait common with BPD, or is this something separate stemming from other trauma?"
Obsess over things just to abandon it the moment I get it.,433,j1fpre,56,"&#x200B;

I tend to obsess over something I want to the point it may be considered unhealthy. For example I was really hooked on getting my new phone but the moment it arrived I lost all interest in it. .I will desperately try to get something be it a normal thing like a new shirt I want. I order them, wait desperately for the delivery thinking about how I’ll look in it, how good is the material quality, how it will fit me, what pants or other clothes will suit It the best, how will my friends react to it, should I wear it on a regular day or save it for a special day, etc. but the day the shirt is delivered I wear it once and then it ends up in a corner in my wardrobe. It happens not only with material things but also in relationships. I obsess about a person, I go above and beyond to earn their attention and be my friend but the minute they try getting close to me or open up to me I lose all interest in them and run away from them avoiding them like they never existed. It’s like I’m always chasing the next high. I obsess about getting something and that’s more euphoric than actually having the thing. I desperately want someone to like me and be with me but when someone tries to come close I shut them down. I think I like the idea of having something rather than actually having it \[If that even makes any sense\]. I want to be happy but every accomplishment I make I end up feeling empty. it’s a cycle I can’t seem to break. Obsess-achieve-abandon-obsess-achieve-abandon."

DAE absolutely HATE repeating themselves?,434,hcuhbj,71,"It drives me nuts and automatically pisses me off when someone asks me to repeat what I've said (even though I know that most of the times they genuinely couldn't hear me, or the connection was bad on the phone, etc) but it's such a trigger for me and it always manages to enrage me and sometimes I get so annoyed that lash out at the person. I know it's crazy and I know all the logical explanations but I just can't help the feeling.

I guess it must come from our issues with feeling invisible and invalidated for most of our lives? Idk."
"I don’t ever get texted first, it’s like a huge invalidation trigger.",431,fuu57l,82,"I don’t know to explain, but it feels as though I’m not thought of or cared about at all. My friends will talk to each other constantly but I never get a message, it’s always me being the first one to text.. and then even then I don’t get a reply for hours to days. I didn’t text FP first, and so I haven’t been messaged even once in 3 days. It’s as if no one would care if I was gone. All I want is a ‘hello’ once in a while, just something."
"DAE feel like they come across as ""weird""?",427,f6s99n,98,"Like, I am a pretty high functional BPD/anxiety sufferer, but sometimes I think I just come across as pretty weird. Sometimes, I cannot comprehend what other people are telling me and I keep misunderstanding, as if we're speaking different languages and I've seen people being quite put off by this.

I also tend to be quite agitated, look around frantically like I am lost if I am not sure where to go, get easily startled, I sometimes start rambling, jumping from one subject to another and just act like I am somewhat out of it. I feel like people are constantly judging me and that I can easily be spotted as ""mentally ill""  if that makes sense, even though otherwise, on paper, I wouldn't be so.. obvious I guess?

I don't exactly get why this is happening and I am wondering if other people with BPD can relate or have any insight.

edit: wow, it's validating and interesting at the same time so many people relate to this!! some people even said it better than I ever could; to answer a few people, I am definitely not autistic, I think my ""awkwardness"" is due to generalized anxiety disorder. Also, even though sometimes (I don't get weird all the time) when talking to strangers coming across as weird is discouraging, I am trying my best to embrace it and I know that the people who are sticking through it with me accept me just the way I am and I hope all you lovely people that go through this find your peace and just accept yourselves as you are, as I am trying to do ♥ I feel like replying ""mood"" to most comments haha"
Raise your hand if you ruined your NYE with an emotional outburst,433,abj6p7,136,*raises hand*
DAE Post on social media platforms only to immediately delete the content a few short moments after?,432,imt6ep,93,"I’m curious to know if anyone else does this? 

I’ll share a “story” on Instagram/FB/etc, or even create an entire post, only to wind up deleting it 5-10 minutes later. I think that I mostly do this because sometimes it feels like I’m not really, or “truthfully”, projecting myself. More importantly; I feel like my thoughts+feelings change so frequently that I can’t seem to ride any type of wave all the way out; too worried about the people I know in real life judging me. 

Me: “This is so me! I relate! I feel!”
Me 10 Minutes Later: “God, people on here probably think I’m so stupid....”

Anyone else? Just me, maybe being atypical about this? How do you interact through social media compared to how you think “normal” people interact?"
Anyone else a BoJack Horseman fan?,426,lix0c6,79,"It feels like I have Beatrice Horseman’s words running through my head. “..you come by it honestly, the ugliness inside you. You were born broken, that's your birthright. And now, you can fill your life with projects, your books, and your movies and your little girlfriends, but it won't make you whole. You're BoJack Horseman. There's no cure for that.” 

That’s how I feel a lot of the time. Like I was born broken. That I have a deep rooted ugliness inside me that I’ll never be able to escape. I know that this disorder can be caused by trauma, and I am definitely aware of the trauma I suffered, but it feels like it was my birthright to be this way. There was never any chance for me."
DAE have an unmanageable obsession with the past,432,jdv0af,46,"for as long as i can really remember, i’ve been extremely emotionally attached to past events. both good memories and bad, but basically i was fixated on people who i don’t talk to anymore and the mistakes i made with them or things they did that hurt me. like, sometimes i’ll think about it all day, even as i’m doing things for my job or talking with friends or whatever. 

sometimes it was a “what could have been” type of yearning and sometimes i would stay angry over years-old conflicts that had been resolved in both parties. 

this has obviously been a big problem in my friendships and relationships because i held terrible grudges over things, because i thought my emotions about them were still relevant in the present. this led to me throwing past events back at people when i was upset (which i’m now aware constitutes manipulation/abuse) and not being able to move forward and feel secure in where i’m at in life. i think this also connects to my self-esteem issues, because i’ll feel that all my worth comes from the damaging situations i’ve been in or caused.

does medication help with this? i was on lexapro for a few years but it kind of plateaued in effectiveness so now i’m not on anything. how do you emotionally disconnect from the past? does DBT help with this?"
DAE fantasize about suicide to feel better?,429,fm12by,51,"i get really depressed and low at night, and sometimes to help me calm down and feel better i'll imagine a really detailed suicide fantasy, like i'll take a bunch of sleeping pills or something, and then i'll imagine everyone's reactions, how i'll be missed and my friends will be miserable, etc, and it's always super idealized. it makes me feel so fucking weird and guilty that i'm actively imagining dying to comfort myself, especially knowing how many people actually do die from suicide...is this common at all"
I'd rather die than work full time,429,mi18iu,83,"Right now I am only working 2 days a week and can barely handle it but in the summer I'm supposed to work full time. I fucking dread it. I hate this fucking shit and it is even worse having to work next to a bitch co-worker. Her in a bad mood and being aggressive makes me feel like shit too. I absorb the energy like a sponge, like wtf. It's fucking hell. Then I'm anxious and shit because of her and about to spiral into a mental breakdown. I can't deal with this shit. I'm so fucking over it"
Borderline personality disorder has strongest link to childhood trauma,428,e2h28v,99,
"DAE have a fear of their partner meeting someone and having an instant ""spark""/soulmate feeling and leave you for them?",426,dokywu,89,"Like what if your partner ran into this someone and they just instantly had amazing chemistry and its ""love at first sight"" type of deal. And that person felt like their true soulmate? What if they run into this person and they experienced a more intense more emotional feeling with them than they ever did with you? I'm deathly scared of this more than anything else. :( being someone mentally ill makes me feel like anyone who is normal and healthy would just be a better more deserving partner than me."
The “borderline” girl,425,bfvhbd,87,"EDIT:  to the guys with BPD. Please don’t read this as invalidating your experience. This is just a vent/rant from a female perspective. I fully understand that both men and women suffer equally and in unique ways.  Love to all❤️

Everyone loves a borderline girl. Exciting, adventurous, dramatic, sexual.... until she goes “crazy”. Then she’s not so hot anymore. Then she becomes baggage.  A problem they wish would just go away.  And for that borderline girl. When she’s left alone and abandoned, she’s feeling like it’s all her fault. Another person has seen her for who she is - although strong, beautiful and exciting she’s a mess. And for some it’s too much of a risk to take. We just want to be loved, for who we truly are , the good and the bad. Like everyone else."
“Why are you so tired all the time?”,424,ag8ki1,53,"I cycled through every human emotion possible at an extreme level over the past hour, Barbara, you try that out and let me know how you feel "
DAE have a problem with down votes triggering feelings of rejection? Because this shit has been really demoralizing for me...,426,abytxb,60,"I work up the courage to post and get some of what I've spent my whole life bottling up out, only for strangers to make me feel even more invalidated than I already do, by the simple click of an arrow... I know that's ridiculous... And I know I shouldn't care... but I do. I care so much that I obsess over it. 

I'm an approval junkie, and I don't know how to not be.

I'm desperate for approval, but then I want to tell the world to fuck off when I don't get it. 

I fucking hate this.

And by this I mean myself.

This isn't the only reason I keep looping back to the image of finally blowing my brains out... but it is probably the most ridiculous one.

EDIT: Holy shit! I didn't imagine this many people would feel the same way, but I honestly feel a lot better now that I know so many do. The constant compulsive checking and refreshing  makes me feel so neurotic when I catch myself doing it...and I just get so embarrassed with how effected I am by these things. I have actually turned off all the notifications on my phone that I can, and I've gone through several bouts of deactivating social media like many of you mentioned. I try leaving my phone in separate rooms, and flipping it over so I can't see the screen... I get the rushes of anxiety, and the feelings of devaluation... All of it. 

Thank you all so much for your input and support! 

I also have to point out that the irony of this being my most up voted post is not lost on me lol..."
"I think one of my cruelest traits is being very self aware of how I feel and what I'm doing but helplessly watch it unravel over my actions, people and anything that matters",431,lem47o,18,"I wish I was dumb, completely oblivious to where I am mentally; It's so hard to stay in stability because there's impeding doom that suffocates me, telling it's only temporary and I shouldn't allow myself to comfortable in it and it's true, it always is; either I completely blow shit up or something finds it's way to me

I want to get better and I'm hanging it all on the ""what if"", it's what I've held on for so long but how many times do I have to watch myself ruin it over and over again? Yes, there are bad days and that's part of being human but this is crazy, I self loathe enough to know that I shouldn't call myself that.

Dear me, I'm sorry for everything, the effort you put in which I easily dismantle, for disrupting the consistency it takes to make a meaningful change, I'm sorry I'm cruel to you, you really do try and it is valid

I remember Picard saying something like ""Sometimes you can do everything right and still fail, that's not losing, that's just life"" I'm just going to hold on to that;

I know that isn't completely applicable to me, I am responsible for my actions and choices but I can't hold myself to that today, I'm just too tired, I just need comfort, whatever form that takes, one second where everything feels ""Okay"""
Does anyone else struggle to understand what a reasonable amount of affection looks like,425,htjvdj,37,"I feel like I have no real line in my mind about what level of affection I should be able to expect from other people. I feel like I have endless amounts of love to give to people and don't understand why they can't do the same for me. I know people should have boundaries but I often feel boxed out.

My boyfriend is not a super emotional/touchy-feely/words of affirmation kind of guy; he does give me his time and love in other ways, but I feel like it's never enough. My ex was a much more openly affectionate person and yet that never felt enough either. 

Even with friends I often start to feel resentful over time because the relationships feel one-sided, although I know that this probably isn't the case.

I guess this is black and white thinking but if anyone has struggled with the same thing and has advice I would appreciate it."
"Anyone else hears their name and think ""oh yeah that's what people call me""",428,hqzwz6,44,"I don't even call myself anything, most of the time I barely realize I exist lol.

Anyone else can't remember much of their childhood?,426,ekdjm9,78,"I do have some memories, but not nearly as many as other people do about their childhood. I have maybe 2 memories of being age 5-6 and a few under age of 10. My clearest memories start anything after age 13. Anyone else?"
I wish people understood that I need to talk things out,424,bb99m4,79,"I drive myself crazy when I don’t know what’s going on in a situation. I have to talk my feelings out. I have to figure things out. I don’t like to leave any room for assumptions because when I start assuming, I can’t stop. I make lots of scenarios in my head and it drives me to be angry, sad, etc. I am aware that I am like this and make it known to people but they don’t listen. When they don’t listen, I only get more upset. 

This just goes back to a post I made before about how being alone might just be better. I don’t see why it’s so hard to just sit down and converse. It saves a lot of time and confusion. 

It’s only AFTER I react to someone not doing a simple thing that people want to act like I’m ‘crazy.’ If I ask you to tell me why you feel a certain way, I’m doing it for the both of us. If you shut down, give me a half-ass answer, etc. I won’t know what to do with myself or our situation. And I shouldn’t have to know. I cannot read minds.

BPD or not, everyone deserves SOMETHING. I hate this “no one owes you anything” attitude that everyone has. I get that maybe it’s true... but when you care about someone why would you not do everything you can to give them reassurance and comfort? Especially when you know they’re struggling mentally."
"It's shocking, scrolling through this subreddit",426,awbbsu,47,"It's just thousands of people echoing my thoughts. People who think like me and understand my experience.  This is just beautiful.  And awful.  It's thousands of us sounding off, ""We hate this!  Why us! Fuck!""

"I think I should no longer interact with people, it's so straining, calculating what they're thinking, finding their intentions, finally finding a perfect FP, only to ruin it all by myself.",424,llp7bu,60,"Time and time again, same formula, different circumstances, different people

I pick out parts of me they like, light up like a billboard giving them every reason not to leave me while holding up a sign saying "" I know you're going to leave, just do it already"" 

I'm tired of this cycle, I'm tired of feeling so intensely, it's either mania or depression and oh wait, total chronic emptiness, I don't even know what normal is like, how do other people handle things? What do they feel on a daily basis? I mean how does one deal with a simultaneous realisation that they're perfect and they're worth nothing? 

All these people, these choices, disappointing them, watching the affection they had for you fade away while consciously knowing only you are responsible is cruel

I'm helpless, I'm dumbfolded even, I should be able to watch out by now but I only reflect when the cycle ends 

I'm out, I'm never letting anyone in again, first of all, it's cruel to them, no one should have the bad luck of being a part of my life, second of all, I can survive alone, I don't need to thrive, I'll just go fuck myself and likely die in the next few months

"So, does anyone feel more comfortable in fantasyland than in the real world?",425,gommiw,54,"As a child, all of my emotions were validated by fictional characters in movies, books, etc. or musicians, not from anyone that raised me.

And it feels like anything that makes me think about the future takes me out of that headspace and I panic and want to die because I feel like I have no future.

Edit: Thank you all for your kind comments and regards. I have recently discovered this community and its been incredibly helpful.

Absolutely no sense of self,427,fvh4gz,53,"This is awful. Not knowing who I really am, not being able to tell what are my values, what I stand for, my interests, etc. Everything about me changes constantly. Beneath all these stories I tell about myself there is nothing but a bottomless pit. I am the void. The abyss.

I am aware people probably find it weird but I’m not embarrassed or worried about it. It makes me feel happy so I don’t really care. I just wondered if it’s a bpd thing or am I just a bit strange? Does anyone know what makes people act like this?

"As of today, I (F27) am no longer a patient in the community mental health service/psychiatric system after 4 years!",425,gxp1y0,19,"Hey guys!

Yesterday I had my last therapy session in the psychiatric system after being a patient since 2016.
It is both scary, parts of me doesn't feel ready but a bigger part of me, is actually damn proud and thankful for the fact, that I have evolved and improved so incredibly much and that the professionals think I am not that sick anymore.
Before seeing a psychiatrist, I was treated by a psychologist for what she believed was *generalised anxiety, panic disorder and OCD* and we mainly worked with cognitive behavioural therapy. I was feeling very unwell and she wanted me to see a psychiatrist and hopefully receive medical treatment.

I have been through a lot in the system, here's the story short.

1. Seeing a private psychiatrist, who first treated me for major depression (severe) and anxiety + some OCD symptoms. I started antidepressants and that triggered, what the psychiatrist thought was a hypomanic episode and I was diagnosed with *bipolar disorder*. Then I started treatment with Quetiapine without any significant change and he wanted to start me on Lithium, but I wasn't feeling safe so I needed to move on in the system.

2.  Then I became a patient in the community mental health service. Here I was treated by some not so competent doctors and a nurse. They started me for instance on Valproate without any effect. They wanted me clarified for borderline, but a specialised psychologist quickly cleared me for borderline - ""you are way too healthy in your mind to have Borderline""

3. After the unsuccessful diagnosing, the local community mental services sent me on to the specialised unit for affective disorders in my county. It was a very underwhelming experience, only diagnosing with a psychiatrist and no supportive talks or therapy. I became more and more ill, because I only had a talk once every two months and only about medicine.

4. I called the acute psychiatric clinic a lot at this time, fall 2017, and was a patient in their acute team some weeks and in December 2017 I had a 10 day long admission to a psychiatric hospital, where I was severely depressed/in a mixed bipolar episode. A psychiatrist there cleared out my diagnoses again and diagnosed me, besides *bipolar*, with *borderline personality disorder and avoidant personality disorder*

5. After the admission, I got back into the local psychiatric clinic, this time again with an incompetent nurse, no therapy and I was miserable. At this time I started seeing a specialised psychologist in psychiatry and he wasn't content with my treatment,so he helped me on in the system.

7. The last stop on my journey through the Danish psychiatric system, started two years ago. I was being declared ready for therapy, targeted on my borderline diagnosis at a psychiatric clinic. I started with some psychoeducation, medicine adjustments (many of them) and then a year of mentalisation based group therapy. The group therapy ended in November and I had individual therapy sessions with my two therapists, with the last ever session yesterday. The psychiatrist at the clinic decided to remove my bipolar diagnosis, because she thinks my problems are all related to my personality disorder(s).
These two years have been so helpful. The group therapy was SO effective and resonated deeply in me, I learned so much and my therapists have been AMAZING. 

When I started group therapy in November 2018, I was very sick. I had a lot of suicidal ideation, was so afraid, did a lot of head banging, I couldn't keep eye contact, I was hopeless, despondent, felt badly treated, left alone, let down. I was a victim. I seeked other's protection all the time and was helpless. I was sure I would shatter, if I was left alone. 
In May 2019, my ex boyfriend of 8 years left me because of my mental health problems. In September 2019, my beloved mum died, way too young, only 62 yo.
And besides this, which my therapists thought would CRUSH me... I am standing on my own two feet. After years of numerous kinds and combinations of medicine, numerous psychiatrists, numerous diagnoses and therapists.

I am living alone for the first time ever and it is going SO well. My suicidal ideation is almost gone. I am having better days more frequently and it is easier for me, to drag myself up again, when I fall. Self harm is at a bare minimum. I am capable of mentalising.
I am in a relationship with a wonderful woman who actually also has borderline (+ schizophrenia), but we are so good together.
I still have somewhat severe mood swings, and I can have days, where I am very depressed, but I have learned to go softer on my self and be more accepting and loving.
I have been out of job for three years but slowly but surely, I am soon ready to start working again. I am not a victim anymore.
My therapists are so extremely proud of me and my process and they got both goosebumps and tears in their eyes, when we said goodbye yesterday. It was very hard for me, I miss them a lot already, especially with my attachment problems/feeling left, but I can cope.


I am not completely well. I still have issues. I still have a LOT of work to do. I am still on a lot of medication and I need to be some time but eventually I can try to get off it with a doctor.
Besides these things, I am better than in several years and damn, I am so proud.

Recovery is possible. I have seen rock bottom, but I got my life back.
We can get better.

THANK YOU for reading."
"Kind of small, but I just cut an 'emerging' favourite person down",422,duu7an,32,"You know it. You meet someone, boom, 24 hours later you've mapped out your future. For me, this is always in a romantic sense. This person likes me; I've got my hopes up. BPD me is like ""DATE THEM, MAKE IT EXCLUSIVE, TIE THEM DOWN SO THEY CAN'T LEAVE YOU.""

You know what I did? 

I told this person when it came up in the conversation that I'm not in the place to date seriously, that I'm happy to see where things go and just hang out and have fun. I didn't pressure them to date me, or try and work out if they wanted to date me. I left it light and breezy. 

Obviously the BPD part of my brain is screaming, but I actually managed to do it. I actually managed to convince myself that this person is NOT my soulmate, I've known them a week and that trying to lock them down in a relationship is neither healthy nor wise for either of us. 

This may seem tiny, but for me this is a massive achievement."

BPD and the Inner Child,428,ftubo5,83,"Ok so... I follow an account called [The Holistic Psychologist](https://www.instagram.com/the.holistic.psychologist/) on instagram and she's a handy source of insight. I came across this particular post on the inner child and have transcribed it (for myself really) but posted it here on the off-chance someone else might find it relatable. I've found a lot of this really useful while i've been learning about the origin of my emotional responses/reactions, and hope you do too.

\---

The inner child is an unconscious part of the mind where we carry our unmet needs, suppressed childhood emotions, our creativity, our intuition, + our ability to play

The inner child is the child still within us whose experiences didn’t just “go away.” We see the world through our lens of the inner child.

As children, our core needs are to be seen, heard, + authentically expressed as ourselves. We do not have the emotional maturity to process our emotional experiences + need a parent to guide us through “big” emotions.

**A wounded inner child looks like:**

1. Acting out when hurt or overwhelmed the same way we did as children: door slamming, screaming, shutting down, stomping off.
2. Denying your own reality and the reality of other people’s experience.
3. Easily defensive with childlike black & white (and/or) thinking
4. Has child-like fantasies of a romantic partner “rescuing” them
5. Views parents as all knowing & continues to desperately seek what a parent is not able to give
6. Betrays self regularly to receive love
7. Shames others for their beliefs or behaviours
8. Constantly compares self to others while feeling inferior

&#x200B;

As children, we got many messages (from parents, the school system, friends, & community) that confused or scared us & began to disconnect from our child-like nature.

**Some examples include:**

1. “you’re too (insert description)” *sensitive, weak, dramatic, serious etc.*
2. “you’re not good at (insert description)” *maths, sports, sharing, etc.*
3. “just be polite” (often dismissing child’s boundaries)
4. “Don’t talk like that, act like that, do that”
5. “you should be more like (insert person)” *a sibling, a friend, someone on TV*
6. “You’ll never have (insert description) *money, an education, a partner, anything else desired*
7. “You are too (physical description)” *skinny, fat, tall, a certain ethnicity etc*
8. You MADE me (specific action or emotion)” *hit you, angry, sad, depressed, reactive in some way.*

&#x200B;

As children we take everything said to us/about us as truth. We internalise these (false) truths then speak in the same way to ourselves through adulthood.

Healing the inner child involves becoming a wise inner parent to ourselves that sees & hears our experience without judgement.

**Wise inner parent mantras to heal (take a deep breath, pause, place your hand on your heart)**

1. “I am safe to be myself”
2. “It is ok to be misunderstood”
3. “it is ok to be afraid, I am here to protect you now”
4. “I do not need to betray myself to receive love”
5. “my parents are wounded human beings who unconsciously projected their now traumas”
6. “I am creative & worthy of creating”
7. “I do not need to be anything or anyone else other than how I actually am”
8. “I am supported”

**Powerful healing exercises for the inner child:**

1. A guided inner child meditation from youtube
2. Write a letter *(if you like with your left hand to channel the inner child)* acknowledging what you witnessed or went through as a child.
3. Share your honest emotions to a partner or loved one you feel safe and secure with *(eg “I am feeling scared you may leave me”)*
4. Picture a moment you were hurt by an adult then allow all of those emotions to come out in a primal way *(screaming, punching pillows, guttural crying)*
5. Hold your heart and tell your inner child what you wanted an adult to do for you when you needed it most.

Potato for your time 🥔x"
I'm SICK of people armchair diagnosing the problematic person of the week with BPD or other personality disorders.,423,fnkv7r,71,"In light of recent drama (just go look at any youtube drama channel and you'll figure it out quickly), I'm getting really tired of people trying to dx personality disorders online. It's really disgusting to watch how these disorders are talked about and thrown around like it's nothing. Just 'meh meh borderline personality disorder = bad person disorder'. And I get it. I've done really fucked up shit. I'm sure that in reaction to our fucked up thoughts, we've all done some awful things. But that's OUR business. We CHOSE to get out there and figure out what's going on and we're actively trying to get better. I don't think it's fair to just 'dx' people with things when you've never personally interacted with them. Also, it's just funny people are trying to diagnose someone when the behavior that's being called out is that they are LITERALLY trying to diagnose themselves with a thing.  

This post is not necessarily talking down self dx. That's a can of worms I am NOT getting into. The person getting called out is representing a mental illness in a highly offensive and inaccurate way to their MILLIONS of fans. I'm tired of people making videos talking about how they're  narcissist or a sociopath or whatever. The person in question claims to have professionally diagnosed with BPD traits, and I can understand wanting to examine their behavior through the lens of that. I can't understand how people think it's okay to talk so shittily about personality disorders in general. 

PDs are highly stigmatized and this is actively harming people who are trying to get treatment. It's messed up."
Being bpd feels like carrying around a big secret all the time,427,m5e2j9,43,"I’m so sensitive to every little thing and then internalize it to survive. And then it all collects until I break down and have a panic attack and can’t stop crying. Everything feels painful; the mediocre, the good, the bad. It all gets funneled through my brain and comes out as painful."
To anyone who needs to hear this.,420,i5x8j1,44,"Our constant need for attention is no different than an addiction, we crave what we never got as a child from those whose job it was to provide for us. Looking to fill that void from those who make us feel good. Its not anyone's responsibility to feed that addiction, its our responsibility to fight that addiction and function in healthy relationships. Our toxic and manipulate behavior towards others are nothing but a side effect of that addiction, don't let it win. Don't let it sabotage everything good you have left in your life. Its not easy, the road to recovery is long and arduous. But we have all survived through much worse, we are strong, we are resilient. This disease will try to fool you into thinking your weak and hopeless, don't let it. We may have grown off it, but it doesn't have to define us. Keep fighting, don't let it win."
"went into target, only bought what i went in there for",419,bleph5,63,i have been struggling a lot with impulse spending so this feels like a huge win!!! anyone else struggle with excessive spending?
"They need to add mental health screenings and treatment in the ""vaccinations & doctor's visit"" list of things kids need to get before going to school. I think about all of the issues I have now are simply a cumulation of abuse suffered as a child.",417,i0gthe,28,"I've been thinking about all of those people that can be stable fucking human beings, while I can't function for 1 week with a mental breakdown, shutting someone out of my life passive aggressively, or  the pit of emptiness that cuts through my core like I am a donut?

&#x200B;

Think about it, we make make sure kids have all of these things to make them successful but fail to care about the 1 thing that rules it all? It's sickening that we haven't made it to that point yet. To take it even further, if we ensure our kids grow up responsible and stable, we can ensure they will grow up to be responsible and stable adults that can coach and support their children to be the same? I truly feel this would be a huge interruption in the cycle. Mental health issues are so common, yet I still feel like I have to ""coax"" someone before sharing a part of me?

It really sucks and I don't care about how much 'support' there is out there it gets really hard to care when none of it is your fault and you can't fix your brain. A lot of my issues that make me so impulsive are simple things that my parents SHOULD have taught me, but didn't have the capital to do it. It is not about what happens to you in life because there are many people that have had horrific things happen to them and they are able to recover and heal. It is really all about you handle your issues. Unfortunately those of us with personality disorders have developed key traits that are poorly disguised ""good"" ways to deal with our issues. Instead, they are just self-reinforcing toxic beliefs that are causing us to act in ways that negatively impact ourselves and others.

&#x200B;

We definitely need to do better for our children."
DAE have an insatiable hunger for validation?,423,fxuosy,56,"I constantly need to be told I’m pretty, smart, loved, etc. Doesn’t matter who from, could be a random creepy dude on the internet. I love hearing it. I literally cannot get enough. It’s like a drug. I need to hear how perfect and great i am more and more in order to actually consider believing it. That belief only last a little before disappearing... leaving the hunger for validation even stronger than before. Anyone else feel the same?"
DAE literally have no friends?,423,fhhwvo,147,"I see and hear people say ""I don't have any friends ugh"" and then meet up with people like 5 times a week. I mean I get it, it's probably a shallow friendship but at least you have someone to do stuff with.
When I say I don't have friends I literally mean 0.
I don't have anyone right now to just text and go have a drink or meet up. Not even just text.


Edit: what would you guys thinks about some sort of group chat? I don't know how to start any of this but if someone starts one for us 0frienders I'd be glad to join!

Edit2: I made a dsicord! https://discord.gg/bYypk7G
I hope it works I've never made my own server
(I changed the link because it might have not worked anymore because I forgot to check a box I'm sorry)"
We're the most misinformed illness out there. We're also ranked as #1 as most emotionally painful.,419,fgscuk,102,"The sad truth about BPD is that the over simplification of it leads to misinformation and a general poor understanding of the disorder. This dynamic actually reinforces the maladaptive beliefs that underlie their symptomology. Therefore, too often our misguided efforts to help these people actually causes them more harm and makes their symptoms worse. Then in turn, the pw BPD causes us more harm with their erratic behavior."
I think the reason why we feel the urge to impulsively do drastic things is because we want things to change right at that moment,423,czhkav,42,"And the hardest part is trying to fight that urge and remember that the last time you did it, you regretted it. 

It’s so hard to fight the urge to impulsively block someone close to you off of everything, or get really plastered, or scream at your FP. You know you’ll regret it tomorrow, but don’t care at that moment. It’s what I’m feeling right now."
"DAE Wish that they could temporarily trade your feelings and trauma with a friend or family member so they can finally, truly empathize with you and know you?",417,kmhkhs,50,"I get their emotional stability and happy childhood memories. They get all the fire and brimstone intensity of my feelings and memories of the years of raw torture and abuse. It doesn't happen to them, but they know my memories to the truly vivid degree of what I have to deal with every day.

And I'd love to give them all the emotionally detached, unsupportive fluff they give others.

""Go to therapy and get medicated. Love yourself. I'm sorry for you, but you have to let go of the past.""

It's hard to describe.

It's like you are in a deep ditch and they throw a rope halfway down. And they are saying ""just climb."" And they don't get anyone else to help you. They actually have a picnic at the top of the ditch. You're invited if you can climb up in five minutes despite the rope being only halfway down.

Oh, and if you complain that it's too deep for you to climb and that you need a longer rope, they abandon you there and move their picnic to a more sunny place. And they unhitch and drop the rope for good measure.

And when you finally climb out of the ditch, you have to dig your way up by scraping your fingers and toes into the dirt. And you are always stuck not just with your memories of being in the ditch, but the torture of climbing your way out.

And then you see that asshole that ""helped"" you and you wish you could throw 'em into the ditch and tell them they're invited to your picnic if they can climb their way out.

If any of you lurking have truly recovered from BPD...idk man, you are truly better than other people. Like, an actual superhuman. A true champion.

I feel like I am so wary of people who use the words depression, anxiety, trauma and post-traumatic stress lightly. Sometimes, all I hear is ""oh, I've been in a ditch too, once..it was this little hole in the ground that almost caused me to trip, but I didn't.""

And I have to empathize and praise them. ""I'm sorry, it must have been scary to almost fall down, but it's great that you caught yourself in time.""
Even if they did fall down in their metaphorical scenario, it would have taken them two seconds to stand up again."
DAE forgets why they are upset after calming from an episode,421,ix1m1b,39,So I get triggered by many things easily and it causes me to react to it almost instantly. After lashing out does anyone sometimes feel so guilty until you forget why you are upset in the first place?
"Today, I succeeded.",418,gc04bz,25,"I was in bed chilling with my boyfriend, and had a trigger moment. Instead of wallowing and spiraling, I pulled out my phone and did a DBT diary entry, and voiced my concern. We talked through it. I felt so empowered afterwards, and we turned what normally turns into a frustrating fight into a success that we worked through.

It DOES Get better, folks."
Does anyone else love specifics,416,dz4h7u,42,"I have a very hard time with not knowing the specifics of why people perceive me the way they do. When someone tells me they love me I want to know WHY they love me, what things I’ve done to make me lovable. When someone tells me I’m pretty I want to know WHY they think I’m pretty or kind or funny or any compliment I get.  If someone says they had a good time with me I want to know why it was good. I want to know things I did to make them believe these things.  I sometimes get upset at generic compliments because I love them to be specific to me and not something that could be said to anyone.  I don’t know why I think this way and I wish I could be 100% okay with any compliment"
DAE hear their inner voice insult them or tell them to kill themselves?,419,im3nrb,60,"So basically I hear my inner voice thrash talk myself or tell me to kill myself but it's not like an auditory hallucination. It really is like me but a subconscious voice and it's not me triggering it but small uncomfortable situation or bad thought can. It's really annoying because even when things are going fine (but less often) it can just pop in my head, it does happen really often; often over a hundred time a day, just about every day too.

The message is clearly in line with all the self doubt and hate I feel over myself but the frequency and violence of the message is exhausting to deal with. I don't really share too much of my emotions even if they are intense so I assume it's some repressed version of them popping up. I'm just wondering if this is a part of BDP or there might be something else. I have to be clear that I sadly use drugs to cope but it doesn't seem to be originating from that.

Thanks."
Does anyone else feel like their calmest and most stable frame of mind is just after an episode?,417,e4pii2,41,"I just spent about 4 hours going through the worst episode I’ve had in a couple of months and now I feel so logical and calm it’s ridiculous. Like I messaged my mum thanking her for tea, asked my FP to call me later in a calm and reasonable manner... wtf!"
pwBPD are not cold manipulators who lure you in to hurt you,419,dbywyd,58,"I felt inspired to make this post after reading an AITA post where OP was making blanket assumptions about BPD.

As someone who's struggled with BPD all my life, and done and said some toxic things to people I cared about, I'm always trying my very best to improve with every new person I meet. What you claim to be ""BPD people acting nice in order to manipulate you"" is in reality my trying my best to be a better person. It's a genuine part of my personality.

BPD is hard to deal with. It's a fucked up illness and most people can only control it, not completely get rid of it. Just like a person with alcoholism may relapse, so can BPD people with good intentions lash out in times in distress. *This is not an intentional manipulation mechanism.* We really were as nice or as loving as we appeared! We weren't faking it in order to get into your good graces! We just have an illness that we're trying to recover from but it's so hard and we slipped up and we're really sorry. And it doesn't excuse any damage we did to you, but please don't frame us as doing it on purpose and that our kindness and caring was a front.

I just wanted to say this. To all pwBPD out there, you can do better every time. It hurts when a loved one cuts you off or when you feel like you have to cut them off, but always believe that you can do better.

EDIT: My first gold!! Thank you so much kind reddit stranger <3"
Is anyone else really aware of how all the wrong choices you made have brought you to this very moment and you are now suffering the consequences of your actions?,420,alufzm,68,"Really fucking tragic. I wish I could go back to 10 years ago, it's just not the right path."
"I struggle everyday with recognizing emotions, and this has helped a lot. Hope it helps others.",421,84hqhi,40,
"DAE feel like theyre ""in love"" every time you simply like someone?",412,kk7mlp,65,"I recently looked up ""how to tell if you're falling in love"" and was shocked to find the things listed as like base level I guess i felt like I feel all those things listed when I simply like someone. Falling in love I always thought was some secret hidden thing that only happened with special people but I've felt all those things for people I simply thought I liked. So maybe that has to do with feeling things intensely, does anyone else get the stereotypical in love feelings and experience almost every time you simply like someone? I feel i am either in love or indifferent and there's very little in-between. But the more i think about it I know there are deeper feelings I've felt than those described and I wonder if regular people don't access those deep feelings and if being in love for them is just my surface level like feeling it makes me question a lot about my experience living and how other people might experience living and love."
I’m not gonna have sex on the first date anymore,415,bmjpxt,63,"It’s not gonna make him more likely to stay. If he really likes me, he’ll stick around. He’ll want to get to know me rather than leaving the second I tell him that I can’t have sex with someone I’m not in a committed relationship with. He’ll respect my boundaries instead of trying to sweet talk his way into my pants.

In past sexual encounters I’ve had with men I’ve never enjoyed myself. All I could think about was how this man doesn’t love me, that he can get this from anyone else and it’s not special. But I want it to be special. I deserve to be loved and respected and I’m tired of settling because I’m afraid of being alone.

I’m not having sex on the first date, the second date, or any other dates after that until the right guy shows me he’s not afraid of my borderline or afraid of commitment. It took me way too long to realize this. I don’t want to feel ashamed or dirty anymore."
I think the thing that frustrates me the most is accomplishing so much with simply containing an episode and having no acknowledgement,420,lv7hwq,30,"For someone who doesn't have bpd, I probably present as just taking a few minutes to sit quietly, there is no perceivable reference for how hard I just busted my ass. I feel a literal murderous rage and you don't even know."
Anyone else just stops functioning when their fp does something without you?,413,lnde74,69,Like my fp is out with her friends today and I just saw it on someone’s instagram story and it hit me like a train??? Why do I even feel like this? It shouldnt affect me like it does. It’s so hard to come up with an explanation for this. I felt my face go numb for a full minute and it felt as if I was paralysed. Admitting that I feel like this makes me look like an overly possessive and manipulative person and I dont want to be that. I dont let these feelings show but then I’m stuck feeling like shit for a day or two. In this state its impossible to do anything productive. I can just lie down and be upset. I hate this disorder
I just commented on something for the first time in reddit,409,l90k51,36,"(sorry if the flair is wrong. I couldn't figure out which one fit)

This is so dumb. But I'm on an adrenaline high from this and want to share. 

I'm terrified of posting on reddit. I posted once before (here coincidentally) a few months ago, and then freaked out and couldn't comment or even look at any of the responses for months. It's not just reddit, but any social media. The judgement and my need to be liked and valued is so overwhelming. So I just don't do it at all to alleviate myself off the anxiety. Even though I want to.

But today someone, once again, made a comment that promoted the stigma against personality disorders. And I just like... Couldn't. So I actually commented on it. I tried really hard not to be rude and explain how what was said is damaging. 

And I got an up vote while I was writing this post! Like, a real up vote! And maybe I'll still get down voted a lot, but at least somebody saw what I said and felt like it had value. 

I'm just so stupidly happy. It's a small, silly win. But a win.

Edit: oh my goodness! You guys are all absolutely amazing! The overwhelming support for such a small little win has been so heartwarming. ❤️ I'm working on responding to everyone now, but it might take me a while as I'll be responding between chores and work. But to all of you: thank you so much for your support and kind words. You're all wonderful."
Bpd isn’t an excuse,413,iuk0xm,164,"

Am I the only one who gets disgusted at people who use there bpd as an excuse to be an asshole or take no responsibility ? 


Like I’m very lucky to be self aware the way that I am. I’ve had behaviours and thought patterns in the past thy have caused me to be very toxic in the psy especially in romantic relationships. 

But since I’ve been diagnosed a year ago I’ve come on a long way. Through a mix of some dbt with my cpn (community psych nurse in the uk) and person work I’ve done on my own.  I still have a lot to go but even the way I respond to situations has massive improved and reduced the negative affect I’ve had on people around me.

The stigma around bpd is bad enough but it’s also made worse by people who use it as an excuse. 

Being diagnosed gives you the language and knowledge to explain your behaviour and to work on it. Even if you don’t have access to healthcare you probably have access to the internet. A unlimited recourses of research, tools and peers. For support. 

We can’t change ourselves over night and we can change all of our behaviour and thought patterns, but you can take responsibility.  You also can’t use your bpd as a reason for people not to hold you accountable and call you out on your shit 

Don’t just say ‘oh it’s my bpd’ when your actions negatively affect someone else. Atleast have a better attitude if ‘im like this because of my bpd or x,y,z , I understand what I’ve done isn’t okay and I need tk work on x,y,z.’ 

Obviously this isn’t for every situation or person but does someone atleast agree and see where I’m coming from.

Just because you have a condition doesn’t excuse your behaviour, it simply explains it."
Positive thoughts to posters who found their posts downvoted to zero points,411,f9abfz,5,"I'm sorry if this feels off-topic but I thought it was relevant in a sub for people who struggle with self-worth and a long history of rejection.

It shocked me to find so many support/venting/suicide posts in new downvoted to zero points. There were 30-50 of them. I upvoted them back to 1 point but they still show 50% upvoted.

I wouldn't have the nerve to leave my post up if that happened to me. I would delete it and never post here again. I am so impressed that so many of you hung in there and left your post up even after you saw zero points on your request for support."
Hate how BPD causes you to rapidly idolize someone then suddenly dislike them without reason to either,413,djbb6x,35,"I’ve been trying to make new friends & it can be extremely daunting to face the possibility of rejection. I meet someone awesome, have lovely hang-outs and generally get along. I see how this person really has it together and is genuinely better than me in every single way, and I cannot help but feel guilt they’re wasting time with me. They’re amazing, but then wait- a day goes by of them ignoring text messages etc & suddenly they’re a jerk. They don’t value your companionship & clearly hate you. 

It’s honestly exhausting feeling unable to judge someone’s character, how much of it is all in your head? Do they really dislike you or is your brain being mean? Are they truly amazing or are you just idolizing someone? Why do you feel the insatiable need for their attention?"
I hate the stigma of this disorder,414,8wax14,120,"I have never seen any other mental illness frequently discussed with such venom. Borderline seems to always be the explanation for a woman expressing severe emotions, regardless of the context or her history. They make false rape reports out of anger. They are incapable of long term relationships. They have daddy issues and baggage. They're gold diggers and addicts.

This isn't even a sentiment isolated to the internet. On the day I was diagnosed with BPD years ago, I decided to go to a bookstore for more information. The first thing that caught my eye was Borderline Personality Disorder for Dummies. Flipping through it, I noticed a significant amount of the book was devoted to the last section, ""How to Get Away From Someone with Borderline."" It was devastating to realize my fear of abandonment necessitated an instruction manual, and wasn't a fear so much as an inevitability.

I am capable of and deserve love too goddamnit. I can recognize when I'm being irrational and communicate my feelings. I am on medication and in therapy. The reason I have no family is because I was horrifically abused, not because I drove them away. I have made tremendous progress and I am proud of it. I am not intrinsically a selfish, aggressive person. My disorder doesn't mean I should be thrown away.

I weighed myself today for the first time in a few months....,417,juple5,63,"Hi! Anorexia for me. 😞

My last weigh in was back in Feb of this year. Just nearly March. I weighed in at 82lbs.

Today, after.... A long time of focusing on really trying to eat.... Because of the support of my friends and their love for me, amd encouragement, today I weighed in at 116.4lbs.

The number makes me shudder, and makes my stomach curl nauseatingly, yet I know I look better and healthier. And that what I see in the mirror isn't the truth. I still have... Serious eating issues, but every day I am working to better myself little by little. Focusing on bettering myself, mind and body."
Does anyone else KNOW they shouldn’t say something and say it anyways?,419,b0uv3q,54,"I’ll be arguing or upset with someone and something super mean to say will pop into my mind. I will recognize that it is mean, I know it will be hurtful, and proceed to say it anyways. It’ll feel like I physically HAVE to say it or I’ll just be thinking it over and over and over. It’s like a lack of impulse control except I know I shouldn’t but feel like I NEED to anyways. Is this common for other people or am I just a shitty person lol"
"""How are you still single?""",415,8ho5k2,59,Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. You don't want to know. Don't try to find out why. 
"DAE never felt ""chosen""",410,dli4c9,43,"Ever since I was young I have always wanted to be someones best friend. That person that somebody goes to with everything, who always wants to hangout and spend time with. I have grown up always being second, maybe even third place. There is always someone better or more important.

I was that kid in school who would get left out of group gatherings, parties, always finding out about them after. Even with being in a relationship with someone I still crave that strong friendship. 

I want to be someones FP - but I have a tendency to freak out when that person who I hold dear is talking to other people more than me. It makes me feel small and invalidated. 

I crave that friendship more than anything, but no matter how hard I try I always fall short.

Edit: I didn't expect this many people to share the same feelings that I do. Thank you guys for sharing your own stories and helping others. Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like."
Is anyone else here obsessed with their disorder?,410,m2k5or,67,"Is anyone else here obsessed with their BPD? Almost like you center your whole identity and personality around the fact that you're borderline? I feel like a lot of my internal dialogue focuses around how my symptoms will manifest in my daily life, almost as if I am forcing myself to have symptoms. I even fantasize and daydream about raging on people who have hurt me in the past and think about the awful things I can say to them. It gets to the point that I am worried I could be on some ego trip and could secretly be a narcissist? I don't really feel inherently grandiose, in fact I tend to believe I am below everyone else. I also feel like I can't really be around other ppl if I know they have BPD because I feel like I have to compete with them via symptoms or like I have to present the exact same way as they do or I am not actually BPD. Lol I probably sound insane right now."
Y’all ever get that feeling at 3am of just being euphoric and happy for no reason and just wish you felt like this all the time?,413,kl29l0,26,"I would honestly rather be happy than sad - but only when I remember and feel real happiness, but it’s so fleeting. 

The rest of the time I don’t often feel much of anything and its easier to chase numbness away with depression than joy. 

I think that if I felt so happy and positive more of the time, I would be able to succeed more in life. Id be more motivated and happy. 

Already my one minute of happiness is slipping away and I feel depression creeping back in. God damn it."
DAE Not know if certain memories are real or made up,414,kdt3pb,33,"Sometimes I think I made all of this shit up. Like being bullied. Maybe I'm just dramatic. What if all of this wasn't that bad and I just made it that bad in my head? What if that so called bullying I went through were just small little things that I made big in my head? And what about all those other traumatic events that rest in my head?

Has anyone else feelings like this? I'm not sure anymore what's real and what I might have made up. Because I know when I was little, I often made things up just to be ""cool"" and be liked by others. What if all of this is just the result and now I'm not knowing anymore what's real?
Are they real traumatic experiences or just made up?
I wish I could tell."
Does anyone else dissociate when speaking to people you don't really know that well?,409,jjnu0z,42,"Besides my family and the wonderful mental health professionals I see who I know are genuinely trying to help me....when I speak to people, I am just ...not there.

I got my hair cut yesterday and the whole conversation I felt I said things but didn't feel like I was the one saying them..I was nervous, said things I thought a ""normal"" person would say.  I just couldn't wait for the cut to be over with.  And I just felt like it wasn't ME having the conversation. 

On the way home, I started thinking and realized that this happens a lot.  With other parents at my sons school, my sons coaches, etc.  

I do have very bad social anxiety, so idk if it's that or my BPD? either way, it sucks and I hate it.

Anyone else?

Edit - wow I wasn't expecting so many replies, thank you all!!! I feel very less alone now, also makes me sad though at the same other people experience this strange, unsettling feeling. Thank you guys again for taking the time to comment"
anyone else feel like they’re one bad day away from killing themselves,413,gxblr0,81,"like just a couple more intense blow ups or spirals and you’ll just do it. it feels super weird because i don’t really wanna die but the idea of continuing to live this way for the rest of my life sounds so incredibly exhausting. like the rest of my life? what the fuck? i didn’t ask to have a traumatic childhood and now i have to deal with this shit? 

i’m so tired of spiraling, of getting angry, of getting so so sad, of getting stupidly jealous, of feeling like i deserve everything bad. i’m tired of drinking and doing drugs to not feel and being sober and feeling like absolute garbage. 

and i’ve been making improvements lately but i still have these awful moments 

not gonna do it but oh do i fantasize of just not feeling"
Does anyone else feel 100 times better when they're dating someone?,411,fvuc8f,105,"I feel like a completely different person when I'm dating someone. I struggle with suicidal ideation and feelings of pointlessness but as soon as someone new enters my life it's like a switch flips and I'm a completely different person. Like I suddenly want to engage in life and take care of myself. But it doesn't feel very real because I never get better just for myself. 

I don't know if this is a bpd thing or its a normal thing that everyone feels when they start dating. It's just that the difference is so big for me that makes it confusing."
"thought I had a personality. turns out I have BPD, that's all.",412,hfulc6,65,"Seriously. So many things which I thought were ""me"", are stuff that all people who experience BPD have.
There's literally no ""me"" because all I've ever known about me are the  ""BPD personality"" traits. I have no personality in the true meaning of the word.
Sometimes my real me seems to come out in very odd weird ways, not enough to know what makes me, me.
I'm happy I realized this. BPDmeme subreddit helped me receive the slap with humour. And I find many posts here relatable. I can put all these things I never managed to really explain to myself in the same pot. Thank you.

*Update: I want to add, that realizing this, for me personally it felt like a weight lifting off my shoulders.* 

Let me explain. 
Having realized plainly that some things which I defended and treated as ""specific me me"" are not that specific to me but rather the behaviors that result from the type of childhood which *creates* those behaviors.. my *personal investment* in *those* is coming down. Whereas before I felt like defending them in me and ""protecting "" them in me because "" these are MY things"" now they just became a something that exists because of xyz reasons. Has nothing to do with me. And so that helps me look more straightforward at some of the things that I defended in me for years. For example, I change my mind often and I always attributed that in me to "" being unique, being really honest about myself, others are fake and lie to themselves"" and I defended it in me even though it *felt* like confusion and being lost every time. Not even once have I looked at it detached. Now that I saw that this trait may come and does often come with BPD, my personal investment in it is not as much. Actually , I just look at it now as "" Okay, let's see how we tackle this."" I'm detached from it. That's a win. I am not instantly ""cured"" but this mini revelations gave me perspective and detachment. And also I am excited to *discover* what makes me , me. My true characteristics are underneath all this, because these BPD personality traits were ""given"" to me. I want to see beyond that.💪"
does anyone else dislike big friend groups?,416,hckat3,52,"usually whenever one of my friends introduces me to their friends and our friends come together to make a group, i get very uncomfortable. be it because of jealousy or whatever other reason, i have the intense urge to abandon everyone and never speak to them again. i just can't handle being around more than 2 people, and my personality usually doesn't mesh well with everyone else's. i'm too serious, too angry, too sensitive to my own emotions and not sensitive enough to everyone else's. as i see my friend getting closer to everyone else, i drift further and further away. i know they are allowed to have friends other than me, but my bpd is just screaming."
A complaint about this sub...,410,b471kd,118,"I've been using this sub now for quite some time, and honestly stopped being so active because I noticed this.

The more I used this sub to ask for advice about certain symptoms and behaviours, it only got downvotes and negative replies, and now I realise that people don't want to talk about the negative symptoms of BPD - even other people with BPD.

This really grates on me, and while I love this sub for support from others in the same boat, I can't stand the fact that this should be our safe space, and we still get shit for posting the things we wouldn't want to post to twitter or facebook.

&#x200B;

When people come here with a story about something negative they did or said, they are looking for advice to change that behaviour, to become a better person and fight that part of themselves. No one comes here to glorify abusive behaviour, so why are we all so against reading it and helping each other out?

The more we talk down on people who openly admit they've done something wrong, the more we add to our own stigma, the more other people will begin to believe that we are all inherently toxic people, and less people will be willing to reach out and ask for help.

&#x200B;

I feel like this sub needs a kick into gear surrounding this topic - even if a seperate flair was created so anybody who doesn't need/want to see those posts (ie, partners/family members of those with BPD) doesn't have to see them, but anybody willing to read and understand and offer support and advice is welcome to in a safe and non-judgemental space, after all, isn't that one of the major points of DBT? No judgement? Remember that while reading these posts, we've all made mistakes and done things we regret.

&#x200B;

Please remember - not everyone can afford/has access to therapy and counselling. Some of us need help from wherever we can get it, and if you are fortunate enough to have access to therapy, share the things you learn with others - every little idea can help someone in need.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far "
A lot of you should think twice before viewing the sub,414,g267jl,73,"SUMMARY: This sub might be keeping you emotionally stagnant, you need to take care of yourself instead. You don't want to hear it nor do you care to, but you need to take care of yourself. 

When I first realized I might have BPD I immediately tried finding a subreddit, and within a minute of viewing the posts on here I had no doubt in my mind. It was so freeing, a gigantic weight was lifted off my shoulders, and I felt so loved without even having spoken to anyone. It'll probably forever be the most freeing experience of my life. 

I found great comfort in viewing the sub, but after a short while I started realizing that it wasn't giving me the same feeling it did before. Most posts that make the front page are DAE, while people actively struggling with something have their posts left pretty much unseen, as well as vent posts. 

Something I realized with the music I listened to was that the emotional tracks I played could be split 2 ways. There's songs that move you forward, and there're songs that take you nowhere. Songs that keep you emotionally stagnant - they keep you in a place of pain instead of pushing you out of it, and a lot of times can start making you think a way you didn't before. That's what happened with me and this subreddit. When I first viewed it it gave me a massive push forward in the right direction, but upon viewing it on more lonely and sad nights I noticed it just kept me in the same place I was already in. This wasn't good for me. 

Recently I isolated myself completely, pulled the plug on all social media and taking time for myself. Truly. It has felt so good finally having a peace of mind. For the first time in my life I'm not taking shit from anybody. It seems like an insane concept but I do actually think once I'm done with this self growth that I truly will not need anyone anymore. I used to be the guy that would try and please everybody just for the hopes of making a meaningful connection and unfortunately people view you as lesser just because of that kindness. But self care is what a lot of you need. You need to take care of yourself. I sound like the stereotypical jackass that just thinks saying is as easy is doing, but 6 months ago there was literally nothing you could say to convince me that taking care of myself was what I needed to do to get better. I instead wanted to ruin my life further & stay drowned in misery so it'd be easy enough one day to kill myself. But everything is one step at a time.

This post may seem confusing, but my point is not to make people stop viewing the sub - this post may not even apply to you - it's just think twice. Are you really going to feel better tomorrow because you chose to view the sub on a particularly sad/lonely night or is it just going to keep you at whatever low emotion you're currently feeling? Instead put on a song that's more upbeat. Or after you're done crying take some deep breaths and walk around a little bit. I constantly remind people that might be struggling with self care to always:

Brush your teeth, take a shower, eat a meal. In that order. 

I know you hate yourself and are filled with an equal amount of regret but you will eventually come to love yourself like I now do. Whenever you read things like these, someone from a high place telling you things can get better, your immediate thought is that whatever they experienced must not have been as bad as you, or that they simply just got lucky. I'm the same as you, I have BPD, I've made my mistakes, I've lost the only person I love, I've lied to avoid hospitalization, I've made detailed plans on how I was going to go out, I've felt the physical weight of all the emotional pain I was feeling, I've felt the heat and intensity of the anger I've frequently felt, I have been there. Just know that taking care of yourself, taking the steps needed to make yourself better, doesn't invalidate the pain you've endured and it most certainly doesn't mean you're letting go of someone if you're not ready to yet. I still miss her. Some nights are harder than others. But I wouldn't trade having this peace of mind for nearly anything."
"""Are you at risk to harm yourself?""",403,fe8cjl,51,"Whenever I get this question (doctors visit, therapist, etc) it's always like well yes...but also no...well, if something triggers me then yes...but I'm fine right now so no...but maybe in an hour I'll want to self harm...so kind of?

Am I alone in this?

Or with a therapist, trying to communicate that you're almost always suicidal, but not necessarily in the way that you'll end up trying something?  I always worry that I'll suddenly be involuntarily committed if I say the wrong thing."
DAE feel unworthy when no one replies to their Reddit post?,412,eolw2m,57,"I feel so shitty about myself, especially when I post something related to mental illness when no one replies to my post. I feel like no one cares about me and my problems are super insignificant. I'm sure that it's not like that, but it really feels that way. And i get so jealous when really short posts get so many responses while I feel pain too and wrote something long and no one cares. I know it's not like that but it really feels that way."
hate how when i am mad at people they become dead to me,404,jzf2pf,37,"i wish i could get upset like a normal person and just be like ""well this person hurt me but look at all the other good stuff they've done"" but i CAN'T. It's like instantly my brain goes to that this person is a fucking dick and I hate them so much and i never want to talk to them again. like they become DEAD TO ME and i absolutely hate it. usually i will just completely cut someone off for wronging me and it sucks like i wish my brain wasn't like this i hate feeling angry it is so overwhelming:("
"One of the worst parts of my BPD is the aspect of feeling really hopeful one day and then the next, feeling anything but.",406,bnmkzy,52,"Yesterday, I managed to pick myself up from shitty thoughts, I was feeling good and hopeful about my future.

Does anyone else get paranoia in the workplace?,407,kt3gm1,74,"I get paranoid that people don't like me, secretly talk poor of me, that im going to get fired, that I'm doing a bad job. That people who are nice to me are just pretending/faking it. Anytime I struggle, I obsess over it for days and feel negative emotions about it  Any negative comment sticks with me. Any sort of joke, I read into it and think it must be a negative thing about me disguised in humor. Sometimes I hear people talking and think its about me. Sometimes ill stand on the other side of a hallway corner after leaving to see if people are talking about me when I leave. 

For the record, there is some shit talking/gossiping  at my work and I hear it a lot about other coworkers, and that probably doesn't help."
DAE randomly start questioning if you actually even love your SO?,402,hvtbnp,63,"Sometimes I’ll start thinking I’m not even in love with my boyfriend at all, and I’m actually just obsessed with him and extremely codependent. He gives me a reason to live and to be somewhat happy and I feed off of it, it feels like I’m just a leech and am using him for my own benefit. 
I don’t know if I even know what love is/feels like and I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt it, or if that was just me getting a rush from the way a person makes me feel. He’s aware of this and it makes me feel like a bad person. I have problems believing that he loves me, so I couldn’t imagine what it’s like hearing it come out of your partners own mouth that they aren’t sure about their feelings for you."
Bpd things I miss about being in a relationship,407,hl9ldp,72,"- falling in love before the first date
- being naiively loyal and committed before there's even a relationship
- becoming obsessed after the first date
- obsessively and neurotically checking my phone every 0.1 seconds for messages from him
- heart racing like crazy every time I do get a message from him
- analyzing every.single.letter and finding alterior motives behind everything he says and does
- going home after dates to daydream (maladaptively) about .. him
- feeling on cloud 9 after dates
- feeling fucking awful after dates
- being totally obsessed and wanting to completely immerse myself in the relationship but holding back majorly for fear of being clingy

- moulding myself so I can be exactly who he wants me to be

Anyone feel like their life is just a constant trade-off between self destructive habits?,406,m8kkib,35,"I don’t know what the point is in trying to work on myself anymore because the moment I focus on bettering myself in one way, I go off the deep end in another. Leave a toxic relationship, cope by drinking every night. Quit drinking every night, turn to speed to be more productive. Quit speed, get depressed and start self harming. Quit self harming, start spending excessive amounts of money and time on a new hobby/obsession. Realize that leaving my toxic ex only made me worse, then proceed to get back with him for unhealthy validation.

It’s like I constantly create a state of chaos for myself in order to avoid dealing with the inner turmoil and confusion and fucked up self image that comes with BPD. Which fucking pisses me off because at the same time that’s literally ALL I WANT TO DEAL WITH so I can figure out how I’m supposed to live life and move on with it. 

I’m 26 and for the last 8 years I’ve been living a giant cycle of this shit yet consciously wanting and trying to get better at the same time. I so badly just want to be able to worry about normal people problems like debt and school and not have to constantly analyze myself and my inconsistencies and wonder who the fuck I am or how I truly feel or what I’m actually thinking 24/7. 

Ah, what a life.."
Does anyone else always start feeling resentful toward their SO/FP because you feel like they aren't capable of loving you as intensely as you love them?,407,m5w1mx,39,"Like, obviously I know how ""normal"" people are supposed to feel in relationships. I know that it's normal to feel attracted to other people even if you are in a monogamous relationship with one person, and that doesn't diminish your love for them.

So why is my brain incapable of finding anyone else attractive when I'm in a relationship with someone? Why am I so consumed with my FP? Even people I found attractive before my new SO/FP came along. I stop caring about anything or anyone else besides them. I can objectively take myself out of the situation, know that what I'm feeling is abnormal and harmful for myself and everyone else, but I just can't stop myself from feeling that way. 

To make matters worse, I'll start feeling resentful and jealous like always, because I'll start feeling like *I'm* not good enough-- that if I were better (smarter, more interesting, more attractive, more talented) my SO/FP would obviously feel as obsessed and infatuated with me as I am with them.

And sometimes, instead of wanting to get better and to use skills I've learned in therapy, I almost wish I could find someone as unhealthily obsessed with me as I am with them. My brain will literally trick myself into believing that my love is somehow ""purer"" or some bullshit, and that it isn't just a symptom of my BPD."
"DAE talk ""to themselves"" a lot?",402,gyknma,73,"I spend a lot (meaning even few hours) of my free time at home having conversations with ""imaginary"" people. For instance, I'm going to get psychological examination next week and I just spent an hour pretty much saying all I want to tell the doctor. I had her ask questions in my head and answered them out loud.
 I was doing some small chores but I also just sat down and.. talked. 

I do this a lot, simply because I enjoy it and it helps me sort through my thoughts. I don't see it as something I need to ""fix"" but I was wondering if anyone else does it? It can be about things at work or new writing ideas... 

Maybe I'm just hitting the ""crazy cat lady who lives alone after her husband died 20 years ago"" phase way too soon? :D

And to answer the obvious question: yep, I have close to no friends (because I suck at responding and spending time in groups woohoo)"

‘Loving Me Is Super Easy’- The truth behind a BDP romance,405,ep9k77,42,"
Loving me is super easy,
Hold me close and NEVER leave me, 
Kiss my lips and stroke my face, 
But then back off and give me space.

Loving me is really clear, 
I’ll interpret all your love as fear, 
I’ll let you down and fade away,
And then insist I’m here to stay.

Loving me is always fun, 
Except the fear you’re gunna run,
You’ll get bored and drift along,
To a new girl who could do no wrong.

Loving me is very cute, 
I see us in a dress and suit, 
But in my head you’re never keen,
I don’t feel heard or loved or seen.

Loving me is pretty stable, 
But most days I just don’t feel able,
You dote on me and so you should,
Or else I’d feel misunderstood!

Sigh... 

Loving me is a massive lie,
You think I’m great (I don’t see why),
I care too much but not at all,
‘Cus you’re a king and I’m a fool.

Does anyone else re-read texts they received over and over again.,404,elbaoo,53,"Just like the title says, does anyone else re-read messages/screenshots/texts they’ve received before.  Even if I have read them a 1000% times I will still read them over and over and not delete them. It’s like obsessive. I can almost guarantee I can word for word recite them but I can’t let go. I think the main reason being that the messages were probably super sweet and things aren’t like that anymore."
anyone else debating on never having kids bc of your mental illnesses?,406,e12gy9,111,"i’ve always wanted to have a big family bc mine is dysfunctional and trash and i want to give them everything i didn’t have in a mother. i’m just scared i can never have kids bc even if they grow up in a stable home, i would feel so terrible if i passed down my BPD or BP. adoption is always a thing i’ve been open to but it’s also like, what if i’m too emotional for them? what if my way of thinking harms them in some way? it’s just ahhhh, so much to think about."
I stopped self harming,399,m86zbt,30,Hi I just wanted to come on here and say this because I dont really have anyone to be really open with anymore and I was really proud of this. I havent self harmed in a month. One of the main reasons i was hurting myself was to repent for hurting my ex girlfriend.

I hate being able to read tone.,403,jw7h4m,50,"I officially hate knowing how people feel by just listening to their tone, or reading into text messages. Like, I’d much rather be completely oblivious to people’s feelings unless they literally SAY “I’m upset” or whatever. Better that than thinking I made my girlfriend mad because she’s not ending sentences the right way or sighing or something and then having the world’s dumbest breakdown over it because some misunderstanding over a video game (literally hilichurls in Genshin Impact) means she’s going to break up with me. I hate overreacting all the damn time"
How do I prevent getting obsessed with people?,405,i6namd,64,"Whenever I get infatuated with someone new, I don’t notice it’s happening until it’s too late, but now that I’m more aware of bpd I’m realizing it’s happening with my manager at my new job. We’ve hung out a few times and are friends and stuff, but in the back of my mind, she’s always there. It’s not like I’m in love with her or anything because that’s just not what’s up, it’s that stupid thing my brain does where I latch onto people and build fake conversations and scenarios in my head. I don’t want that."
Today my “mask” slipped and I genuinely didn’t notice until my boss’s boss pulled me aside,405,f9139h,31,"So I work in a fairly small work setting; I work with only 4 other people. 

Usually, I can do whatever I want without being noticed because I’m so good at maintaining my duties. 

Today, like many other days, I cried at my desk for a few seconds just to let out the stress I’ve been carrying for a few weeks now. My therapist recently opened up their own practice, which doesn’t accept my current insurance, and my replacement therapists’ copay had risen to the point where I can’t afford it so I don’t have access to therapy anymore. 

I didn’t think it would be obvious until today. I thought crying periodically was normal. My boss’s boss has access to all the cameras at my job and apparently today she saw me crying at my desk for a few minutes and immediately pulled me aside into a conference room to ask if I was okay. 

Because I immediately confess anything to any authority figure ever, I told her exactly what I was crying about, which she needed a little more context to understand so I ended up telling her everything behind my reason for crying today. She was unbelievably understanding and empathetic with me, however after the situation ended (which was at the end of the workday as our discussion became very long) I felt embarrassment and shame for telling my boss about my personal life- specifically all of the problems I have. 

She was very receptive and respectful, she never interrupted me once and listened to everything I said. She comforted me when I cried. 

Now that I am at home I am tortured by this interaction. I am afraid that she will think I am not a competent worker or that I’m “messed up” and need a lot of help. I can’t shake off the heavy feeling of shame from opening up to her, even though I know that she cared a about everything I had to say. 

Why am I completely overwhelmed with shame? As if I’m acting and I don’t deserve help even though everything I said was completely true? Why do I feel so utterly undeserving of help?

I hope I am not alone in this :("

Does anyone else's bouts of suicidal ideation feel fake afterward?,404,ay46ms,38,"I have moments almost every day where I feel completely suicidal that last anywhere from an hour to three hours. I'll search out pills, fantasize/plan about overdosing relentlessly, cry, the works. I'm actually really concerned for my safety during these times. But then it'll pass and i'll be as normal as a lonely someone with BPD is. I know that it feels extremely real and suicidal in the middle of the events, but afterward, it just seems like I'm faking it because i'm so normal and not depressed. Does anyone else get like this? Do I make any sense? I feel like I'm exaggerating it and when I think about going to inpatient for help, I doubt myself because I'm not constantly depressed."
"""Wow, that's intense. Do you have someone close who you can talk to about this?""",401,aq692i,91,"Umm... I thought that's what I was doing, but now I feel kind of stupid. Guess I won't try that again.

Edit: hey, just to clarify a couple things. I'm seeing quite a few comments along the lines of ""don't treat people like emotional dumpsters, you need a therapist for stuff like that, you're making them feel burdened"".

I hear you loud and clear, but I'm talking more about normal just sharing what you are going through with your friends. I'm learning that not all friends want that, and I understand, but it's still tough to hear when it's a pattern. 

If you have any specific advice, I'm open to hear it, but please be careful how you word things. This is a mental health subreddit, so I'll give you 2 guesses as to how I'm doing emotionally.

Edit 2: I hate doing edits but felt the need to clarify this after one specific comment. After my acquaintance/friend person said this, I remained kind to them. I don't dislike them AT ALL and don't judge them. I respect they have boundaries. I simply thought we had a different relationship, which if you have BPD, I'm sure you can relate to. Please don't think I am here to blame or complain about how evil people are. I just thought this subreddit would understand that feeling of making this mistake. "

Everyone thinks that my issues are a choice, that I choose to be this way, but believe me if I can stop being suicidal at the drop of a hat I would be, but I can’t help it and nobody understands that they can’t simply talk me out of my disorder. 

I’m just so so angry because everyone tells me I’m a bad person, and honestly I’m not sure that I’m not a bad person at this point."
Has anyone here heard of the term “Orchid Child”?,398,inz16a,33,"I came across an NYT article a couple weeks ago about sensitive children. I know they are just random terms, but I loved the floral metaphor that they used to categorize children with different sensitivity levels because it adds credence to the fact that a variance in sensitivity is biological and natural. 

> *”People fall roughly into three groups: highly sensitive, whom he calls “orchids,” which are beautiful flowers that need very particular environments to thrive; hardy “dandelions,” which can grow virtually anywhere; and a middle group — the largest — “tulips,” which fall somewhere between the two extremes of the sensitivity scale.*

> *”The idea is not that one is better and one is worse,” Dr. Pluess explained, “but that these are different personalities, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses.” ... “It is important to communicate consistently to the child that their sensitivity isn’t a problem, that it’s a strength so that they can develop a healthy sense of what they can do well.”*

No one looks down on an orchid for needing a specific environment and structured routine to thrive, no one solely blames an orchid for not living up to its potential. If it starts to lose flowers and turn limp, we accept that it’s probably the environment and that it may need more attention/care from its caregiver. 

I wish this kind of thinking was around when I was a kid, that not every child needs/can assimilate to the same style of teaching, feedback, socialization etc, and that being sensitive is neither a negative or positive.

"I was diagnosed with BPD at 19, and I made it to the other side. I’m 32 and have been genuinely happy and OK for years now.",403,9evbh7,42,"When I was in he middle of my hardest periods I was always looking for any sparkle of hope that there may be an end to my dark feelings. 

I’m writing this for anyone who’s in need of some hope. I really don’t mean to offend any of you. I feel so much love and empathy for everyone in this sub. 

I did a year of Linehan DBT and years of weekly 1:1 psychotherapy. I learned how to nurture and enjoy relationships that were healthy for me, randomly found a sport I genuinely enjoyed, moved to another country, and slowly grew into a happy, balanced, relaxed woman.

Sometimes life gets hard again. It’s not that everything is fine all the time. It’s just very normal. The therapy has taught me how to deal with hardship so I usually snap out of it sooner or later.

I’m so incredibly happy that I survived and didn’t give up.

I hate that I get to attached to literally any woman who showns me an ounce of care. Catch me getting attached to a check-out worker who calls me darling lmao,396,izac5y,44,"And then of course this leads to me getting attached to many people, analysing their behaviour, over reacting and using my poor coping skills. help lmao

but for real I started group DBT therapy a few weeks ago so here's hoping. I am in normal individual therapy too...so I'm working on it.

But is anyone else like me? Attached so so so easily? I'm literally talking one pet name. Because it happens so much I can usually control myself outwardly, but not inwardly. 

Childhood emotional neglect etc. obviously play a part, I didn't really get affection or hugs etc. as a child and it's definitely showing itself as an adult!"
Anyone else only comfortable with other fucked up people,395,igo43y,44,"I don't think I can date people without mental illness, I'd feel too burdensome and inferior. My entire life is shaped by years of neglect and abuse. I dont know how to interact with people who haven't had meltdown after meltdown, or who don't get that I'm clingy because I am so deprived of affection that I can't help but seek more and more. I am so insecure in relationships and I don't think neurotypicals could even begin to comprehend it or be okay with it. Of course I'm trying to avoid toxic behaviors, and try to communicate my problems and set clear boundaries, but I think I'd be far too stressful for most people. 

Even then, talking to people with similar issues, I still feel inferior, and I still expect them to ""wake up"" and walk away at any given moment. It's rough, but I've finally come to the conclusion that I still deserve love/happiness, even if I'm a work in progress, and heartbreak is normal.

Edit: thanks for the awards! Just returning from getting validation from my mans, who obviously is a lil fucked up, lol"
I hate living with this level of emotional reactivity,397,honqvy,42,"*small tw I think*

I wish I could just react to things like a normal fucking person instead of blowing everything out of proportion.

I just finished writing the first draft of a script and was proud of it so I showed my dad and he said it's good but I might want to work on some of the dialogue, and of course that spirals into me crying about how useless I am and how I'm just going to end up hanging myself from a tree someday because I'll never amount to anything.

It's not that I don't want feedback, and the feedback I got was constructive but I just manipulated the situation and made both him and myself feel awful.

I'm so tired of living like this. Whenever I'm sad it turns into me wanting to die and whenever I'm angry I get almost homicidal, I just want to experience emotions like a normal person. I fucking hate having this disorder."
I can feel love for other people but I can’t feel the love they have for me,397,dwz9iw,30,"I don’t know how else to say it. I can feel love for other people in my life, but no matter what even though I know it’s illogical sometimes, I don’t believe anyone loves me. I don’t feel the love anyone says they have for me. I always think they’re lying or it’s just going to be temporary. It’s a combination of my BPD and past relationships/friendships that’s giving me this problem. I want to be able to believe it when my boyfriend says he loves me. I want to feel his love for me without sitting there always thinking otherwise in the back of my mind. It makes me feel so bad because he could do everything for me and I just still would be skeptical and preparing myself for the worst. But I love him though. It just sucks. I don’t know if anyone else feels this way."
"""Do I really love this person or do I just enjoy the attention and care I receive from them?""",400,cr7ed3,30,My constant thought. It really sucks to not know how you really feel and what love is or if you'd still be with the same person if you didn't have bpd :/
"I'm seeing a LOT of suicidal posts, just wanted to say a few things",399,a9ilkh,67,"the holidays are hard. this disorder doesn't make it easier. many of us are struggling and feel hopeless with this event on top of the weight we already bear every single day. 

I'm here to say to you all that I'm on the other side of things. I am no longer suicidal. I haven't self harmed in years. I don't abuse alcohol or pills. I have been single for a year, I'm not sleeping with people constantly, I'm not starving myself, I'm not going through episodes every day. 

getting better is possible. We don't get cured but the symptoms can be so muted that you forget you have BPD. You'll hit snags but it's manageable with DBT skills. It won't derail you.

You KNOW you are trying your best, love hard, see beauty in this world and want to do better. You hope for a better life. You can HAVE that better life where you don't recognize yourself anymore because you aren't self destructing every 4 seconds. 

Dedicate yourself to recovery. Learn about limerence, codependency, attachment theory, and eat sleep and breathe DBT. Get to therapy, get to group, see a psychiatrist and adjust your meds if you're still spiraling. Learn how to soothe your inner child. Parent yourself the way your parents should have. 

Remind yourself why life is worth living. Remember all the hard work you've done to stay on Earth so far. You have survived so much. It is tiring. But it is noble. 
You can help others who struggle like you. 

Journal. Simple self care like showering, drinking lots of water and walking outside. take a nap. If you're manic, dance or sing to something. Keep going until you're tired. 

Killing yourself won't solve the problem. It is costly, you will cause loved ones irreversible pain for years and years and years and then you will be forgotten, never accomplishing what you could have. Never becoming better, never sharing the love you wanted to, never seeing loved ones grow up and get married, never finding a healthy relationship yourself and feeling genuine love, why throw that away for temporary pain? Die old, die having tried your very best with love all around you instead of alone and in pain. 

please decide to kill the beast/demon/disorder. Kill that voice that splits on you and tells you you're worthless and awful. Get mad at your bpd. Make it your bitch. Get a PhD in BPD and fill your arsenal with so many tools and ideas that the BPD is then the one struggling. 

Guys I am so far from where i once was. And I have still so far to go -- but I'm no longer in pain. It is only up from here for me. It is time to achieve my dreams, the things BPD took from me. 

I love you all. Remind your other pwBPD pals they too deserve to be here. We all deserve to love and live the way wish to. Stay on Earth to change it for the better. Christmas is just a few more hours. You've got this. "
"DAE give themselves a lot of tasks, which are actually way too much to handle, but you feel like a failure if you don‘t do every single one of them?",400,jywvmk,23,"This actually isn‘t about me, but about a friend. I‘m worried about her overworking herself, and I already asked if there‘s anything I can do, but she said no, so I wanted to ask if anyone else does or did this, and maybe has some kind of way to deal with it. I don‘t wanna be the kind of person, who forces their help on somebody else, but idk I‘ve been sending her stuff from this sub lately, and it‘s probably more helpful to listen to people who go through similar stuff."

Someone shows me the tiniest bit of love and care and then I'm suddenly imagining having a life with them and stupid things like that. I'm not even attracted to them? And I feel like they must feel the same way about me...even though truthfully I don't believe I'm attractive to anyone? How does this happen? How does my brain work lmao.

"I’ve finally made some progress, and I can’t really keep friends so I want to share it with you, people who’ll understand.",396,j9lkwu,45,"I finally got a job. A full time job. I’m crying from happiness. It has been a hard past two years after being diagnosed with BPD to find a job that fits me, as well as one in general thanks to COVID. I’ve had such bad anxiety and stress from being unable to support myself, and my mental health was getting so bad I was recently considering unhealthy coping mechanisms. I will be working as the manager so everyday I will be alone, which means I don’t need to make relationships with other coworkers, and that is such a relief for me so I don’t get anxiety about coming off strange or weird when I go through my strong bursts of mania and start dancing or start jittering or am completely hyped up doing ridiculously strange things or just talking to myself. I won’t have to suffer keeping myself calm, because it’s just me. This is the perfect job for me, because it also includes one of my hobbies but not in the way it will ruin the hobby for me. I’m so happy, things are finally looking up for me after the hardest two years of my life with my mental health."
The cat and tin foil: an analogy for hypersensitivity,390,g47njk,28,"I was trying to explain to my SO why I sometimes get mad or sad out of, to her, seemingly nowhere. I've been trying to explain how things like raising her voice or speaking in a certain tone upset me but she never seemed to understand until I brought up this one.

Say you're eating food with your cat on your lap, when you're done eating you decide to wrap up your leftovers but as soon as you start wrinkling the tin foil your cat shoots from your lap and scratches you.

The first thing to naturally feel is that the cat just wronged you. All you did was grab some tinfoil and now your legs are bleeding.

But did you take into account that cats have extremely sensitive ears? To them that aluminum foil  sounds like thunder and it can cause them immense distress suddenly being bombarded with a noise like that.

The cat didn't choose to have sensitive ears and you didn't choose to almost deafen him, so it's not useful to be mad at it nor yourself. The only thing you can do is try to be aware of the fact that his ears are sensitive.

I hope the analogy makes sense to you guys. I just thought I would post it since it's been a long time and it's part of me learning to understand my progress."
"Life Hack: If you start to argue with your FP, hold hands or hug each other the entire time to prevent splitting.",396,dze34q,44,"You have to do this BEFORE you feel anything negative. Otherwise you don't want to do it. So look for signs where you guys are starting a debate. Ask to hold hands or sit on their lap or be hugged the whole time.  It helps simmer down the situation being physically comforted/reminded that they still care and since it feels good to be in their arms, it reminds you that YOU still care about them too. 

Another tip: Make a rule to take turns talking, without interruption. After one finishes their turn, take 10-30 seconds staring into each other's eyes and have a moment of silence. It's basically like deep breathing, but for arguing."
DAE feel they have to leave their partner before their partner leaves them first? Abandoning someone feels more in control than being the one who is abandoned and going crazy about it.,398,dhsa0m,68,"And does anyone ever find it hard to accept or believe their partner really loves them? If I have one more big BPD episode my partner may leave me and a part of me wishes they would so I wont be resposible for hurting them any longer.

I think i will really grow old alone if i even survive that long. Today is a beautiful day and I wont even mind if my life just ended suddenly, it's just too tiring to ride this rollercoaster of thought and emotions, juggling having a semi functional life and making relationships work AND pretending i'm normal and not about to destroy everything with an emotional crazy breakdown."
A message From a BPDS/O to everyone here...,391,apje68,132,"I recently joined a sub for significant others of those with BPD.

I’ve seen so much disheartening posts and negative perspective from others in the same boat as myself - loving someone with BPD.

I wanted to come and share this post here because I realized in reading through that sub, riddled with so much pessimism, that each person posting there has or currently does play a major in  the life of someone who themselves has been diagnosed with BPD.

I know learning to live with someone who has BPD is a lot of work and learning how to effectively love someone with BPD is a life long mission that I’ve decided to accept as my own.

If you have BPD and are working towards understanding your own mind and putting in effort to learn yourself and your triggers...I want you to know that you are doing YOUR part.

If you struggle discerning whether or not your BPD is spurring an emotional episode or what your body is telling you is true and your emotional response is appropriate for the situation - you undoubtedly are feeling an intense internal pressure not many can comprehend. 

I want you to know that pressure itself reflects your heart of self awareness. Letting yourself feel they pressure, no matter how grueling reflects that YOU are doing YOUR part. It’s that same intense pressure that turns coals into diamonds.

If you are able to and making conscience effort to recognize the damage that has been done to relationships and yourself because of BPD, while often it seems like that awareness comes too late and the damage may seem irreversible, those moments of recognition themselves are a CLEAR indicator that YOU ARE DOING YOUR PART!

While learning to be the significant other of someone with BPD isn’t always fun or easy, it pales in comparison to what someone must have to experience when learning themselves to live with and love their closest someone with BPD - themselves.

YOU DESERVE loved ones who who heartily accept this truth and embody this in how they interact with you, treat you (in good times and bad), communicate with you, how they respond to any ‘outburst’ or episodes, how they embrace you, in how they accept you (in the good times and bad) and most importantly and most vitally to the future of your relationship, in how they grow themselves towards always getting better at understanding, supporting, encouraging, helping and loving you.

All of you here striving to live a healthy, balanced, controlled, loving, fulfilling life with BPD, despite your BPD and even IN SPITE of your BPD ... You are and have been working your ass off! Good for you, pat yourself on the back! Forget where you still struggle and get pumped about how far you’ve come. Start finding joy in how much the real you is beginning to eclipse the BPD-intensified  moments and seasons of your past, treasure that joy and protect it from the thief of self-doubt and devaluing.

BPD might make these things hard but I encourage you to look everyday for those moments that you can really take joy in your journey and hold onto them tight - give them all your internal attention, dialogue with yourself and your loved ones about them and when those moments are fleeting and seem too far apart, have hope that they will be back and your work IS paying off.

Don’t let others in your life steal your joy and make you feel like a piece of dirt when they stand idle, finger of blame pointed at your BPD while you move forward and becoming a BPD conqueror, one battle at a time. 

Regarding the few you hold dearest to you, please make sure they are moving forward with you, for you and for your relationship - husband, wife, friend or otherwise. 

Find people to surround yourself with who will always work to see you for you and not as a diagnosis, people who accept you even in the lows and will work to love you not how they think they should love but ask first how YOU need loved. You Deserve THAT!

If you’re doing your best, honestly your best, YOUR KILLING IT! If you’re doing your best, your putting in work, if you’re doing your best you’re becoming the writer of your own story and if you’re doing your best, for yourself and for those you love, you deserve people in your life who are doing the same!

From a husband who falls more madly in love with his amazing wife everyday, through her ups and downs, through the cycles of idealization and devaluing, through all seasons of life, a husband that is so happy to choose life with my wife and a husband who hopes always do his best and stand by his wife in the trenches of war, fighting and standing firm against everything BPD can throw at us, not on the other side, treating my wife as if she is the embodiment of BPD itself.

Keep being you, hold on and expect the same investment into your relationships with those closest that they expect from you.

Ever feel like you may have faked your illness your whole life because you're not experiencing mass symptoms at that present moment?,397,jnmebg,60,"Basically the title. I'm at a good point in my life (minus covid and work stress anyway), and I never really get any splitting or depressive episodes. I still struggle with piss-poor eating habits but I can't remember a time in my life when I didn't... I'll suddenly find myself thinking that maybe I faked it all? All the dissociative episodes, all the splitting and the anger bouts and just... Everything? I'm out of therapy currently (I was discharged and then had 6 weeks sick leave due to work related stress and depression so I got rereferred by my GP), but I still feel like maybe I did?

Examples really I can think of is usually the day after every suicide attempt I'm fine and all happy go lucky, and the same if I relapse back into self harming... It just doesn't phase me and I can just forget about it and move on with a snap of my fingers. I just don't understand it

Edit: wow I didn't expect this to get more than like 10 up votes and a handful of comments! I'm glad it's not just me and it makes me feel much less weird.

And thank you for the hugz as well ❤️🥰"
Is anyone else a high functioning BPD?,397,hwekqt,81,"I've struggled with severe anxiety, depression and BPD ever since my adolescence. However, I've been fortunate enough to live a relatively ""normal life"".

I'm currently studying a STEM course at a prestigious university and achieving solid grades. My physical health is in pretty peak condition. I'm not attractive by any means but I take good care of myself. I have a healthy amount of savings and a decent job. I don't have a criminal record or any substance addiction issues.

I'm truly grateful that I've been fortunate enough to not be struggling with the many challenges that many BPD sufferers commonly are. However, at the same time, I feel very far removed from my daily life. My BPD symptoms develop the most strongly when it comes to friendships and relationships, or when I am presented with any form of intimacy. As a result, I've gained a bit of a reputation among my circle for being overemotional. I've also had a few guys I met show interest in me in me until I always inadvertently reveal my emotional clinginess and unhealthy attachment habits.

I have friends I talk to everyday but I still feel so alone. I have very absent parents so I've never had anyone I could truly depend on. I try to use dating apps to ease the loneliness every few months but all they provide are superficial compliments and repetitive small conversation.

Every night when I go to bed, I feel so alone. I've had suicidal thoughts for a while now, but my friends are unaware of my condition and I can't explain exactly why I want to die. I just feel like even though my life is pretty in order and looks good on paper, I have a terrible relationship with myself and I'll never be in a healthy, committed relationship with someone else because of that fact. I set myself physical goals which I reach and realise I'm exactly the same shitty and broken person I've always been. It's just who I am and never going to change.

EDIT: Thank you stranger for gilding this post. Wishing you the best of luck in your life."
"Is anyone else sensitive to ""friendly"" shit talk?",394,frzay2,48,"My feelings are easily hurt when friends or family jokingly rag on me. I take everything super personal even when I know that for the most part they aren't being serious. 

Like, when my friends and I are gaming and when were all just chilling, messing around killing each other there's obviously some shit talk going on. And when one of them kills me and calls me bad or trash or really anything it kills me inside and makes me not want to play anymore and then I end up playing the game terribly because everything that was said is just ruminating in my head. 

How do I get over this? I want to be able to have fun but not let my emotions affect the way I play the game. Is it a confidence thing?"
DAE use sex as a way to feel wanted?,390,axmlvt,125,I truly feel sex is one of the only ways I can come to love myself. Knowing my partner loves me and desires me in that sense. I latch to sex to feel wanted. Anyone else?
Does anyone else in a relationship randomly get the urge to break up?,390,an4b6b,77,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for two years now and if he does anything, major or minor, wrong I get super unattached to him and lose all feelings of affection or love instantly. Does anyone else experience this?"
Can we talk about the double effing standards?!,397,lz02dd,70,"“You’re overreacting, what I said/did to you wasn’t that bad, it was a joke, I didn’t mean it in a bad way... it’s the intent of my actions that matters rather than their impact!!!”

“Uh, I don’t like what you just said, I don’t care if you didn’t mean to be upsetting, it’s the impact of your actions that matter, not your intentions!!!”"
There's no such thing as 'too sensitive',399,ke1vte,51,"I've been seeing a new psychologist and she said this at our last appointment.

I was telling her that I cry at the drop of a hat, and I seem to overreact to certain situations, especially if I sense or feel like I am being rejected or overlooked.

She said that all my feelings are valid. Their intensity might be 'disproportionate' to the situation, but that's totally okay. Some people feel more deeply than others. 

It's how I *react* to my emotions that makes the difference, and where the skills I learnt through mindfulness and DBT come in. Also, if I feel rejected, do I check the facts? Or do I just blindly accept the emotion as the complete truth?

This session was very validating as I've always been told how I overreact, am too sensitive, and so forth. Perhaps this could be just as validating for you."
Does anyone else get easily bothered by noise?,392,jl92we,83,Does anyone else get easily bothered by noise? Sometimes noise has no effect on me. I could have a great time at a concert. But then sometimes I hear somebody just talking on the phone for instance & I CAN’T STAND the sound of their voice. I’ve also noticed this happens more often around a particular family member.
DAE pretend to accept criticism only to feel angry and shameful on the inside,394,g5f6ff,42,"I have a really hard time taking criticism, even on the littlest things. I smile and say, “I’m so sorry, thanks for the feedback” but most of the time I want to cry and I feel resentment long after. At work I feel exhausted trying to hold it all in and pretend like I don’t want to quit on the spot when I’m corrected. It’s only a matter of time before I go to the bathroom for my 30 minute work cry."
DAE absolutely HATE the word “sure”?,389,g160ot,52,"like you ask someone if they want to do something or if they want something and it’s just “sure” like I can’t handle that word, because sure to me = “I don’t really want to but since u asked” so when I ask people if they want to do things with me like play video games and they’re like “sure” it makes me feel so insecure and as if I bothered them, “sure” is too in between for my black and white thinking. I need a yes or no."
PSA: Please stop using the term “mania” to describe symptoms of BPD,388,gv5otu,131,"I originally posted this as a reply to another post on here but it is such a regular source of frustration that I decided to make a separate thread.

Please stop saying you are having a “manic episode” because you are obsessing over something or have more energy than usual or did something impulsive. BPD doesn’t involve mania. Mania is a specific psychological phenomenon that is a distinct symptom of bipolar disorder. If you experience even one episode of hypomania or mania, you qualify for a bipolar diagnosis. It is possible for the two disorders to coexist in an individual, but if you are experiencing mania, you should not be attributing it to BPD.

I get the desire to label feelings like obsessive hyperfocus as “manic” (I used to do it too) but it’s inaccurate and misleading to use the term this way. It creates confusion that ultimately does a disservice to both individuals with BPD and those with bipolar (the disorders are already commonly misdiagnosed as one another and the average person can’t properly identify the difference between them).

Life of Pi and BPD,386,cnan0w,21,"I'm reading Life of Pi (Yann Martel) and came across a pretty good description of BPD in the way he talks about being at sea alone on a lifeboat. 

""The worst pair of opposites is boredom and terror. Sometimes your life is a pendulum swing from one to the other. The sea is without a wrinkle. There is not a whisper of wind. The hours last forever. You are so bored you sink into a state of apathy close to a coma. Then the sea becomes rough and your emotions are whipped into a frenzy. Yet even these two opposites do not remain distinct. In your boredom there are elements of terror: you break down into tears; you are filled with dread; you scream; you deliberately hurt yourself. And in the grip of terror- the worst storm- you yet feel boredom, a deep weariness with it all. 

Only death consistently excites your emotions, whether contemplating it when life is safe and stale, or fleeing it when life is threatened and precious.""

Just wanted to share since sometimes BPD is hard to explain/express and this seemed to really capture the emotional ups and downs and how quickly it changes."
A poem that helps me a lot.,390,8zq9mj,16,
"DAE ignore/avoid other people when you're upset, in attempt to make others notice you're upset?",390,aadpqx,53,"i do this a lot more than i'd like to admit... i close myself off to other people in hopes that they'll recognize i'm upset and talk to me about it. i guess when i do this it's to see if they truly ""care"" about me. i know it's bad to do this b/c no one can read my mind and tell that [x] is upsetting me, but i can't stop myself from doing this; it's become a habit of mine. "
DAE want bad things to happen so they can be special or have their pain justified?,390,9iipk0,47,"I know it's stupid but I get jealous of people who have hit rock bottom, who have had more severe trauma because my trauma doesn't seem bad enough to warrant the amount of pain I'm in.

DAE dissociate from their lives and personhood to the point where you don't bother having lifetime goals and aspirations?,386,jl7buh,36,"Hopefully this will make sense but hear me out. Basically, I feel like I have zero connection or characterization of who I am as a person. As such I, as I'm sure many of you have done as well, have gone through radical appearance transformations throughout my life. But I realized today that this phenomenon actually extends further into my psyche.   


Basically, I don't have any long-term or aspirational, life-time goals that are genuinely meaningful to me, because I don't really have any affinity for my life. I don't dream of a big family or a skyrocketing career or travelling the world... I just don't care what happens to me, because I don't care about me?  


Sure, while I'm alive right now, I want to feel safe and secure, I want to live in a house or something but I don't actually \*look forward\* to anything. I feel like the weight and the stress of the world overwhelms its positive aspects. Then at the same time, I feel guilt and shame for not conforming to this seemingly ubiquitous social norm.

 I don't feel like I have any connection to some personal identity... all I am is a bundle of sensitivity and turbulent emotions, constantly reacting to my surroundings. I'm always on the defence because all I know to be real is how I feel and how I feel is the only thing that defines me. 

  
And I feel like I'm constantly traumatized by these emotions, while also blaming myself for allowing myself to be subject to the whims of these emotions.   


Being awake is exhausting."
dae not want to be in a relationship because you dont like the way you act?,389,gpw1t8,41,"this is probably familiar to some people. when i get obsessed with someone i start to take on as much of them as possible. i realized recently--after not having been in a relationship for 3 years but periodically obsessing over people who ended up not liking me back, using me for their own self esteem boosts, or just....not being sexually compatible--that 

if i'm super into a person i really do worship them. every decision i make, from how i dress to what music i listen to to what food i eat, becomes a question of, ""would [x] approve? would they like this?"" 

i have to consciously keep myself from doing a milder version of this with my friends. it's hard not to take everything that everyone says and has ever said to me to heart lol. but it gets so much worse when i think i'm into someone and i act horribly and mold my life to what i think they want.

i dont like that and i dont want to be in a relationship like that ever. idk."

Anyone else host elaborate conversations in their head in the off chance it may happen in the future?,388,dkbevs,57,"I’m not really sure if I’m wording this the way I want to, but recently I’ve noticed that I (very frequently) have intense conversations in my head with real people in my life. Conversations with coworkers, family, friends, etc. as if we were  right there in person. Things that I want to talk about but will most likely not get the chance to talk about. Sometimes they’ll get really intense and emotional and I’ll end up crying as if I was actually having the conversation, so if the conversation ever does happen, I’ll be emotionally prepared to handle it. Most of the conversations are really important things, usually about my health, my horse, my future, my education. I’ll notice that I sometimes just sit there for a while playing out a scenario in my head and completely miss out on the reality passing around me. Do other people do this? Or is this just a me thing that isn’t normal?"
"anyone else constantly crave intimacy, only to be repulsed by it when it actually happens?",388,abmn6f,43,i spend like 100% of my time wishing i was kissing someone but then when it happens in real life i'm disgusted and want to die :/ it's such a pain in the ass.
"My ""Deciding Which DBT Skill To Use"" Cheat Sheet",389,a352i9,47,"I don't know about any of you, but I often have a difficult time deciding which DBT skill(s) to use for different situations, especially when I'm in distress or dysregulated. I made this sheet for myself that I can refer to during those times, and I thought I would share it here in case any of you struggle with the same. This is just my personal list so feel free to modify it to fit your needs. 

I have it categorized by types of dysregulation: emotional, interpersonal, behavioral, cognitive, self, and physical. I also have categories for ongoing skills, skills to reduce vulnerabilities, and skills to build a life worth living. I'll give a brief explanation or some examples of each below. 

* **Ongoing:** Skills that I want to incorporate into my daily life that I ultimately see as becoming a part of my way of living rather than here-and-there skills use. 
* **Building a Life Worth Living:** Skills that I see as building my character and quality of life, and increase my well-being in the long-term. 
* **Reducing Vulnerability:** Skills that I want to incorporate both on a daily basis and as needed in order to reduce my vulnerability to emotion mind. 
* **Emotion Dysregulation:** Intense reactions and emotions, mood swings, anger, difficulties returning to a state of equilibrium after experiencing an intense emotion.
* **Interpersonal Dysregulation:** Unstable relationships, idealization/devaluation, difficulties arising from having a FP, fear of abandonment, feeling misunderstood.
* **Behavioral Dysregulation:** Impulsivity, suicidality, self-harm, lashing out, shutting down.
* **Cognitive Dysregulation:** Paranoid thoughts, dissociation, cognitive distortions, intrusive thoughts.
* **Self-Dysregulation:** Difficulties with identity, feelings of emptiness or boredom, self-hatred.
* **Physical Dysregulation:** Having a panic attack, intense physical discomfort, uncontrollable crying.

Pets & BPD,386,lejocl,76,"a few days ago i had a massive breakdown after self-destructive behaviours led me to lose 2 of my closest mates, and the respect of every other friend i have/had. along with this, i lost my newly developing FP. i cried and lay in bed imagining all the ways i could end it all and felt like i that was the only thing i could do to fix things, as i can’t undo what i have done and mend the relationships i broke, as much as i wish i could.
anyway, i’m having this breakdown and my puppy just comes up and starts licking my face, brings me his fave toy and then brings me a treat he had hidden. and then i cried harder because “how could i leave him?”  because i must be his FP? 
i’ve had FP’s leave, but i understand why they left. it hurts no less but i understand. if i left my puppy forever he wouldn’t understand, he won’t understand why his FP left. 
i felt guilty for wanting to leave when i have this sweet little angel depending on me and loving me, and i think he’s why i’m still here today. i hadn’t felt so low and so alone as i did on this day, i had panic raging through me. but my little baby just knew how to make it better.
dogs are too good for this world.
too good for me. forever grateful 💓"
"Today I said to myself ""It's just your brain that makes you think that"" for the first time",388,kocsxx,14,"it's something that I've often heard but never believed. I always just trusted my thought whether it was bad or not. Sometimes when someone brings a little positive to my life and I think about it, like just about someone saying something I might like I feel like I am falling in love intensively. This is stupid. I finally have a bf who makes me happy and my head still thinks that just someone who makes me feel safe is my soul mate. It doesn't make any sense. It happened to me again today and I remembered that it was just my head that made me believe that this person was for me. This is not the case at all. Sometimes people are just nice and that doesn't mean anything. So soon after, I stopped thinking about it. And that helped me a lot."
Every time I get downvoted I want to delete my account,393,awtisi,67,"Or worse, just kill myself altogether. I get so angry and I feel really rejected and unwelcome and like an outsider whom nobody likes. I am well aware of my overreaction regarding this. Just wanted to get it out there."
I keep oversharing :(,387,mikria,50,"I keep oversharing things way too fast.  
Talking about things that I don't want to talk about.  
It just happens.  
And when I meet someone I fully engage into the conversation with things that are a little sensitive. Like Trauma or whatever. I want to keep it to myself but it's like a thing that keeps on happening and I hate it. How the hell do I stop? :("
Obsessing over people?,389,k5rjxr,115,"I can’t stop thinking of someone who I’m no longer friends with, no longer likes me, and I no longer talk to at all. I haven’t talked to them in like 6-7 months. I’m so tempted to message them because im sad and lonely and I do kinda miss them but I know I shouldn’t. There’s another person I feel the same way about, and it’s driving me insane. Will this ever go away?"
Does anyone else just forget what you were mad about?,389,jthlrn,36,This has been happening to me lately but never happened before :( I get super mad about insignificant things and then I just forget what was I mad about! It's horrible!
Does anyone else feel that sex determines their self worth,389,gqfzc6,77,I feel that sex is the closest I’ll ever get to love. When I have sex I feel a touch of romance and I start to idealize the person and they end up leaving. It sucks because I really just want to be loved. But I feel that sex is the only thing I’ll ever be good for and that’s all that people will like me for.
does anyone else get a crippling fear that theyre faking everything for attention subconsciously?,385,ghh9ky,55,"i'll start to think about how to bring up some problem im having to someone and then i'll start to tell myself that i must be faking it for attention because theres no way someone has this many problems and everything piles up. i start to think that everyone thinks im crazy or will think im crazy if i tell them so i automatically want to take back everything ive ever told them. i dont know if this is just a me problem but ive had this problem for as long as i can remember. yet at the same time, i feel as though no one listens to me or understands me truly. like i dont feel like they see what i go through. but i dont fully tell them, so how could they? anyway, was wondering if anyone else feels this or if its just the way my brain likes to torture me!!"
My (28f) mom just saw self harm scars on my arm by accident during a video call.,388,mfypd9,69,"She said ""what are those marks on your arm? Have you been cutting yourself like a 13 year old?""

When I was 13, with scars, she asked ""when will you grow up and act your age?""

To this day, she says I dress like a child, act like a child, etc. Now Im almost 29, still self-harm, and constantly struggle with feeling like a child trapped in an adult body. I'm really feeling hurt by how she acted, and angry too. I know I should just let it go, but it hurts.

Edit: thank you all for your kindness and suggestions! I am sorry I dont have the energy to respond to you all, but know I am reading and listening to everything. It helps :/"
I feel like I don’t exist when I’m physically alone,386,lnnhhp,56,"It’s a strange sensation that I’ve recently become more aware of.

I’ve been spending more and more time alone and isolated from others and sometimes I feel like I’m not real.

Without others there to spend time with or validate my existence, there is this strange sense of what the hell am I doing?

My actions seem meaningless. Pointless.

I don’t know how to express it in other words.

I know this is a dangerous way of thinking and I’m striving to actualize me to myself by pursuing things I enjoy and continuing to create things ie for my business or for fun etc.

But still. It was an interesting observation I realized a few days ago.

EDIT: wow thanks for silver! It’s nice knowing I’m not alone in this even though I feel alone. Hugs to all my
BPDs. Love you guys!"
I graduated from my DBT group today,389,dyir67,45,And i enrolled right back in it lmao tf 😭
I just want to say Sorry.,390,d47pxj,63,"I work in the mental health field, and I want to give the biggest ""sorry"" to anyone who has ever tried to access services and felt judged based on your diagnosis. 

I am so so sorry. There are individuals who are so jaded and make assumptions about a BPD diagnosis, and that effects their treatment. As someone who works in the field, i have tried my very best to not be that person.

I want to let you know, there are professionals out here who support you, care about you and won't give up trying to give you the best care we possibly can. 

And I'm so sorry"
"What the fuck is even up with people who say like shit ""you're so negative, have a more positive mindset""? Do they not realize that's genuinely difficult for some people?",390,fcfztr,42,"I think that's such an insanely simplistic view of mental illness and the world in general. People are born with conditions they can't help. People get traumatized to the point where their mind is never the same as before. Telling someone to just simply have a more positive mindset is as bad as saying something like ""just try not being depressed."""
People who virtue signal about mental health issues,385,eo3iom,70,"""You are not alone"" my @$$.

There are people out there on social media who like to virtue signal about how much they support the mentally ill, how they see the value of empathizing with the lonely, depressed, and suicidal. But the moment they meet a REAL mentally ill person and shit gets real, these virtue signalers vanish. They demonize us, reduce us to convenient labels, lazy buzz words, and ignorant, negative stigmas just so that they can convince themselves that they have every reason to hate and ostracize and destroy us.

If you're a mentally ill person who has a friend or loved one who supports you no matter what, I am genuinely happy for you (nope, not sarcasm). Because those kinds of people are a RARITY."
I'm sick of being told I'm something people have to deal with,382,m3vool,34,"Like, on the one hand, I get it, I can be exhausting, but I'm working on it and I am absolutely fed up with searching for help online and the internet search results automatically assuming that I'm asking for help dealing with someone who has BPD. Every single time. Why is google collecting data on me if they cant even figure out I'm looking for results to help me, not to lessen the burden of my existence on those around me? If I google how to cope with a breakdown, I get how to cope with the horrors of having to be near someone with BPD. If I search for relationship advice from fellow BPDs I find countless articles and forums telling people how they should just leave us because we're toxic and incapable of love. I'm sick of it. I'm so sick of being treated like a problem when all I want is help with this awful thing I'm dealing with. I'm sick of even mental health websites providing information for friends and family of BPDs but not for ME myself. I'm sick of not being able to search for advice without feeling like I'm some irredeemable monster."
DAE feel like they're on the edge on insanity all the time?,386,kcq179,46,"I have to constantly anesthetize myself to keep from losing my mind. Whether it's substances, ideas, or affirmations, I'm just always gripping on to these things so tightly because the moment I let go I'm literally unable to function. 

I don't know what it is about today but nothing is bringing me down to earth. Every thought that scares me and distresses is me is running loose inside my head and I feel like I'm fucking drowning. I've been shaking and twitching uncontrollably all day, my heart is beating so fast and it feels like there's an elephant sitting on my chest. I feel like I am constantly putting a cap on all of these bad thoughts and then when I've done that for too long, it all just explodes and I'm a mess like I am now. 

Am I making sense? Does anyone feel like this sometimes? I really just need some confirmation that I can pull myself out of this one and that life isn't as horrifying as I think it is."
Is it a bpd thing or? Does anyone ever feel humiliated when told “you’re not the only one.”,385,izy12t,41,I know people mean well when they say it but to me it sounds like they’re saying “get your head out of your ass you selfish bitch.” and I don’t have any proof that’s not secretly what they mean and then I feel super disgusted and humiliated with myself ontop of battling my own junk and it discourages me from opening up again.
DAE feel like mental illness robbed them of a proper youth/teenage experience?,382,gsmw10,52,"I was listening to some songs that were really popular when I was 16 and I got reminded how I would lay in bed and cry to a majority of these songs. I was really isolated and forced to be grown up. I didn’t have those experiences of being able to rebel with friends and get in typical teenage troubles. I never got to go to parties or even build any close relationships honestly. I didn’t have any fun, I wasn’t able to let go and I never had the freedom of being able to not care. I stayed home all the time and did nothing besides listen to music and deal with situations that still effect me today. I don’t think it’s fair and I feel like I’m going to die feeling bad that I wasn’t ever allowed a normal life because I’ve had to deal with mental illness."
Anyone else close off and treat people they love like shit when they're hurting?,389,fqu8uc,29,"Like ive just been depressed and hating myself recently and it takes so much energy to be nice so I been snapping and sarcastic  at my mom for the last couple days and now she's just sad and avoiding me. Fuck I wanna go apologize to her and I know it'll be fine but I'm so sick of this pattern, I don't wanna apologize and just end up doing it again. Being vulnerable in the moment is hard so I just send out the worst vibes to get people to leave me alone when what I truly want is connection. I just have so much hate and anger in my heart and I need to release it in a healthy way :( also I judge myself so fucking hard when I'm down that I feel it just slows down any progress :( 

Can anyone relate? Any tips for letting go of repressed anger? Thanks in advance ♡"
DAE get really triggered from feeling invalidated?,385,dgiqwg,54,"If I feel like people don’t understand me or relate to me, it sends me in a spiral. Like I guess abandonment has never been a huge issue for me but moreso the idea of feeling “emotionally abandoned” where the person is still there but you feel no connection with them because they can’t understand you and you can’t understand them.

EDIT: Thank you everyone, and thank you to the person who gave me gold. Through writing a post about feeling invalidated I ended up feeling extremely validated. Hope other people felt that way too."
"Why people with borderline personality are so hard to please: New study suggests that, rather than being only sensitive to social rejection, people with borderline personality disorder are sensitive even to acceptance, so they chronically feel rejected, even when the opposite is happening to them.",381,9ne882,51,
I finally get it: no one is responsible for my feelings.,390,8k04ld,51,"I had an interesting conversation with someone today that made me pause and realize: HOLY SHIT, is this how I look like to other people when I'm spazzing out?! And is that why they react the way that they do?!

Long story short, I rejected a guy who I was considering getting to know as a romantic prospect. This started when he randomly reached out to me this morning, insisting that I did something that I didn't do in a very accusatory tone, with an entire imaginary narrative on WHY I did what I did. And how dare I do this thing, blah blah blah. Three things: 1) I had no idea what he was talking about, 2) I don't know him well enough for him to accuse me of any of these things, 3) he was alarmingly hostile and presumptuous. All these signs were red flags to me.

After we cleared up the situation, he apologized for what he said and how he came off. But, at that point I was over it; I accepted his apology, but let him know that I didn't think that we should continue forward. And that's when the pity party started. He didn't take this well. He went on and on about ""how women always reject him"", ""how things never work out"", how badly he feels about not getting a second chance, how he struggles with anxiety and depression, and how dare I ""not care"" about what he was sharing with me (his sadness story).

And that's when it hit me: I DIDN'T FUCKING CARE and I didn't know him well enough to - and most importantly, I didn't need to know any of this information. All I knew was that - this person, behaved in an inappropriate and alarming way. And rather than taking accountability and accepting the outcome, they were trying to manipulate me into staying by talking about their issues, pain, and sadness (none that I have control over).

And that's when I realized: ahhh, I've been him, and in those cases - my temper tantrums never worked - as his didn't. It's clear to me that now: yes, I have BPD. And it fucking sucks and is painful. But it doesn't excuse my behaviour and I'm responsible for how I manage my feelings (regardless of who triggered them). And making people feel like they aren't 'caring' for not managing MY feelings isn't right. My pain isn't special or rare; everyone suffers."
The stigma surrounding BPD is INSANE,389,j1pk3e,4," People act like we’re guilty before proven innocent.

I’ve had so many health professionals act surprised when they see that I’m capable in certain domains of my life. Some of them just can’t wrap their heads around the idea of someone with BPD not fitting their pre-conceived notions that they assume I /must/ be lying and so try to set up ‘gotcha’ traps throughout conversation. If y’all defined BPD to be a spectrum, then treat your clients accordingly. 

Then there’s friends that, despite getting to know me for a long period of time with absolutely no problems, suddenly distance themselves once I confide with them about me having this disorder. I’ve literally had it this whole time, me disclosing it isn’t suddenly going to change me. (I’ve since learned never to confide with friends, no matter how understanding they seem). 

Heck, my friend with a more socially-acceptable disorder constantly put me down despite me praising them at every imaginable opportunity. Oh but I'm the one with BPD so obviously I'm in the wrong, right?

It's exhausting."
Do you feel like you haven't lived?,386,idroqe,38,"My entire existence could be reduced to my mental illnesses and how I've avoided anything that could go wrong. 

It feels like, nothing happens to me. Nothing's happened to me. People are out there living and I've wasted at least ten years of my life using the internet and sleeping and being fucked up. 

I never try anything. It's like I don't know how to be a person. Like I'm living by inertia. I don't know how to try to be a person. I can't relate to anything because nothing has ever happened to me. I don't exist in the same.. plane of existence as the people around me. I'm just floating in a bubble, and nothing real has ever gotten close enough to pop it and make me feel or experience something."
Just sending love to everyone trying so hard right now,380,g7g79b,29,Keep on keeping on. Everyone who is striving for recovery. I’m with you. We can do it. Sending love and positive vibes to you all!
Anyone else struggle with a lack of self discipline when it comes to anything requiring effort?,381,fgckt6,48,"Only diagnosed with traits but I’m a chronic procrastinator and it’s so ruinous and detrimental. I know anyone can have this issue regardless of diagnosis but I wonder if it’s more common in people who struggle with emotional intensity and impulsivity?...

I think I’m very much geared towards seeking instant gratification. I’m so disorganised it could look like ADD to the untrained eye but I CAN plan and focus (sort of)... it’s more an issue with forcing myself to tolerate any discomfort or frustration and set limits for myself."
"At Age twenty-one, I will FINALLY be graduating with my High School Diploma...",383,axqika,27,"I am so incredibly emotional. Tomorrow we take our final exam and then Thursday is my final day of High School. 

At fifteen, I was set to graduate high school early but instead I am graduating two years late. I'm okay with this. 

Mental illness happened. I lost friends. Went through a series of unstable and toxic relationships. I was miserable and lost as all hell. 

I'm still going through a lot. I still have no fucking clue what I'm going to do with the rest of my life but I'm so damn glad to finally be done with my high school studies yet also very saddened. 

This school took me - and others in similar difficult situations - in. I met some amazing teachers. I finally made honor roll and I came to realize that I never sucked at math, I just wasn't getting the support and attention I needed from a  public school system. 

Major thanks to the guidance counselor who gave me a final opportunity to redeem myself and finally finish up my studies (I only had one math class left). 

I did find myself crashing down again, but I powered through. Life gave me no choice. I have to. 

I just wanted to share this victory with others. 

I'm not at all embarrassed to be completing my studies at 21. I understand that we all have different paths in life and for some of us it takes a while to get there. 

I did it. I made it.

I have dealt with my BPD since the age of 16. Today I passed my Master Social Work Licensing Exam. I promise to continuously challenge the BPD stigma in the field of Social Work.,387,79qkzw,22,
Obsessions,378,lj4kp3,134,"Does anyone else get like super obsessed with certain things for like days at a time? Random shit. Like currently I’m obsessed with creating a YouTube. I’ll probably never do it, but I’ve been researching, watching how-to videos like crazy, and making notes. For days. Next week it’ll be something completely unrelated like steel toed boots. Lol my life."
Does anyone else get super upset when people around them get mad/sad?,379,jm5t4h,45,"I was playing a game with my bf earlier today and I was having so much fun. When he died, he sighed, but then when he died again, he groaned loudly.

I started to get really upset and start trying to play better, but that meant taking more risks and then I started to die. I started feeling like I was failing him and getting more and more upset, and he would get angrier (though he kept saying he wasn't mad...)

I just felt like I was so sensitive to the way he was talking, his body language, his tone, maybe I was imagining that he was mad? But I just couldn't deal with it... I had to take a break from the game eventually because I was getting too upset.

And this has happened lots of times, when we play I usually just laugh when I die but when he dies he gets super upset and it puts me in a really sad mood..."
got my first downvote and spiralled into a depressive episode,384,gp6jcq,62,"Idk, I just get so sad so quickly- for literally any reason. All it takes is an unfollow, a downvote, an unseen message, and suddenly it feels like the whole world is against me. Little things cause me to question my self worth and completely destroy any self esteem I have. My whole day could be ruined by a pedestrian giving me a weird look, or realising that someone I haven’t spoken to in 3 years has unfriended me. At this point, I’m seeking validation from near strangers on the internet like my mental well being depends on it. It’s not healthy, but I can’t just turn it off, you know? Any tips/coping mechanisms? I’ve deleted instagram but my insecurities still find other mediums to haunt me- I feel like I’m running away from the problem rather than solving it.."
hearing people who dont have bpd talk about bpd makes me so uncomfortable,382,9j10p3,146,"i hate how they talk about us as if we're ""other"" somehow, as if we're aliens and are just so fundamentally different from people without bpd that figuring us out is ""wow, so fascinating"" at best and ""terrifying"" at worst. even professional psychologists talk about borderlines as if we're just infantile and have no self-awareness or empathy and are just constant drama. we're just sooo scary and incomprehensible, everything has to come with the tag line of ""if you know a borderline dont let yourself be abused!!!"". "
whats real and whats fake,381,iwq2fx,33,Does anyone else have trouble telling which emotions you should listen to? i have an incredibly difficult time making decisions big and small so i usually just resort to doing nothing.  and i literally cannot make decisions for myself because my moods fluctate so much and i will feel completely different about something a day or even a few hours later.  i just want some clarity.
Leaving this sub,386,h0wmk0,74,"I've been diagnosed with a teen version of BPD when I was 15, almost a decade ago. What followed was one in-patient stay after the other as well as a lot of medication and therapy in general.

Since I started to grow out of puberty about three years ago, my symptoms lessened. I completely changed into another person. At first I thought that I maybe beat BPD, but things got worse when I started working full-time.

I went back into my regular treatment, but nothing helped and things got worse. Then I had an epiphany. What if I was misdiagnosed back then?

So I went for a new diagnosis.

The result is that I don't have BPD, probably never had and only mirrored the behavior of my Mom, who definitely had BPD, and that I, in fact, am an Asperger or high functioning autist. 

If you were diagnosed at a young age or during puberty (puberty can last up to the age of 25) and your symptoms lessened over time (especially as a woman!) to a degree where you don't even recognize your past self, go get a second opinion. Autism is still severely underdiagnosed in women as a lot of professionals still think autism is a) mostly common in boys and b) girls show exactly the same symptoms as boys.

Nevertheless, I wish you all the best for your future! May you come to good terms with yourself and find pleasure and satisfaction in life 🌺"

I base my self worth on how attractive I am and I feel worthless,378,auto9e,64,"I've struggled with self esteem and confidence forever. Recently ive been diagnosed with BPD. ive known about my anxiety and depression for a while now, but im having issues dealing in general with BPD.

I base my worth on sexual attractiveness and fucking crumble when another woman is mentioned or around. Sometimes im extremely confident and the rest of the time I'd like to tear my own face off and feed it to my dogs. I cry when i put makeup on, i cry when i use any social media, i cry when i watch triggering shows or movies. 

I lack the ability to make and maintain friendships and i constantly feel hatred for others and then victimize myself. I honestly base it on my self esteem. I feel like I'm in a neverending cycle of ups and extreme lows and i never fucking know what i want or who i am."

BPD on Local Television Today--Dr Phil,384,a1eycq,50,"Dr. Phil aired an episode on BPD today that made me start crying.  The way he treated the afflicted teenager was so refreshing.  He called out the parents' restraint techniques, saying that mental illness still meant ""illness"" and that if she had a more tangible illness like cancer, would they still have pinned her to the ground or hit her with a belt?

And then at the end of the show, after he'd gotten the girl setup with a therapist, a life coach, and a new psychiatrist, he turned to her and said, ""I bet you were expecting to be thrown under the bus, right?""

And for the entire program, I kept waiting for her extreme rage fits and triggers to be used to chastise her. They had video evidence of her rage attacks, but he used them to point out more constructive techniques rather than shame her.

We have so much media geared around how destructive we as Borderlines are that I was floored when the show retained her dignity and offered her help.  They acknowledged the parents' frustrations but didn't let it become a gang-up session.It threatened to a few times but he'd always steer it back toward more supportive territory.  It was a very empathetic episode.

Here's the description if anyone is interested:

*Bad Parenting or Bad Teen? Who's Really to Blame?*

Dr. Phil episode (season 17, episode 55)

Just thought I'd share."
I don't want an FP anymore,384,guapcy,65,"Seriously, this is fucking agony. Hanging on every word they say, noticing every little change in tone or energy, feeling like a burden no matter how hard I try to be good to them, feeling like because they aren't obsessed with me like I am with them that I mean nothing to them and that I'm unimportant. Knowing that all these things are irrational and yet STILL it affects me to such a degree that I shut down and can't deal with my life and I'm miserable. I'd rather feel nothing for anybody. This is torture. Yet I continue to cling to people like a fucking idiot. I want to let go."
"I always feel lonely & like I really have no one, so I crave social interactions yet when I’m socializing I feel so awkward, unsure, & would rather be at home laying in bed. Wtf?",382,aazacl,58,Anyone else?
"It's fucking crazy to fully understand, acknowledge and accept that you got BPD.",382,klkf67,55,"You're a regular person, no one special. Turns out you're highly emotive, too sharp, too passionate, too loving, too extreme, too impulsive, too reckless, too self-destructive, too dettached and erratic; according to society.

This shit will stay in your head forever. Major depression will never stop. You go from ""I hate myself and I want to die"" to ""I hate humanity and I want to die"" to ""I really love this person, this person is totally worth it"" to ""you don't like me at all""  in minutes, hours, seconds. You get paranoia, psychosis or dissociation plus wanting to die when you fucking snap; and you snap frequently. You always want to be dead 24/7 because the mood swings are worse than death. You love everyone but no one loves you. This is not like schizophrenia; you retain your cognitive psyche even when out of touch with reality. You still seem coherent to some people and doctors, your illness ""isn't serious if we can have this conversation, you are somewhat coherent"" or ""you gotta stay in the hospital long term buddy"". Dude, I'm doing my best to try not to scare you, this shit is still stressing and taxing on the body, having to self-regulate 24/7. 

**And you ask yourself, what made me like this; was it the way I grew up?** And you get even madder when you answer that question. Your fucking guardians were some abusive pricks or you had no guardians at all. Just beginning from there. ""Wow I have Borderline Personality Disorder, nothing serious at all according to doctors or society; just exaggerating shit"" despite the symptoms."
Deleted the fast food apps off my phone,380,kd0s3m,47,"It's a small victory, but it's still good. Takeaways have become an unhealthy coping mechanism for me, and really impact me financially. Hopefully now I can save more money for Christmas and the new year."
Shoutout to everyone making progress that no one recognizes because you never let anyone see your darkest moments.,374,jy0gnt,13,"You’ve been silently winning battles and transforming yourself, be proud of every little step you’re making in the right direction. I see you, and I’m proud of you. Keep going on because you’ve got this, I believe in you. Please see that you deserve the world... and then give it to yourself. Keep your heads up queens/kings because that crown is slipping. :)








Edit: thank you for the awards kind strangers, I don’t expect much when I make posts like these, I’m just saying stuff that I wish someone would have told me. I guess it’s your daily reminder that if you don’t have a good positive person in your life, to be a good positive person  for someone else, afterall only you know how painful it is to be where they are at."
"My mom said something offensive to me, I voiced that her words had upset me, she acknowledged and apologized, I immediately accepted the apology, and we went on to have a nice evening together - no bad feelings.",382,ij53nw,32,"Holy shit what a breakthrough. I'd call this a progress post but I didn't really make any progress except realizing that if my mom had had always had the emotional maturity to acknowledge and apologize when she had done something wrong, I think my personality would have developed very differently. Once she had apologized, it was so easy to forgive her and let it go! Wow! 

Usually when I get upset about something I'm not able to bring it up because she'll either fail to acknowledge my feelings, refuse to accept that i'm right, or get angry and start throwing things in my face. So i end up brooding over negative feelings forever and harvesting feelings of hatred against her, and planning self-destructive ways to get ""revenge"" on her by hurting myself. If we could have had interactions like this when I was growing up I could have learned to deal with my emotions in a healthier way, instead of trying to wreck myself in order to get her to acknowledge that she screwed up as a parent. 

Fuck i'm angry just thinking about all the things she's never owned up to and how much pent up resentment I have towards her because of that.  I bet I would have been able to let those bad feelings go if she would have apologized for things. I'm quick to forgive, but i don't fucking like when people won't own up to their mistakes."
"DAE ""forget"" bad episodes /think their emotions are fake?",378,df2aqi,47,"after I recover from a bad episode, I wonder if it was actually that bad, if I was pretending to feel that way, or if it was an episode that would be recognized as such by a mental health professional (an OCD obsession/theme I have is about legitamacy and honesty). in the moment I say I'm feeling depressed/empty/paranoid etc but afterwards it's like I can't remember the episode properly, despite being able to recall thoughts and having notes that detail things like ""I couldn't get out of bed, my heart was pounding"". as if it happened years and years ago instead of just last night.

and it's difficult to know what my feelings are, how intense they are compared to past feelings since I don't remember those past feelings, which leads to health anxiety and imposter syndrome about whether I'm actually ill. yet when I describe the episode to a mh professional they say it was worse than I remember it being? like I'd rank the episode 5/10 crisis level whereas they'd say it was 9/10. 

is this what they call emotional amnesia? or is that term reserved for splitting

edit: turns out a lot of people here experience this.. did some research and from what I gather, this sort of situation is due to difficulties with whole object relations (not being able to put the past and present together, it was worded to refer to relationships but I think it applies here too.) and having some type of selective dissociative amnesia (when a person blocks out certain info associated with stress/trauma).

edit 2: thanks for the support everyone. I'm so glad my vent has helped people. last night I had a paranoid rumination episode where I was convinced people were only nice to me out of pity or that they pretended to accept me bc they want to be seen as ""good people"" and that it was a whole conspiracy and I was the only one who wasn't in on it. I took diazepam and slept it off. I woke up today feeling as I described above. really appreciate having a community to share stuff with :)"
It is MY job to make myself happy,379,anby96,24,I finally realized that I shouldn’t cling to other people and try to get happiness through them. I need to take control of my own happiness.
BPD has ruined me.,375,kq5qak,72,"I'm tired, I'm so tired of there horrifically intense emotions. I'm tired of how draining DBT is, it takes up so much time and yet I feel like I don't do enough. 
I fight for my life every single day.
I'm tired and sad and I don't know what to do."
DAE spend literally days a) hating themselves and b) replaying scenes from the past in which you were the victim/loser? DAE have literally loads of people blacklisted from their lives and it feels like the baggage is killing them?,384,atxu8r,69,"I'm just wondering because I have good days, I have good weeks, but then sometimes, no matter whether I'm rushed off my feet, or at medium or low speed, it's like I start running a second channel in my head where I basically tell myself I'm a complete write-off, and replay scenes from my past in which I play the role of a total asshole/loser/victim (different roles depending on story or my mood) for days, sometimes up to 10 days or 2 weeks max. I know I'm borderline, but I wonder if I don't have something else on top... is that depression or manic behaviour? Narcissism? It really bums me out, and it's like I'm not present in my real life anymore. I'm just going through the motions, because I'm actually completely immersed in the past, and replaying terrible scenes."
Do you hate me? Are we OK? Are you mad at me? I'm sorry.,374,aj95lo,38,Every. Single. Day.
"Anyone else really high functioning, until theyre not?",377,9saax8,51,"I am, and I hate it.

Career wise, I am driven, work obsessed, reliable, conscientious, positive, enthusiastic, innovative and perform well generally. Until I have an episode. Then I'm a damn mess. I gain weight, drink more, struggle to show up and deliver any kind of enthusiasm whatsoever. I maintain a healthy and active lifestyle until I cant and then Im lazy, eat too much, sleep tons, become depressed, jaded and cynical. Diametric opposites. 

I hate that there is no consistency. I either feel shit and spiral down or am motivated on an upwards spiral. People dont know what to think. Im literally two different people depending on what month you catch me. But the people who see me on the way up resent me and try to cut me down because when Im good, Im really good. But Im just a short step away from going back to the spiral. I always will be.

Who the hell am I? I just want some good in my life and for it to stay that way for more than just a while."
Is anyone else too self aware for their therapist or anyone else to be of any help,378,m9p7r6,56,"My therapist tells me every session how much progress I’m making and that I’m v self-aware. However, the self aware side is the only one she or anyone else (outside my family) sees. 

I feel like she doesn’t get how bad things really are and all she does is validate me even when I describe a situation in which I’m definitely the one being an  asshole. I present a “good girl” image and hide the bad even from myself.  I don’t know how to let her or anyone in on the bad because I feel like my bad is so much darker then anyone else’s. I never told her I cut myself because It feels assaultive to share something like that to another person. Not that she really needs to hear about it, I’ve pretty much stopped but still. 

I’m so self aware all the time it’s exhausting and I feel like maybe it’s stopping me from making progress in a round about way but it’s also how I manage to keep myself composed.


UPDATE
just an update in case anyone finds this later. I took the advice that was offered on here seriously and as it turns out, the only way I can really be vulnerable in therapy is to get high before hand. I don’t know if this is a good thing or not but I do feel like this was the best therapy session I’ve ever had with her and We actually made a lot of progress together. My takeaway is that Therapy SHOULD be hard. I should dread it because in therapy I should be actually reconciling the things I don’t like about myself which is painful and uncomfortable. Maybe not every session but I forgot that this is a sign of progress. 
I guess why I need weed to be vulnerable is another issue but thanks to anyone who contributed!"
i posted about feeling suicidal on social media and a friend reached out to me asking for my jobs information if there’s going to be a position opening up.,377,kmj6m1,73,lmao. that’s it. that’s the post. that’s the level of support i have in my life.
DAE hate being looked at?,375,hvjys2,53,"This feels so stupid to admit, but I HATE when people look at me. Like passing glances, eye contact, checking me out, if their eyes are on me for a second I hate it. I only being seen when it’s like in my control?? Like if I take a picture with a friend and willingly put my appearance out there. Idk how to describe it. I guess I just hate being perceived, especially in environments I can’t control my perception. I wish I was a disembodied voice or something. Absolutely hate being looked at."
My diagnosis has been the most validating thing to ever happen to me,378,gnx5d0,49,"Before my diagnosis, I would get so frustrated with myself when I’d have trouble controlling my emotions and thoughts. Seeing everyone around me seemingly doing it so effortlessly made me hate myself and question what was wrong with me. I would cry, then cry that I was crying and couldn’t stop! But now that I know that the thing making me feel so different and broken is bpd and treatable, I’m able to tell myself “It’s okay. You’re struggling with this because your bpd is making it difficult. Use your coping skills.” And I’m able to snap myself out of splitting, sometimes. I’m just beyond happy that there’s a reason and a solution. I needed to know I wasn’t defective or a bad person. I (we) may have a few more obstacles in life to get over, but we are good people. We are trying!"
DAE always feel passively suicidal?,375,ci7xwx,61,"I'm doing better atm but I've kind of clocked on that there's a sense that I always want to die and am disinterested in life. Being busy is just a distraction from that feeling rather than changing my mind on it. And when I get upset, this is why I end up getting *really* bad cos I've been thinking about suicide anyway. It's just hard when I'm thinking about if I'm recovering or not and I'm really not sure even though I do feel better in some ways."
"Is anyone else fed up of BPD being idolised on social media? It isn't a trend, this is a real life struggle.",375,l9oe82,248,"TW: Abuse 

Sorry to rant. But I am so fed up of seeing BPD glamorizing on social media. Like, I frequently see people on Tiktok and Twitter talking about their symptoms and how 'toxic' they are to their partners as if it's a good thing or something to be admired. 

It makes me so angry that people think this is trendy or makes you 'edgy'. I see multiple people in the comments, teenagers and younger saying they feel exactly the same or that they also manipulate their partners etc. It's getting so annoying and makes me so upset. I had my family member the other day tell me that she thinks she has BPD and is getting therapy, she's 14 years old. It's ridiculous and concerning that misinformation is spreading like this and teenagers think it's cool to have. I don't know about anyone elses country but in mine you often can't even be diagnosed until you're 18. 

It's so upsetting because most of us have really fucking suffered and don't want this life. Having to go through a childhood of narcissistic abuse and teenage years full of sexual abuse is not something to be desired. All of my relationships fail and I feel helpless that therapy is so hard to come by. 

I don't know if any of you get annoyed by this but it's so fucking invalidating to have something that makes your life hard every day to be admired by others. 

I'm by no means saying that people can't express themselves and their recovery in the way they want; but most of this shit is so unhealthy.

Edit: This has become a far more controversial topic than initially planned and thought so let me clear a few things up. 

The intention of this post was not to spark debate amongst people but to address a very real and serious problem that exists within multiple parts of social media. Whether you have seen this type of behaviour or not doesn't distinguish the fact that misinformation and glamorizing a serious mental illness can have devastating consequences on someone's family. 

This is, as aforementioned, particularly the case when it comes to teenagers. Who are often susceptible to influence, especially if they are lonely or in isolation. Oftentimes, BPD is not the solution or answer in these cases. Which brings me onto another point. I have not said at any point that being diagnosed under the age of 18 is an impossibility. It isn't. However, in the UK it is heavily advised against because of the developmental progress you make in your teenage years. Hell, I've been having the same symptoms since I was 13 years old. I am not by any means invalidating or minimising an experience of someone under the age of 18 who has been diagnosed with BPD at all. And I'm very sorry if it has come across that way. 

The point I am trying to get at here is, I've had someone close to me start mimicking behaviours of BPD she has learned from the internet. And this is not only her, it extends to her friendship group also. It's very sad and dangerous. By no means is BPD an exclusive 'club', but it is a very serious mental illness and should be addressed by a professional and not taken lightly. 

I hope that clears some things up.

Edit 2: 

Thank you for everyone's responses and engagement in this topic. Although I understand some people have not come across this themselves, please do not underestimate the existence of such material. This sort of stuff has been going on for a long time with a variety of mental illnesses. And I'm sure, for the most part, that we're only starting to see it more now because of the dominance of social media. 

The intention here was to express a personal viewpoint and situation that I'm in. It is absolutely okay to disagree, however, this has been something that's impacted my personal life whether you seek to disagree with this post or not. Having to defend the way I feel based on a rant regarding something that has upset me quite a lot, and that I think is incredibly important, is exhausting. So I'm going to leave it here. 

Thanks guys."
If you’re a teen in the sub I love you so much and I know how lost and scared you are. Please hang in there.,373,hi9aah,39,"
BPD sucks but being an adult has made it much easier to seek my own help and have good days. When I was a teen being trapped in my abusive home made me feel like there was no possible light that could shine through. Being controlled all of the time by my parents/abusive boyfriend/prison of a high school made me feel like there was nothing more to life than abuse. Having my bedroom in an terrible household be my only escape was agonizing and all I wanted every day was to die. Once I was finally able to leave my parents and boyfriend at the time I almost immediately found hope. I’m 22 now and I take as best care of myself as I can. I have the most amazing job, friends, cat, and partner and I did it all for myself which as a child I  NEVER thought could be possible. Anyway, I just wanted to say you can’t control your parents or your situation, ride the wave and once you’re an adult sail to shore and run like hell."
One of my manic impulses became my biggest accomplishment - Having BPD helped me get a PhD and land my dream job as a professor.,373,gv1hf4,62,"I have a tendency to go through phases/personas that are brought on by random manic episodes. I went through a phase where I wanted to become a “scholar.” I also wanted to prove all my past teachers, ex friends, bullies, and colleagues that I pissed off wrong. During this manic episode, I spent weeks obsessing over and applying to different PhD programs. I got accepted and graduated with my PhD 4 years later at the age of 28. For once, having BPD benefitted me."
I really appreciate the people who post in this sub to learn more when their friend/partner/sibling gets diagnosed with BPD,379,ek3hgh,33,Thank you for not “running” as soon as you get to know about our diagnosis. Thank you for fighting past the stigma and recognizing that we are much more than our illness. Thank you for putting in the effort to understand us better.
DAE accidentally ghost people all day?,369,arbw3a,38,"like, my friend or girlfriend will be texting me and i think that i will get back to them soon, but as time goes on i get more and more anxious about replying and i get all stuck and start avoiding my phone and getting super depressed. then they get upset at me for ignoring them, which i understand, and then i feel even worse about myself and think theyd be better off without me. i do it all the time even though i know i shouldnt. )-:


edit: thanks for replying everyone ♡ im sorry to hear so many ppl have the same problem but i feel a lot less alone. i wonder what we can do to kick this weird habit? hehe"
"I’m not a good person, I don’t blame anyone who leaves to be honest, I’d leave me too!",377,lr1vu1,52,"There’s something wrong with me, for a very long time now. I was diagnosed with BPD at a very young age, with split personality.
One side is sweet and talkative, and the other sabotages and causes trauma to everyone around me.

Once the damage is done, I try to fix it. But some things I’ve done I can’t take back.

I explain it to everyone I meet, the whole “I’ll self sabotage, I’ll push you away, I’ll press all your buttons and the ones you didn’t even know you had”, but in the end, I’m too much and I’m eventually left alone.

My chest hurts, because a part of me is sad they left, but another is happy that I can’t ruin their lives anymore."
DAE: Find themselves daydreaming about something embarrassing they’ve done and then have to say something or make a noise to snap out it.,371,ipuf76,68,"This is hard to explain so bare with me.
I sometimes find myself daydreaming about embarrassing or awkward situations I’ve been in, and then before I realize it out loud I am saying something like “OKAY” or “OH FUCK” or make a crazy noise without realizing it to snap myself out of it. Everyone around me is always like “are you okay” and I have to make something up, it’s ..exhausting."
Small ways to start feeling again,380,iczo7j,40,"1. Drive. To work, to Starbucks, anywhere. Roll down the windows, blast any song you know the words to. I recommend Electric Love or The Story of Us, but it doesn't matter. As long as you know it by heart. Scream the lyrics. And I mean SCREAM them. The music should be loud enough that you can't hear yourself over it.
2. Find your favorite person (or just someone you like). Ask them their favorite meal from when they were a kid. Learn how to make it. Surprise them with it.
3. Take out the first book or movie that made you cry. Read or watch it all over again. Don't judge yourself if you don't cry this time. It doesn't matter.
4. Sit in the sun with nothing to do. Walk around the grass barefoot. Watch the squirrels chase each other, maybe see if you can follow the same one for more than a minute or so. Go through a park, find some flowers, and don't go back until you've found at least 5 bees. I can send you  a scavenger hunt list if you want, or you can make your own.
5. Take photos of things that make you happy. It doesn't matter if you've got a 2011 flip phone camera or a state of the art photography one. In a few weeks, months, years, look back at your album. Slowly but surely and steadily, you'll see how each day has just a few more photos.
6. Copy down the lyrics to a song, or write down a poem you like. Write out paragraphs of a book on your shelf until your hand gets sore. Don't stop before then.
7. Go to your local gym. Punch a punching bag. Do it on the Wii if you don't feel like leaving the house. Let out all the tension. This isn't about burning calories, it's about releasing emotion and anger.
8. Walk laps in your local pool and consciously say in your head everything you notice. ""That person is wearing a red swim suit. I am cold. My left leg is sore. The sun is hot. This pool has a blue bottom.""
9. Lay on your back, cross your arms across your chest, bring your knees to your arms. Have someone you trust push down on your knees as you force out a fake laugh for a few seconds until you belly laugh. There's probably some scientific explanation of why this works. I don't know it. If you think it isn't working, fake laugh harder, and push harder.
10. MOST IMPORTANTLY. Keep going through the motions. They *will* have meaning again. I promise."
I’m so SICK of mindlessly cycling through social media every waking second of my life,372,exw83m,89,My life feels so EMPTY like how do people occupy their time when they aren’t working or at school?? Like what do you DO when you’re alone? People always say “find a hobby” but like okay you can paint a picture for an hour or so but then what? Like this shit is so lonely and pointless. Every day feels like a fucking drag.
When he compliments you,372,djmd6h,61,"When they say ""I've never felt like this with anyone else, you're so perfect for me""
""I love your personality""

"DAE act out imaginary scenarios with people you’ve interacted with in the past, literally having a conversation with yourself out loud?",373,bypccp,57,"What I mean by this is like suppose you had a conversation with a girl you like earlier in the day... when you get home, or even a few days later, you’ll pretend you’re having that same conversation over again but you change the way it went in a better way, acting as if it’s actually real."
Quiet BPD Impulsivity,376,b96wuh,55,"Honestly, being someone with a more moderated expression of Borderline Personality Disorder, I'm somewhat angered when I see so many explanations of BPD and they're catered towards the loud, dramatic, hyper-impulsive type. And all of the quiet representations are of introverted, masochistic individuals and there's never a middle ground. I get how we all see in black and white but none of us are completely on either side of the spectrum.

&#x200B;

Let me explain, I am impulsive in many areas in life other than spending, drugs, sex, and other things. I overshare without thinking, buy loads of plants even though I don't have the space (but I take good care of my babies i love them so much), I always try to feed and nurture every stray or wild animal I see. ( i.e., sneaking stray kittens in my backyard, and making friends with 2 geese that fly by my house), I masturbate until my hears pop, I jump to conclusions like nobodies business, I shoplift random things like pencils and pens and playing cards and miniature figurines and just other useless things for fun. No one knows when I'm doing impulsive things; I only recognize it when it's things I know I shouldn't do, or when things are in excess.

Also, my fear of abandonment is quiet. No one knows when I feel rejected or hurt or abandoned unless my immediate family because I'm more expressive when I'm with them. I dissociate nearly everyday and no one knows. It's more of a constant in-and-out type of thing and most times it wavers and I only mildly dissociate. I can still grasp reality, but sometimes things just feel fake and I question existence and whether I'm real or not. My emotions are extreme but rarely do I project them onto other people. I've learned to hold everything in and suppress how I feel. It never ends in some big explosion and break down though. I'm consistent there, haha. My relationships go through times of idealizing and devaluing but I keep it all inside. I've been doing this my whole life and I don't let others know how I feel or how they hurt me because I've learned that no one else knows how I feel so why even allow them the privilege of knowing?"
DAE hate the follow-up question after you get asked if you wanna kill yourself: “Do you have a suicide plan?”,378,g0dlld,81,"“Do you have the means?” “Do you have a time and place?” etc.

i mean i get that it’s counseling protocol and they have to ask but fuck it doesn’t help at all

no I’m winging it baby lmao I’m dumb and impulsive enough to snap and jump off a bridge or buy rope from home depot after one particularly bad day just because everything hurts and I can’t deal anymore

who knows

that’s the problem

I feel like everything in my life is building up to this moment—like I’m an explosive mine and i don’t know what’s gonna set me off and it terrifies me"
Just saved my friendship by simply waiting,371,f80c7w,18,"When I didn’t receive a message from her all day, I almost had a meltdown. 

I started to assume the worst and began to type up a message along the lines of “I understand if you hate me now” but then I remembered that this was her first day back to work. She lives in another country in a timezone six hours ahead of me and I remembered that it was most likely a long day for her. I didn’t send her any messages and decided to wait instead even though it was difficult for me to do that with my brain trying to convince me that she hates me.

I’m glad that I didn’t send her any messages that could have probably stressed her out because it turns out I was right. She was just tired and she has a whole life outside of me. I know this is a small victory to celebrate but I’m just really happy that I didn’t give in to the voice inside my head and instead, I gave her the time she needed to respond"
DAE 'forget' about depression?,369,etaf16,36,"Like you'll wake up at 12pm and realise you haven't showered in days and haven't changed your clothes? Or you'll realise you haven't left the house in weeks? Or you sit down to play your favourite video game and feel no enjoyment? 

Then it hits you that it's so normalised that you hadn't even noticed. 

It hits you that you can't remember what you've been doing for the last couple of weeks, what did you eat? What did you say? Who did you talk to?

It's just a blank expanse stretching behind and in front of you, and you forgot that it isn't normal."
Managed to make it to an 8am class even though I had a panic attack this morning.,371,apt6ig,41,
Anyone else feel like their paranoia makes them think their coworkers are constantly judging them?,377,k6k6sl,54,"For example, when I came in to work earlier I went into the bathroom to take off leggings I’d worn in. 20 minutes later, I had to go back in to blow my nose. Both are legit reasons to go into the bathroom, and I know that, but I can’t help but feel like they’re thinking about “why did he just go back in there when he was already in there 20 minutes ago” and “this fucking guy doesn’t get any work done”. I feel like they think similar thoughts when I leave the room to get water or something. Plus, sometimes one of them will walk up to the other (I work in a small engineering room that’s very quiet, and only has four other employees in here, two of whom are the bosses) and whisper to each other, then they both start laughing. They’ve known each other over 20 years, so I know they have some sort of relationship where they can joke around and shit, but it drives me nuts not knowing what they’re joking about. Like, why do you have to whisper? Neither one of them are the type who’d make NSFW comments or find them funny, so then what do you need to whisper for? THEY'RE OVER THERE WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER RIGHT NOW AS I POST THIS!!

I’ve talked to my therapist about this, and we both agree that these are irrational thoughts. I know this. Even as I’m imagining what they’re thinking, I’m also actively recognizing that this shit is more than likely not true, and that they think nothing of it.

So yeah, is this just me, or what?"
why do i have to be borderline.,375,iewlb7,47,i hate it so much. i hate hurting and feeling empty all the time and i hate hurting others. i hate having narcissistic tendencies. i hate being toxic for those around me. i hate using people. but the thing i hate most is that i don’t mean to. i don’t realize i’m a terrible person until i ruin someone or its late at night and i’m stuck with my thoughts. i wish people knew i don’t mean to do it on purpose. i have no help. i don’t feel real. my life is just a big lie i made up in my head to make myself feel better about myself. i just don’t want to be me anymore.
"One day you feel ""on top of the world,"" next day suicidal!",373,grgn8h,29,"There's weeks when I feel normal, then there's days of feeling happiness/euphoria, but there are days, usually one or two days where I feel extremely low, on these days it's so bad that sometimes I'm not even able to work, and so I get smashed drunk with friends. 

Today is one of those days, but I'm not drinking. I just feel horrible, and I would rather die."

I know there are plenty of guys like me with BPD, idk, I can’t help how my brain works and that doesn’t make me any less of a man, and it’s derogatory to girls too, as if it makes it any less serious because more girls are diagnosed with it than men, I hate the stigma.

DAE have a total mental breakdown and then feel completely normal the day after?,377,do02r5,65,"(TW: suicidal thoughts) 

I’ll have days where I just cry and my anxiety is over the roof. I’ll think that my whole world is in shambles and that there’s nothing I can do to fix it. I’ll convince myself that my friends don’t want me around and that no one will ever want me and I’ll just cry alone for hours. My future seems bleak and ending it seems like a good way to prevent myself from feeling the pain of failing in life. Then the next day, I’ll feel some clarity and realise that the world isn’t ending and things aren’t as bad as they seemed in that moment."

DAE seclude themselves from ppl for long periods of time?,369,koq0qo,44,"Pushing people away because you're afraid of abandonment is one thing, but what about isolating yourself by staying home for most of the day, not texting people as much as you used to, and other behaviors that people would look at and call you antisocial for?

It's a mix of feeling mentally exhausted all the time and not wanting to deal with people more than you have to because you just don't have the energy or willingness to put in more effort or time than is necessary to get through any interaction.

I'm curious if I'm the only one. I've heard about people on here isolating themselves because they fear the people they could grow to care about might leave and I completely understand where they're coming from but I just wondering if anyone else has or has been isolating themselves for the reasons Iv mentioned. Hope at least some of you can possibly relate"
Anyone else with BPD oddly relate to DiD (Dissociative Identity Disorder)?,370,kns9xb,79,"I feel like sometimes, instead of dissociating into a different personality, I dissociate into a version of myself that can emotionally handle a situation.

Not like an entirely different person with their own life and memories or anything extreme like that- I don't think it's related to DiD, I just relate to the idea of having a different version of myself that helps me deal with certain situations.

Just me? 😅"
DAE feel like we are strong AF for being able to live with BPD?,373,jsqkco,47,"I genuinely don’t think that the average everyday person could deal with what we deal with everyday. 

I think we are all strong as FUCK for being able to get through the day with hmm, let’s see...

- Extreme mood swings that can change within minutes or even seconds 

- Going from wanting to die to feeling like a bad bitch in 2 seconds 

- SELF HATRED, feelings of worthlessness 

- Splitting 

- Dissociation 

- Having to act calm normal in public when you’re literally holding it together at the seams trying not to scream, or break down and cry.

Most everyday people who don’t have BPD are barely functional as is, can you imagine if they DID have bpd? 

Girl they could not handle what we have to 😭

We are strong, and resilient. This disorder is hella annoying but we are stronger because of it. We will get through this, each and every one of us. 

I love you all 💓"
Marijuana use and bpd,374,kchf77,202,"So I’ve been smoking daily for almost 3 years. I’ve noticed that when I’m sober, my symptoms are much, much worse. I have a lot more outbursts and I’m just in general usually not in the mood to talk to anyone because I fear whatever I say will turn into an outburst. After I’ve smoked tho I’m okay. I can talk and laugh with people without blowing up, I can act like a normal, functional human being. Now in the past 3 years I’ve only ever had to quit once, I went cold turkey for a month and it was terrible. That’s when I realized I was dependent on weed. I worked drive thru in a fast food restaurant and would have an episode almost daily. I pushed almost everyone I cared about away. Like I said I’m very aware that I’m dependent on marijuana, but I don’t see why that has to be a bad thing. It’s no different from someone with a physical sickness taking their meds everyday. Like if someone with ADHD skipped their meds one day and was acting extra hyper, and someone close to them noticed they would just say “oh, he just needs to take his meds he’ll b okay” but yet if I blow up because I didn’t smoke that day, I’m a monster and I need to control myself and get my dependency in check. Anyone else feel this way? (Not looking for someone to come in and tell me that what I’m doing is wrong, just needed to vent and maybe see if anyone else can relate)"
"It has officially been 8 months since I last selfharmed, which is easily the longest I've ever made it",370,jcmfkp,30,It has been 8 months to the day so it's officially been 2/3 of a year. I feel like I should feel more proud of that fact. I'm going to get a tattoo over scars to celebrate 1 year when I get there. This is definitely the longest I've ever made it although I can't say I remember what the most was in the past. Half a year tops but probably more like a few months. I can't say I ever would have expected what happened February 16th to be the last time but I sincerely hope that it was the last time ever. It would kill me to ever restart the clock after coming this far.
I hate how all emotional abuse books paint people w/BPD as the only ones who can be toxic,374,idegg0,65,"Tldr: venting about current relationship, emotional abuse, and people constantly shitting on BPD. 

I’ve been doing some looking on Amazon on books to heal from codependency and other unhealthy relationship/emotional abuse topics. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, although I do think that we are at the end of our rope. Or at least that we probably should be. I know that he is manipulative and emotionally abusive to me, but I just can’t bring myself to pull the plug yet, because of my codependency. 

Over the past two years of our relationship, we both haven’t been 100% healthy towards each other, and there are still some things I do that aren’t healthy (eg. Yelling during fights, using the word “always” to describe some of his negative behaviors, and being codependent). We’ve had amazing times too, but there’s always been something unhealthy floating around in the background, if that makes sense. 

He has gaslit me many times, been dismissive, made threats, etc. He still currently does those things and that has been steady throughout the majority of our two years together along with many other things that I didn’t realize were emotional abuse until recently. 

I was in therapy for almost a year, so I worked on a lot of my toxic issues. I surprisingly never talked much about my current relationship, because idk I always thought I was the only problem. And that fixing my BPD related issues would make our relationship good and healthy. 

I worked really, really hard in therapy and still work hard to keep up on myself (ex. Reading dbt books, journaling, etc.) I’ve come a long way, and I’m not trying to kiss my own ass, but I genuinely don’t think that I’m super toxic anymore. 

At least I think I believe that most of the time. I don’t trust myself at really anything. Which I think people w/BPD suffer from. We tend to not know/trust what the difference is between a normal reaction and our emotions being out of whack. And even now as I type this, I wonder: am I actually the toxic one? Like he says I am? Are these things and rifts in our relationship my fault? Is it gaslighting or me? I go back and forth all the time. Anyhoo. 

I just hate that while scrolling and looking for all of these books that I’ve come across many that in the description make it clear that people w/BPD are always the problem. I don’t even consider giving those books a try, because it just infuriates me that we’re often written off as a group of people that can only ever be the problem and not have anyone be problematic towards us. 

I can admit that sometimes I have been the cause of turmoil and hard times in my relationships, but at times I’ve been the one put down, abused, etc. and I don’t think it’s fair that few people focus on that narrative. I at least wish that these emotional abuse books would leave BPD out of it. Why can’t they make a general book on recovering from emotional abuse and having healthy relationships without bashing other mental illnesses? 

So, yea, that’s my vent. If anyone has any book recommendations that don’t think people w/ BPD are the worst people you could ever encounter, please throw them at me. 

And if anyone has ever found themselves in an unhealthy relationship but feel scared to leave, please also tell me what you did to cope with that or what your experiences with emotional abuse have been."

"I hate when people try to comfort me by saying, ""Everyone feels that way sometimes.""",370,dl0wz5,71,"Why do people think it's comforting to tell someone who is struggling that everyone feels like they do sometimes. Way to minimize my feelings and confirm that I don't deserve comfort or anything; that I'm an utter piece of shit that everyone deserves never having ever known.

&#x200B;

Edit: so I get that the pieces of this means of comfort are saying: ""you aren't alone"", and ""it will pass."" But I don't think those are necessarily helpful. Because I FEEL things by myself; I am alone in my suffering. None of my friends or relatives or loved ones are like this, just me, and I suffer it alone. I KNOW other people experience the shittiness of what I'm going through, but I, for the life of me, can't figure out why knowing that will help me and what I'm feeling.  
And the it will pass thing: rationally I know that. But I think it invalidates the complexities of what our emotions cause us to feel when we pass over the moment by saying, it will get better. I get why aspects of this are important: we shouldn't focus on the shittiness if there is greatness to come. But for someone with BPD, the greatness will also fucking pass and everything will be shitty again. We need help in dealing with the shittiness in the moment. And this looks different for everyone.

So I hate this means of comfort. And maybe that's on me and my flawed way of thinking. But it comes off as though the person saying it is simply saying, ""get over it so I don't have to deal with you anymore."""
Is dating anyone else's biggest trigger?,367,deqat2,75,"Nothing causes me to split or dissociate more than dating. Especially in today's toxic dating culture. I want to find a partner and emotional intimacy so badly, but then when people ghost or are disrespectful  or inappropriate it just makes me die a little inside each time.

Does anyone else gets extremely aggressive and evil when pissed?,374,aycau9,82,"So the thing is, when someone hurts me, its makes them turn into my enemy in my head. And all the love, mercy, friendship i felt towards them turns into revenge and menace and pure hatred. Like i wish the person died. Like i just want to claw their face off and let them live on with an unrecognizable face. Thats how evil amd revengeful i am. 

Right now there is an asshole colleague who ruined my work schedule because every month she takes 12 days off for any and every flu. And she is a toxic bitch. And i never talked to her because i know what would happen when i get angry and also bc she is very selfish and toxic. But she ruined my schedule and i let the other shit slide until now. But now ill take revenge for EVERYRHING she has done to me. And shes done a lot, believe me. I just stayed away to make it a teamwork but she is impossible to bear and handle.

Not really BPD specific but watching someone slowly lose interest in you is the worst feeling ever,369,ds3et2,41,My heart physically aches. I feel like I can’t breathe. It’s all I can think about. I want to beg for him to stay as if that would do anything. The fact that there’s absolutely nothing you can do is the worst feeling ever. I feel so helpless.
"So, he blocked me everywhere. What now?",368,b3rx42,40,"My ex blocked me everywhere, right before my birthday. 

The past few days, I have been inconsolable. I’ve spent my spring break vacation mostly blowing money on beauty products and locking myself in my bedroom at my childhood home. 

I have checked my emails and my texts almost constantly, praying that he has a change of heart and contacts me in some way.

That hasn’t happened. It’s not going to happen. He’s done with me. He’s established his boundaries. 

It is not my job to test them. He does not want to talk to me. He does not want to see me. He does not want to be near me.

**So, what do I do now?**

The answer is NOTHING.

This is life. 

This is something that everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, deals with at some point in time. It is heartbreak. 

It fucking sucks, and it hurts worse for people like us. I know this. I know it is a physical pain that makes you feel like you’re going to die. I  know that you just want to kill yourself so you can stop the pain before it consumes you completely. 

But you have to accept it. 

***I*** have to accept it. 

I went to physical therapy a few weeks ago so that I can address some unrelated chronic pain issues. You know what my physical therapist said?

“It’s going to hurt, and you’re going to have to accept that. Pain isn’t normal, but you have to feel it in order to get better.”

That’s what is happening here. 

I can continue wrecking my life over a man who doesn’t want to talk to me, or I can get up and accept that people get their hearts broken every day and that it doesn’t mean there is something fundamentally wrong with me. It doesn’t mean I'm not good enough. 

I can learn from my mistakes. I can learn to love myself. I can accept that I was not the only one who made mistakes in that relationship (and oh boy, I was NOT), and no one has to be the bad guy. 

I forgive him for what he did to me. I am not sure if he will forgive me for what I did to him. 

And that doesn’t matter. That is his personal decision. If he chooses not to forgive me, that doesn't mean I don't deserve happiness. That doesn’t mean I can’t be a good person.

I feel so much shame right now, but it’s GUILT. I made mistakes, and I feel bad about them. I now have to change my behavior. My brain is telling me that something is wrong with how I acted at the end of our relationship because THERE WAS. 

So, I’m going to get up right now. I am going to stop wallowing in self-pity, blasting “You Stupid Bitch” from *Crazy Ex-Girlfriend*, and I am going to have a fun day by myself. And tonight, I am going to celebrate my birthday a week early with my family. I will go out with my old friends here afterwards.

And in a week, when I am back in the same city as him, nothing will have changed. I will likely spend my birthday alone. And that is okay. 

I will be okay."

"I'm calling my automatic thoughts & heightened emotions ""fan fiction"" and I'm calling my *actual behavior* ""canon"" & it's extremely helpful",370,dyxfo1,53,"I've decided there's nothing wrong with my feelings. It's my behavior that matters


So I'm calling my automatic thoughts & heightened emotions ""fan fiction"" and I'm calling my *actual behavior* ""canon"". Someone recently ranted to me, about Kanye West, ""It's ok that you're crazy, but be crazy at home. We don't all need to know. And we wouldn't know if you didn't say all the crazy stuff you say out loud.""  Not only was it endearing & hilarious, but it really resonated with me.


A real & constant struggle for me has been to validate my feelings without acting on them. The Kanye rant made something ""click"" for me. My feelings are valid. It's ok to love intensely. It's ok to feel anger. But when you feel like doing ineffective behaviors, it's not ok to follow through. 


For me in my head it looks like this-

Being in love-
Fan fiction= use sex to get attention & affection 
Canon= don't act on those urges, but rather learn & practice the skills it takes to sustain meaningful relationships 


Being angry-
Fan fiction= pepper spray a stranger for cutting me off in traffic 
Canon= Pause. Process the thoughts & emotions. Do nothing. Drive away. 


The fan fiction is valid. It can even feel good to fantasize about doing something I have the urge to do (having spontaneous sex /hurting someone). But they are not to manifest beyond the confines of my own mind. The fan fiction is for me & me alone. I may share with therapist; or loved ones for amusement. But I am never to act on them. They are not canon. 


Fan fiction can be delightful. It is valid in its own world. It can be enjoyed & appreciated. But it is not canon. 


Looking at it this way is helping improve my behavior & manage my ""fan fiction"" without hurting anyone or myself. 


My feelings are valid. But they no longer dictate my behavior. At least, it's what I'm going for"
I reached out to my former employer after having a full blown mental breakdown a few months ago that resulted in my firing.,371,df9kd2,13,"I didnt reach out to ask for my job back, or anything like that- just getting that out first. I reached out to apologize for my behavior and the abysmal way I represented myself and my character for the window of time that they knew/employed me. I was in the most traumatic situation I've ever been in, and my bpd was compounding everything and making it that much more intense. I was completely unable to function as a person much less as an employee. 

So. A few nights ago (about two or so months after the fact) I reached out and apologized for everything and gave a light explanation and owned it, then gave an update that I'm doing better. Two days later I got a reply and they were so receptive and told me that the character I displayed in sending the message is how I will be remembered. 

I've been crying on and off all day over this. I'm just so glad to have been able to repair their perception of me and I'm still so sad that everything went down the way it did. But I feel better. I feel some closure which is so, so nice.

This belief has been brewing in my head since way before my diagnosis. My 25th birthday was nothing but a shock. Now I literally can’t see myself living beyond about 26 or 27. I just think my life will end before then, one way or another. I don’t completely know where the thought/belief comes from or why. Does anyone else feel that way? If so, why?

Today I kept thinking about it, but I didn't self harm. I'm really proud of myself, although at the same time I believe that I'll never do it again even if I really feel the need to.

This can only get better. You've started the year off with a low, with self hatred, with anger. But it will get better. It will absolutely get better. You are going to do incredible things this year, you are going to keep surviving, keep making the best out of a bad situation. Forget NY resolutions. Fuck em. They'll just make you feel inadequate if you don't meet them. Make goals and make them realistic. Set realistic goals, small but manageable goals. Like go to this restaurant you've always wanted to go to, go on more drives for the hell of it to listen to tunes or an audio book, go to more therapy sessions. You're never going to completely change your life in one year. But you will do a heap of little things that will make your life better. 

This is just the beginning. It's not the end. Please don't make 2021 the end because life has got so much left for you. Even if they're little things.

"""Be careful of connections that feel like home, if home was never a safe place for you""",364,fj2jou,13,"I'm learning the older I (28f) get, that I'm at my most functional when I'm in a relationship with narcissistic  individuals that allow no room for my emotional wellbeing. I get addicted to that rollercoaster of them making you feel like shit and then dishing out crumbs of affection. I, without the conscious decision to, revolve my whole life around them and keeping them happy and stable. My symptoms are lessened. My emotions, for them, controlled. 

Obviously this is toxic. The logical solution to this should be to just not have these kind of relationships or just veto romantic relations all together. The issue for me here is without these people in my life. Life is just empty. The depression is heavy and I'm at my most dysfunctional. I once didn't leave the house for 12 months. Saw no sunlight. Had no human conversations. After a sustained period of this, those crumbs start to look appealing. The abuse starts to seem like an acceptable compromise. 

I've been blessed to meet some beautiful, empathetic humans who, unlike these narcissistic types, care about my feelings too. I just can't maintain my interest. Without the abuse-reward system, my symptoms show. I split on them and eventually, I usher them gently out of my life through fear of effecting them negatively. I do not want to be a bad person.

This feeling isn’t as common but definitely still applies when dating someone that I don’t live with. I’ve also experienced it with friends. 

I almost feel like it’s a micro expression of fear of abandonment."
I did so good today,364,m7jw6d,25,"I was upset at what my grandma was doing so I politely told her to stop instead of snapping at her. 

When she didn't stop even though she knew her behavior was effecting me. I again told her calmly to stop and refused to let her divert the blame onto me by shifting the subject and strongly held to my boundaries that I would be upset with her if she refused to stop her harmful behavior and then ended the conversation.

When she continued this behavior and I felt an episode coming on so I removed myself from the situation.

And after all this was over I wasn't mad at myself for voicing my boundaries because I reminded myself that her reaction isn't something I can control and has no reflection on me. 

Normally this would have ended in a screaming match and me hating myself afterwards but I stood up for myself healthily today and I'm proud of myself for it."
Mourn the loss of loved ones/pets who haven’t died yet?,364,hu3jz6,35,My dog is 13 and I know she probably only has a few more years left and the older she gets the more frequently I find myself having crying fits over the idea of eventually having to lose her. Is this normal?
WE ARE OKAY,366,g40uid,61,"It’s fucking okay to have BPD. My ex messaged me and said that “real men don’t deal with people that have emotional problems”. And I’m here to fucking say that BOYS don’t deal with people with emotional problems. Don’t settle with this shit. It’s OKAY. We are okay and it’s fine that we are accepting what’s going on with us. I love you all &amp; we are in this together. If they don’t accept that, just move on from them. Because bitches ain’t shit but hoes and tricks."
DAE always overshare then only afterwards feel bad because they weren’t sure if they were attention seeking or not?,363,e5rgnt,50,I overshare all the time and I always wonder if I did it for attention and I’m never quite sure. It really gets to me
Does anyone else feel like they’re always “clearing things”/“starting over”?,359,dn9an5,55,"After I come down from a really bad depressive episode I usually starting literally & figuratively clearing things. For example I delete photos from my phone (I keep the important ones that I think are important at the time), I clean my room until it’s literally spotless. And this can happen day to day or after a week, it’s just really random when it happens. And I feel like starting over, I go to the gym, go outside, socialise like it never happened and pretending I’m a new man? 

Anyone else have this type of thing?
Thanks x"
Anyone else feel like disappearing so others wonder where you went?,365,byhwwt,54,"Whenever I don't get any messages / responses or when I realise again that the only time people message me is if I message them first, I feel like completely disappearing for a long time so that people start to think about me, wonder what happened to me, and actually message me.

Usually I can't stop myself from messaging people for more than a day, but when I uninstalled Facebook once and came back after 2 weeks of not sending a single message, nobody messaged me anyway, although I still have the urge to do it nowadays.

Anyone else?"
Y’all I didn’t obsess!,361,b4v1pm,47,"So, I broke up with my ex a few months ago and recently we’d been talking casually. I made it clear to him that I need time to work on my life and myself first and he said he understood. 

This morning, I woke up to find that he’d blocked me on EVERYTHING. Me from last year would’ve exploded and started calling him over and over, crying, leaving voicemails, but when I saw it today I just laughed and carried on with my day. Of course it hurts, but I’ve realised that I can’t control how he feels and if he needs time then so be it. I’m just surprised that I didn’t obsess like wtf!! :O"
Just a reminder to stop romanticising fucking everything,364,a18v8d,26,"The blood, the drugs, the guys who treat you like shit. None of this is romantic. It’s dysfunctional and disgusting and you deserve better. "
"I dream of the day I can browse reddit without people diagnosing every horrible woman with ""BPD""",360,9msv8b,71,"It would make my day 13% better. 



Today I was reading a post about a man who was cheated on by his wife. in the comments some users were saying ""WOW she def has BPD, u dodged a bullet""



Anytime a woman does something horrible, comments say BPD! BPD! but if it was a man comments would be ""Sorry this happened, HE is a bad man."" 
 blah blah and something like ""not all men are like this""

"I now consider myself ""cured"" from borderline personality disorder. Here to share some positive vibes. Feel free to ask me anything.",366,kiduxi,116,"Hello, I used to be a somehow active member of this sub. My last post was about me entering a treatment center. [Here the post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/b3u7bn/monday_im_going_to_a_bpd_rehab_center_wish_me_luck/) I've stayed there for 14 months.  I now consider myself 99% rehabilitated. I thought my experience would be useful.

Long story short. I suffer from mental issues for my whole life. I am 29 and starting to have problems at 12. At 27 I attempted suicide. The list of the disorder I suffer from were. Severe anxiety, social phobia, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder. After my suicide attempt at 27 I was officially diagnoses (through SCID 5 test, based on DSM) for Borderline Personality disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, Depressive Disorder, and Passive-Aggressive Disorder. I also had a history of abusing Xanax and stuff.

So my year in a treatment center had transformed my life, I have remission of most symptoms, I no longer feel that sense of emptiness that I used to. I no longer have depression.  I used to have all the common symptoms of BPD (i thought probably I used to be a quiet borderline  To put it simply. I still got angry a lot, and violently but I suppressed most of it. Instead of driving my rage outside, I drove it inward.)

Still, life isn't perfect. But the difference between the person I was before and the persona I am now is like night and day, I can't even tell how I changed.

I now feel like my life is fair. I always feel like I was giving too much to bear. Living with borderline, and other mental illness is a nightmare. Right now is like I'm finally awake and I'm kinda happy. I feel like I have control and power over my life. The suicide thinking pattern was a big one for me. I no longer have it. like never.

I still doing individual therapy. I went from 10-15 (antidepressant, anxiolytics, lithium, mood stabilizer, etc) meds at the day to just one that I intended to stop taking soon.

The thing that helps me the most were CBT therapy and uncovering my dysfunctional thinking pattern, and slowly modify them. Also, I followed a program called STEPPS that is made for BDP disorder that is really good to learn to cope with intense emotion and extreme behavior.

It would take a book to tell all the ah-ah moment and the step by step process I went through, that led to my rehabilitation but I Just wanna say It's definitely possible to live a good and satisfying life.

I wish you all the best.

&#x200B;

P.S. I'm from Italy.

PPS. I put the word ""cured"" with quotation marks. You can change the word with ""rehabilitated"" or

""I Learned to managed my symptoms, my thoughts, and actions to an extent that the condition of having Borderline Personality Disorder has no longer a negative impact on my life."" "
"Life was not made for me, nor was I made for it",360,i7ygfj,54,"I have thought that ""normal"" people (the standard of society), who live a normal life and don’t think beyond it and simply accept everything, can really be happy.  But then there are the people who think absolutely everything and look beyond and realize the cruelty of life, the cruelty of the human being and it just feels horrible.  Like you don't fit in and you know you never will.

Sometimes I feel that I was not born for this world, or for life, I feel empty with all this, and I am probably not the only one, probably someone else understands my words. I hope so.

I look at people, situations, things around me and it just feels so alien.  I feel that being born was a waste, I cannot offer much to life, just thinking (and it is not much use when thought dominates you), I feel that life trapped me in its ""we are born to die"" and I will not be able to do anything against it because  that's how it is.

"When someone doesn't reply to me, it puts me in a really dark place. How do you guys cope when someone you are close to doesn't reply/ ghosts you?",359,i2du7c,3,"I don't know if this is the same for everyone, but if someone stops replying to me for hours and I'm close to that person, it makes me feel like I'm going to puke. The anxiety is constant and it feels unbearable. It can even go as far as to make me very suicidal. The idea that that person could never reply makes me so scared. This typically ends up making me clingy and I send the person lots of texts until they reply because I start freaking out.

What would be a good way to cope?"
DAE feel like their brain is almost like another person separate from yourself,358,gqzai0,59,"Sometimes I just can’t shut it off and my own thoughts give me a headache and stress me the fuck out and make me super anxious. It literally exhausts me. Its almost always negative thoughts too and its happening right now, it feels like there is some person just non stop talking in my head but its actually like a million thoughts all at once over and over again and it feels overwhelming. I have a headache and I’m exhausted."
Having BPD is like playing life on hard mode,359,dwdoh5,46,"A good friend shared this analogy with me today, and it really resonated. 

Life and relationships are hard enough to navigate without BPD. Having BPD makes it all the more difficult. 

I hope this helps someone else have some self compassion today. We didn't choose to have this condition. It sucks sometimes, but it's part of the beauty and complexity of life. I won't say I'm grateful for having BPD, but I am grateful that I can see the beautiful nuances in life that most people ignore. Do your best today, that's all you can do."
Bpd is fucking exhausting.,357,bndxag,45,"Does anyone else feel so fucking exhausted just from being who they are?  It's so fucking exhausting to continuously go from 0-100 94637x a day. Holy fuck.

And friends/family get exhausted, too. And I'm trying to manage and cope and be skillful. BUT HOLY FUCK.

Thank you. That is all."
The feels when your partners tone of voice is slightly different and you're convinced he's planning to leave you.,362,9l1rrk,35,I've been apologising all day even though I don't know why. 
A list of (rather... harsh?) things I wish I realized before I lost my SO. TW just in case.,362,96jbkj,59,"I’m honestly too scared to post this on my main account, but recently, my SO finally ended our relationship. Ever since, I’ve been reflecting on my situation, and I have been realizing how toxic I was to him. Here’s a list of some of the things I realized in no particular order. They may be rather... harsh? It’s mostly for myself, and this is strictly from personal experience, but maybe someone will get something out of it, and save their relationship. 

**Compassion fatigue is a very real thing.** My SO used to be caring, reassuring, and compassionate. By the end of our relationship, he was distant, defensive, and rather cold. I was absolutely confused and freaked out by this change: Is he abusive now!? Does he not care anymore!? No. He was drained. Can you imagine how much shit you have to put someone through for them to change like that? Yet, there I was, *still* driving him insane instead of trying to get better, which resulted in pushing him further away.

**Having BPD/trauma does not excuse or justify any toxic behavior, period.** I thought I understood this. I really, really did. But whenever I would hurt my SO, I would often tell him how I have BPD and he can’t expect me to get better that fast. Or I’d sit there wondering how I could get him to understand my mental illness. Or how HE can change. But the reality is, I'm responsible for my own emotions and actions, no matter who/what triggers them.

**I have to get better for myself.** I picked up DBT solely to be with my SO. Bad idea. Someone can be a motivator, but making them the prime reason to seek help caused idealization(?). Whenever we’d argue, I’d easily ditch all of the skills I learned, because I felt unappreciated by the person who I was improving myself for. Also, I would also get angry when my SO didn’t see progress, even though I knew it was there, so I’d give up. This all made learning DBT skills kind of pointless. 

**Not everyone goes through behavioral therapy.** One thing I noticed when I picked up DBT was that my SO’s “bad” coping and communication habits felt magnified in my eyes, and I would feel bothered/disrespected by them, even though they never bothered me before. It made me angry he wasn’t “matching my effort.” In reality, *most people aren’t handed a literal textbook with instructions on how to cope, think, and communicate.* Instead, they’ve learned these things from their own experience. People are generally trying their best. Their “best” might look different from mine, and that’s okay. 

**Anyone that tells me “I wont leave you” still has the right to leave me.** They probably meant it when they said it, but wasn’t aware of what a battle it is to be with someone who has BPD (and PTSD in my case). No one is obligated to be with me, no matter how much it hurts to see them leave. This person has rights, boundaries, and needs in the relationship too. If I’m not giving them back the love and support they were pouring into me, the person has the right to walk away.

**Being defensive can make you hyper sensitive to potential threats and blind to your own faults. This applies to BOTH parties.** About 90% of arguments with my SO stemmed from me overreacting. I would (unknowingly) shift the blame/bug him like crazy, trying to get him to recognize what he did “wrong”. He had to protect himself from me because I did this so often. Eventually he became defensive towards me himself. So, whenever the 10% would happen, where he was actually being inconsiderate or hurtful, he would assume I was just being sensitive/blame shifting again.

**Others online can’t always determine if your SO/FP is toxic or not from just a few posts.** This is because 1) There’s always going to be a degree of bias from both the poster and commenter, and 2) there’s usually information and events leading up to the incident missing from these posts.

Say someone posts “My BF got drunk again. He saw me break down, lashed out, then stonewalled me.” Sounds kind of alarming, doesn’t it? But until we see the bigger picture, it is hard to say. For example:

- SCENARIO 1: The SO is an alcoholic with anger issues. He very frequently lashes out at his partner over small things. This time was no different. He yelled at his girlfriend who was crying and begging him for forgiveness, then proceeded to ignore them to regain control.
- SCENARIO 2: The SO is tired of being mistreated by his partner. He feels like he tried everything. He recently started drinking to cope. He comes home to her blowing up about not being there for her. He finally snaps and yells at her, then shuts down, wishing he had more freedom and space.

Both are about someone angry and drunk, but two completely different stories. People may assume different scenarios depending on their own experience. My biggest. Mistake. *EVER.* Was telling my SO he is abusive because someone online told me he is. Third opinions are often necessary, and it is entirely possible a person is abusive, but I think it’s important to keep all of this in mind.

**We have the potential to get better.** We. Can. Do. This! It’s hard to rewire your brain, but it’s not impossible. We just have to believe in ourselves and keep pushing, even when things feel impossible.

I prided in being self aware, but it turns out, I was still toxic. Please be kind to the ones that love you. You have more control over yourself than you’d ever imagine."
I want to abandon/be abandoned by everyone,362,k1y9ac,38,"No matter how much I love my loved ones, I feel better alone every time.

Because with them, there's always expectations, responsibilities, things to live up to. I inevitably disappoint and hurt them, and it makes me want to blow my brains out

It's like I have to live ""multiple lives"", one for myself to survive (video games, music, drugs) , and other ones for my loved ones so they aren't neglected by me

I can't keep up with it and it makes me suicidal"

DAE notice changes in their handwriting if they’re in a depressive vs stable episode?,360,iqqo3h,67,"I’m recovering from a depressive episode (a longish month) and noticed that my handwriting went back to my before the episode handwriting - it’s not conscious, just the way my hands flow. Has anyone else experienced this?"
I'm starting college tomorrow,363,iff6o2,37,"After 2 years of not doing ANYTHING when I graduated high school due to BPD, trying to go to classes for the college admission exam and abandoning them and two failed degrees, last month I decided to apply for college and I passed the exam.

Now, tomorrow I have my first day at school and even though it's gonna be online, I'm really excited for this new part of my life since I thought I'd never accomplish it. Please wish me luck, school is kind of my biggest fear since all of my trauma is thanks to it lol. 

This is the biggest progress I've ever made in my whole life and I'm also getting so much better at DBT and group therapy. I just wanted to share it."
DAE only lash out in their mind?,364,hccf3u,45,"As stated above, do you experience the same thing? Like, I don't show people that I am mad at them because I am afraid to be disliked and abandoned, but in my mind I create scenarios where I lash out to them and say all the things I could've said or wanted to say for a long time. i.e imagining that I am having fight with my parents and calling out their narcissistic behaviours. I don't know if this is healthy or not, but this is the only way I can manage my anger."
DAE have days where they seriously consider cutting off everyone?,361,gx9nzy,38,"Lately I've been struggling a lot with random thoughts of cutting off everyone I love, because I feel so desperate and toxic, and I can't help but think that if I really did love these people, I would do them the favor of removing the negativity from their lives.

Update on my previous post!,357,j4etzt,38,"I GOT THE JOB!!! 

I actually got the job, and was successful. I start next Thursday. My dudes, I’m so bloody happy right now. I’m just gonna repeat myself...

I GOT THE JOB! 

I don’t want it to seem like I’m bragging so I apologise if it’s comes across that way,l. But this is a huge achievement for me. For my anxiety. For my mental health... everything. 

I just wanted to share it because I know sometimes it seems like things don’t work out, and I used to hate the phrase ‘It Gets Better’ but man, with hard work and determination (on the days I actually get to feel it) it really does.

UPDATE: Man, I don’t think I’ve ever received much love from anywhere. Just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to comment, I can not tell you how much you’ve inspired me to just keep going. Also thank you to three people who gave me awards. I feel like I’ve found my tribe with all of you guys. Thank you so effing much. ❤️🖤"
DAE act so nice to the people you just meet to the point of flirting?,358,d9qejc,67,"I don't mean to flirt, I just want them to like me. So I guess I subconsciously use that 'bpd charm' which is basically just being super friendly and open and smiling a lot and showing genuine interest in their life and what they have to say, with some funny-witty remarks and this always works on people but they somehow end up thinking that I'm flirting and I don't actually blame them. 

But it's just that this fear of rejection and not being liked is so bad that after sensing and analyzing them and what they like, I basically turn into this customized perfect person for each different individual so that they would like me.

People think I'm super social and popular but really, it just comes down to this."
Things I wish someone had told me when I was diagnosed,359,mdfz2u,42,"Hey there, I’ve been thinking a lot about how little help there was for me when I was younger, and I’m finally far enough along in my recovery I can make being in groups like this a positive thing, so here goes. 

1. Whatever you do, don’t make borderline your identity. Its so easy to take this label you’ve been given and latch onto it, especially because one of the biggest symptoms is lack of identity. I wish someone had told me how fucking awful of an idea it is. The more obsess about it, “embrace” it, the more you learn and read, the worse you feel. You stop yourself from ever being more than a borderline person. You are so so much more than you diagnosis and the symptoms of it. Don’t sell yourself short. 

2. Your symptoms of borderline are NOT a representation of who you are or your worth as a person. Again, you are so much more than this. Just like you wouldnt tell someone with OCD or depression that their thoughts are a representation of themselves, this applies to you. Your actions are your responsibility, but your urges and thoughts and the feelings this monster forces upon you are not your fault or who you are. 

3. Don’t seek out what other people say about BPD. Please. I did this a lot and it hurt so fucking bad. I’d never even respond or confront, it just grew resentment for the world and self loathing inside my heart. Ignorance is the lack of knowledge. They cannot help what they dont know. Don’t let their ignorance define you. 

4. Find an identity. Art, hobbies, writing, even if its just a podcast you like or playing video games, find something good to identify with. 

5. Find your values, like the ACT value list/test [downloadable for free here](https://www.psychologytools.com/resource/values/).Seriously, realizing there was more to me than my negative behaviors was fucking life changing. 

6. DBT is boring &amp; tedious as shit, but my god its the best thing you can do. The other therapy that really saved me was ACT. DBT taught me how to act &amp; cope, ACT made me okay with who I was, and taught me to love myself. 

7. Its not hopeless. I swear to god its not hopeless. I know it feels like you will never ever get better, and even less likely you will ever feel better, but its possible. You deserve it. It took me like 7 years but I here I am, being okay & content with life. Loving who I am. Stable self image. Its possible. It takes a fuckton of work, but its possible. You are worth recovery and happiness and peace. 

I guess I’ll end this with some quotes and songs which stick out to me & have helped. 

“What happened to you is not your fault, but what you do going forward us your responsibility.” 

“Where there is desire there is going to be a flame, and where there is a flame someone’s bound to get burned, just because it hurts doesn’t mean you’re going to die, you’ve gotta get up and try.” 
Its from a pink song but it makes me tear up even now 

As well as the songs “Shake It Out” by Florence and the machine and “I Wanna Get Better” by Bleachers.

An edit with two more thoughts: 

“This too shall pass. Painfully, like a kidney stone, but it will pass.” This i feel applies to BPD well. With constantly changing emotions, I can always take comfort on even if i feel excruciatingly sad or upset, in a few hours I know I’ll feel differently. Change is the only constant. 

And finally feelings are not facts. When I split on those close to me, or feel intense negativity, that one has always spoken volumes. Just because I feel it doesn’t mean its factual, but just because its not factual doesn’t mean I’m not feeling it."
I'm so fucking done,361,j38zi3,76,"I know this post is going be ignored anyway so I'm just going selfishly rant on here. IM TIRED OF FUCKING BEGGING FOR HELP AND FRIENDS. I'm a simple person that  just wants chill and play video games but  Everytime I try to make friends I keep getting fucking ghosted or ignored.Everytime I ask for help on places it gets ignored. LIKE WHAT ELSE DO I FUCKING HAVE TO DO? THREAD SITES LIKE THIS MAKE YOU FEEL EVEN WORST BECAUSE  YOU POUR YOUR HEART OUT IN A POST AND ITS 100% IGNORED BUT A PERSON WITH THE SAME BASIC SHIT IS SHOWRED WITH AWARDS AND SUPPORT. The feeling of becoming invisible is exactly what drives people to fucking suicide. I'm tired of being this pathetic beggar.

Update edit:
Thank you for all the comments. It think it's funny the one time I flip out during bad episode, I suddenly got all the support,unlike the other calm posts i had in the past. I guess people relate more to the anger?  Anyway, so the people that keep asking me the same questions:

>Yes, I have therapist but I have mixed feelings about her because she gives me basic solutions. I feel like everything she says is just a bandaid. I might just get a new one soon. 

>I have plenty of hobbies such as anime, video games and crafts but does not mean you enjoy doing it when you get into a horrible mood. 

>I dont care about the likes, awards or comments. I was saying that I have had times I really expressed really bad grief and it felt like it got pushed under the rug.

Many people are right when they said I need to focus on myself but, the problem with having BPD is having feeling of constant abandonment and then fear of other people’s intentions. It's an everyday struggle that I work through with my husband and guinea pigs. Thanks again."
Unpopular BPD opinion,363,iik03b,122,I have bpd myself so don’t come for me BUT: sometimes people abandoning you is your fault and your fault only. And you can’t be mad at them for it either. If you switch up on someone who’s not mentally ill theyre not gonna understand and they’ll get tired off it. I know all of us on here a mentally ill but Sometimes a little bit of self awareness helps.

DAE feel weirdly relieved due to the quarantine?,355,fx7v1p,65,"Don't get me wrong, this is a serious matter and it's sad what is happening. And at the same time, my anxiety is through the roof so it's not like i'm all sunshine and daisies. That said, it's refreshing to not have to find reasons to justify not being able to go out because you are just too terrified of what will happen. And omg the sudden stop of family meetings and having to show up to places, events and so on is so calming. But at the same time this feeling causes me so much guilt because if know i shouldn't ""enjoy"" quarantine, but holy fk is it nice for introverts. I'm just wondering if anyone else relates"
"I know this sounds cliché, but does anyone else feel like they have missed the ""best years"" of their lives?",359,eiqkwu,82,"Basically, I didn't have a ""normal"" adolescence, I lived on a ""never"" basis: *never* had boyfriends, *never* been invited to parties, *never* had best friends, *never* had sexual experiences and it all seems like an abnormal thing. I was a constant target of bullying throughout my teens because of my punk/goth look, and when depression started to form on me, it consumed me a lot and deprived me of so many things. I couldn't fit into anything that the ""normal teenagers"" were venturing into.

So, I just turned 19 yesterday and I started therapy in June, after being hospitalized for attempting suicide, and since then, I've been trying not to give so much importance to those wasted years, but no matter how much I try to leave it behind, it still haunts me. College is about to start soon, and I'm tired of searching and thinking I'm the only person going through all this ""bell jar"" thing.

I'm wondering if anyone has been in this type of position and how you've been dealing/dealt with it."
Does anyone feel so incredibly emotionally vulnerable they want to crawl into bed away from everything and everyone? Just go into an empty room with no stimuli and lie in bed and let their mind go blank?,362,cp4bby,46,"I don’t want to talk to anyone. I don’t want to hear anything. I don’t even want to hear a song on the radio. I don’t want to think about anything. I don’t even want to see a picture. I want to crawl under crisp white sheets and shut my eyes and turn my brain off. It’s like everything will set me off and make me upset, doesn’t matter what it is. Does anyone else feel this sensory and emotional overload?

EDIT: Thank you, everyone, for sharing your thoughts and feelings. I think a lot of us with BPD struggle with shame and a lack of self worth so it can really help to see other people struggling with these issues. It makes us feel a little more, human, I think. 

As for those who have said they don’t know how to turn their brain off, I can relate to that feeling at times as well. Sometimes in order to get by throughout the day I have to....and this might sound a bit weird, but I have to put myself in the “sunken place” (for those of you that haven’t see “Get Out”, it’s a reference from that). I essentially have to push my regular self with all the overwhelming thoughts and emotions, deep somewhere in my psyche, and then I am able to act sort of normal, but in a sort of robotic and superficial way. Not allowing myself to feel or think. Just sort of an autopilot thing. Not sure if anyone else does that 😂 

Also, sorry if that was unnecessary rambling. Lol."
DAE not remember the majority of their life? How am I supposed to do trauma therapy if I don’t remember anything?,360,cl6jkw,68,"Hi! I was diagnosed with BPD and C-PTSD. I have been noticing that I don’t remember at least 85% of my trauma. When I am trying to retell it to my therapist, I get lost, knowing I am missing huge details, am possibly misconstruing it because I don’t remember it, or just making up a huge story. I don’t mean to but I genuinely don’t remember and sometimes my brain will place a false story in my head to fill in the puzzle piece.

When I try to talk to my mom about something I vaguely remember she will be like, “No, that happened (random year)...” or “It didn’t happen (that way), it happened (this way)...”, or she’ll remind me of something I completely forgot. I don’t necessarily want to talk to her though about it because it makes me extremely uncomfortable but I do want to process my trauma. She, also, wasn’t present for a good 60% of it.

How am I supposed to get through my trauma and therapy if I don’t remember it? I am still suffering deeply from it but I can never pinpoint why I feel the way I do because I don’t remember. Anyone relate? Advice?"
"My demands are not irrational, they're human decency",361,ihkzi0,64,"Does anyone else feel like the way the world interacts with one another is so mean? Like we treat each other like shit and then expect us to put up with it. Maybe bpd people aren't just easily triggered, maybe we just don't put up with the constant unpleasantness of the human world.

The idea of ""well you can't expect me not to make that joke because it upsets you"" annoys me. Why not? I'm a human being in your vicenity asking you to be nice.

OK fair enough you really like that edgy joke but it upsets me, so I'm going to remove myself from this situation and avoid content which contains such edgy jokes.

Does anybody else spend too much time in bed?,355,drd1gr,43,"I work, 11-7, get home, get in bed, get high, go to sleep, wake up, repeat. When I'm off work, I'm in bed. If i don't have any responsibility that is essential for me progressing as a person, such as working or university, i stay in bed, its where i spend almost all of my free time that isn't smoking weed with my friends either at their house or on a hiking trip, which i really enjoy doing and helps a lot with breaking the habit, but i keep falling back into this stupid fucking bed. I might get a little crazy and sit on my chair, but that's only when im using my pc. Anybody glued to their bed? It's like my entire life is in this one spot and it's my focal point.

Can anyone relate to this???,362,dmr0d9,32,"Me: *in my darkroom, alone and crying*

Do you ever panic at the change of someones tone,360,djsp5c,24,"I went to help bf carry something from the car and he said something in a bit aggressive tone. Or like clenched, I am not sure how to describe it. He had dropped something on his foot and was frustrated about the pain, but I did not learn that before later.

So ofcourse I immediately assume he is beyond angry with me and hates me. I have literally asked him seven times if he is upset w me as my brain won't stop."
A little disappointed with how fellow students reacted to BPD.,355,bhgz6k,103,"I was in a review session two days ago for my Abnormal Psychology class and we were going over personality disorders since they made up a good portion of our final.

When it came time to answer questions about BPD, I refrained from answering all of them, mostly since I didn't want people to start (rightfully) assuming things about me.

Anyway, as the professor was asking questions and taking answers, I overheard a group of classmates making snarky comments about the illness, like saying, ""maybe my ex had BPD since s/he was so damn clingy"", ""I would go fucking insane being friends with someone like that"", and ""how do those people even have friends?""

I tried not to take it personally, but not only was I sad later for myself, but also for everyone else affected by BPD. The ignorance I witnessed was honestly astounding. I couldn't imagine making those types of comments about any person with any mental illness.

EDIT: wow, I am beyond words as to how much support has been circling on this post. Y'all are wonderful! Some of you mentioned stigma in your comments and I must admit, I was regularly commenting on this sub with my main account but deleted all those comments later because some people in my life know my main username and I didn't want them questioning me, so I've now resorted to my alt account. It really goes to show that the fear and stigma can really get inside our heads and warp our thoughts sometimes."
Open this if you're having a bad day.,354,adio8j,58,"I just want to remind each and every one of you in this sub: your negative thoughts don't define you!!!!!! Please don't forget that even though things probably got hard for all of us last year, we still persevered and we're here today. Things will probably still be hard, but damn you're all so awesome because you're still here. I know a lot of us have suicidal thoughts, but boy are we damn good experts in pulling through. What I've learned since my diagnoses is that BPD is a  shitty disorder. Not only are we forced to battle our own selves at times, but we have to also put up with all the negative stigma that comes with it. We're all fighters who have every right to be loved. Whoever is reading this, don't forget you're an amazing person and you will get through this."

Anyone else literally fooling the world into thinking you’re incredibly stable and well put together?,356,ei3rkd,56,"I think most people who don’t know about my quiet BPD would be absolutely shocked to know I have it. I go to intense lengths to portray myself as absolutely perfect, stable, unaffected by others, etc.  I have two jobs and am working in a masters degree—though I do have trouble with setting work life boundaries. Sometimes I wonder if I just make myself crazy, because obviously I can manage these things that “normal” people are supposed to handle."
Finding the Good in BPD,356,avxyv0,62,"This will likely get downvoted. 

As much as I appreciate this subreddit, it's largely populated by people (understandably) lamenting about BPD. But isn't this tendency to see only the bad in things just another *symptom* of BPD? Isn't this just more all-or-nothing thinking? By only focusing on the negatives of BPD--which, I admit, is all too easy--aren't we only reinforcing our sense of hopelessness and powerlessness? Aren't we just forfeiting our fight against this condition? 

Don't get me wrong. I think BPD is *really* bad. It nearly killed me (who knows, it still might), has killed many, and it will kill a lot more. It's utterly devastating, and anyone who doesn't have it should be grateful to have been spared the psychological agony that many of us experience daily. 

But I no longer think it's *all* bad. I can think of several benefits to having BPD: being fairly good at reading people; having a heightened sense of self-awareness; and having lots of experience with many hobbies/occupations (thanks to the identity disturbance). These are just a few things. 

Now, I'm not saying that these ""benefits"" make BPD worth having. In my case, they don't. I'd rather give these things up than have BPD. 

What I am saying, however, is that we should be more aware of the unique perspectives and abilities that BPD offers each of us who have it, and we should try to integrate these positives into our overall conception of our BPD. To see the entire spectrum of this illness--the bad and the good--is to begin to conquer it. 

I invite criticism of this viewpoint. But I'd also like to hear from anyone who might have found some value--practical or otherwise--in having BPD. 

Thanks. "
i HATE how quickly i jump to suicide when i'm upset,353,k3rlxt,49,"its like the smallest, stupidest shit sends me into a spiral that always ends up in the land of ""i want to die"". no matter how mundane the trigger may be, as long as i've entered an inch into sadness or depression my mind instantly goes *oh my god i wish i was dead.*

no wonder so many people in my past have called me overdramatic, my god. but its not something i can stop or change, its my immediate emotional response. it just spikes when i'm upset, i hate it.

"DAE have ""internal"" tantrums even if you stop the external behavior?",355,jecoju,28,"Anyone else struggle with constant internal tantrums RE friends and jealousy / abandonment?

I'm not lazy,355,m0hd9p,25,"I always felt bad for not helping my wife with the chores. It was so hard for me to do even the bare minimum, I had to muster all my energues to simply do the dishes.

It made me feel like a terrible person and a terrible husband, justifiably.

But after I started therapy and started taking antidepressants I started helping without even noticing.

Yesterday I washed the entire bathroom, not because I had to, but because I felt like cleaning.

It was only today, after my therapy, that I noticed that the past weeks I've been doing more things using less energy.

I think this therapy thing might be working."
I hate when people dismiss my anger just because I’m “having an episode”,353,jxn8og,31,"I don’t think they realise this is just an ACCENTUATION of a thought and/or emotion that I had retained prior (in a state of relative normalcy). People will do this shit all the time to try and deflect the shittiness of their actions as though the severity of my anger can acquit them of accountability- this is why I’m reluctant to tell people about my diagnosis even though sometimes it can make my relationship someone easier; just depends on who I’m dealing with (‘please be a good person, please be a good person’). The Russian roulette of BPD is fucking exhausting..."
People don't talk enough about Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and I thought I should talk about it to anyone struggling with self compassion.,353,j7nomf,36,"I feel like everyone here is at least somewhat familiar with DBT, which is categorized into 4 sections of skills: Mindfulness (skills for all situations when using other 3 sections of skills), Distress Tolerance (skills to use when higher on the crisis scale), Emotion Regulation (skills to use when lower to middle on the crisis scale) and Interpersonal Skills (skills to use when interacting with others while lower on the crisis scale). Basically it consists of several skills used to help regulate and calm down emotions.

ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) is something else entirely. It's biggest focus is self compassion and acceptance. Similar to how in DBT there is emotion mind and logic mind and the ideal wise mind, in ACT there is psychological rigidity and psychological flexibility with the goal being flexibility. With psychological flexibility you can live your life with acceptance of all things good and bad, let go of negative thoughts, live according to your values, make actions to live the life you want, live in the present moment, and not define yourself by the things that have happened in your life or negatively held false beliefs about yourself.

I feel like self-hate and BPD go hand in hand for a lot of people. That is why one of the absolute most important possible things to do for recovery is practicing self compassion. Try to be kind to yourself as much as you can. Try to find reasons to like yourself and repeat them to yourself as often as possible. Is that easy? No. It takes a lot of effort and practice.

Acceptance can be a really hard thing too. Especially where trauma is concerned. It isn't easy to accept awful things that happened or unpleasant present situations, but acceptance doesn't mean viewing it in a positive light either. It just means that you are no longer avoiding it. Avoidance leads to more pain, which is why acceptance is so important.

Thought defusion is a big part of ACT as well. Ever get caught in a negative chain of thoughts and start directing negative comments at yourself and thinking you're a failure? Defusion is the ability to detach from those thoughts and observe them without attaching to them. ""I am having a thought that I am worthless"" vs ""I am worthless."" You simply observe without judgment and without attaching yourself to the thoughts.

So there's a little summary of the main points of ACT. I just thought I'd throw that out there to anyone who might benefit from it. I'm honestly not sure how it is taught most of the time since I learned about it in group therapy during treatment. I'm fairly certain many people do it one on one with a therapist. I don't believe it is strongly encouraged to be done in groups the way DBT is since it is less about skills and more about your personal thoughts and feelings."
does anyone feel split between two ages?,347,fn8c7s,43,"I feel as though there's two versions of me; one that is eternally childlike, and another that was prematurely mature, and that I switch between the two depending on the situation. I collect dolls, I watch mostly kids TV shows, read kids books, etc, but I've also been engaging in reckless and dangerous substances and relationships since I was fifteen. The weird thing is, when I'm in that 'childlike' state I don't feel responsible for the behavior? I don't know how to explain it any better than a feeling of ""oh, that wasn't me"", completely confident. When I catch myself switching, it feels really fucking weird, though---like the other day I was reading Harry Potter or something, and then got a text and started making plans for sleeping with this guy---and all of a sudden I felt just disgusted and repulsed by my younger self, had to put down the book, lock myself in the bathroom to calm down because I felt so weird.

So fucking tired of the judgment. Thank god my family have no idea about the stigma. Sadly I've faced the stigma irl as well as online.

Fuck them. I'm not abusive. I have morals. I am not evil. I'm a partially broken sensitive woman whose had a shitty childhood. I'm trying my hardest to survive. I'm not hurting anyone. I'm not fucking evil, fuck off."
"I just want to tell you guys that I’m clean from alcohol as of two months, despite severe bpd and general anxiety :) wasn’t easy at all.",353,cnu4ds,39,"But if you are going through the same thing- and I had a bottle (a fifth to be exact) of vodka a day habit, and I’m only 18- then I truly think you can do it too. I have faith and much hope in you. I can say without a lick of doubt that life is better without alcohol to self medicate. 

My anxiety was actually worse when I was drinking, even while completely shit-faced, black out drunk. 

You can do this. This is the hardest condition to live with, both bpd and drinking. It won’t be easy. But I planned to go to rehab/detox in a week, before I ended up going into withdrawal, ending up in the hospital, before I reached the next week.

I hope you gained hope from this. Stay safe, and I love you."

Today marks 6 months I am drug free!!,351,lcb99s,67,"Needless to say I am very proud of myself and ecstatic I got here!

For the past 11 years, since I was 20yo I have been an every day marijuana smoker more often than not. I've been into detox facilities before and have had time off it but it was only ever a few weeks before I was back on it, apart from 9 months off it in 2018. I did well in 2018 and quit cigarettes for the last 3 of those 9 months but eventually fell to both again after struggling a bit and being around friends who are every day smokers.

The past 6 months have been the best 6 months of my life though! It is very different this time compared to quitting previously as I was diagnosed with BPD 2 weeks after quitting marijuana and I've changed so much of my life since. Just the fact of getting off weed and finding suitable full time work has changed my brain chemistry astronomically! Then add regular and healthy eating, regular exercise, finding my hobbies and my happiness, and finding the right therapy, and it's safe to say I feel and AM a completely different person to who I've ever been!

If anyone reading this is struggling just know recovery IS possible! You can do it if you persist! There will be tough times and it will be a journey but you can do it! Happy to answer any questions or offer advice if anyone needs it :)"

"""Don't go BPD on me!""",348,i5v3vf,43,"I wasn't.

We're having problems. You clearly aren't happy with me at the moment, and my breakdown (a long time coming) a few days ago was badly timed - but i didn't take it out on you. I sobbed upstairs, on the phone to my parents, and then I came downstairs once I'd calmed down. I calmly told you that they were coming to get me and take me to the doctor. I apologised for being a mess, explained that my mental health had been all over the place for a while.

You didn't even know. You couldn't even tell. You said the very words,

""Sometimes I forget you have mental health problems.""

And you didn't mean it in a horrible way. You meant it in such a way that means I'm doing a fucking good job of keeping myself in check around you. But, it also means that you don't recognise when I'm starting to fall apart. It also means that you don't realise how hard losing several jobs, being told many times by you over the year that I have no personality anymore, that I don't do anything, being broken up with by you (even if it only lasted a few days) has been and the toll it's taken on me.

I've tried explaining it. More than once. You've lost patience with that explanation.

**EDIT:** You were, however, supportive when I said that I was going to go to the doctor. You were sorry I was feeling awful, you gave me a big hug, you offered to drive me to their house yourself. You reassured me that we didn't have a problem as long as I took my meds and didn't just sit around pondering my feelings, as long as I actually was proactive and made an effort with life. I appreciated your support, as it made me feel more comfortable leaving.

So I came to stay with my parents so I could get medication again, and then I'm honest with you via text and say I'm anxious about coming home. Normal, I think, after our turbulent few days. And you tell me I should stay with my parents for longer, as it'll give you some breathing room and me some time to relax. Fine, yeah? Understandable. I get it. I'm not upset about that. It's been ages since you've needed breathing room from me.

But then I ask you to let me know if you're leaning towards nö longer being able to be with me, because I'd find it easier to deal with if I had some warning. After our argument and your comments of before - more of me not being myself anymore, not doing enough, the fact that you have to earn all the money whilst I wait for my job to start, that I do nothing other than housework, telling me that I'm a layabout, that you are finding me less attractive because of these things - I feel like it's a reasonable request. I feel that it's been tumultuous and I'd understand if you were in that frame of mind, especially with some space away from me to think things over.

I was calm. I didn't get overemotional. My exact words were:

""Just, please... if you're having doubts about staying with me, don't keep me in the dark. If you think that might be where you're heading, I'd rather know so I can start dealing with it. I hope that's OK. I only say it because I know that when you have time alone, it may bring some sort of clarity.""

And you respond saying you 'knew I'd jump to that assumption', told me you just thought it would be good to have some time to ourselves.

And then, 'so don't go BPD on me!'

...

Considering I've had a breakdown, didn't make you deal with it or even see it until you absolutely had to know about it because I was going to the doctor in my hometown and am clearly feeling a lot of guilt for having a breakdown just a day after an argument... well, I'd have hoped you wouldn't throw that sort of thing at me.

'Don't go BPD on me!'

I hardly, if ever, lose my shit around you. I've cried a lot over the past year, sure, but that's it. I don't scream at you. I don't abuse you. I don't manipulate you. Sometimes I have to check in, ask if we're okay, but after our break up where you told me you didn't love me anymore I think it's reasonable for me to take some time to get over that, even if we did get back together and you took it back. I know it's been months, but I still feel it's pretty reasonable.

What if I said to you, when you're stuck in a mindset or going through a tough time, 'don't go autistic on me!' - how would YOU feel? Or, 'don't go depressive on me!' - how would YOU take that? Wouldn't it hurt you, too? Wouldn't you want me to be more understanding? Just a little kinder?

I responded calmly. I said I didn't feel as if I were, that I thought it was actually reasonable in these turbulent times to have that thought process. But then I capitulated, said okay, wished you a good time to yourself and a great sleep when it came.

And now, this morning. Silence. Understandably, perhaps.

But it hurt, love. It didn't feel good. I wish you hadn't said it, when I work so fucking hard to keep my mental illness from being present in our relationship.

It was unkind. It made me question myself. It made me feel that my concerns were completely invalid.

I wish you hadn't said it."
I cleaned my room today for the first time in god knows how long,352,f5t6ee,23,"This is a super minor victory, but I figured I should celebrate it, or at least share it with someone.

I know I will bounce back, a lot of this is cyclic for me, but I feel like I’m constantly underwater and I just wanted to pump the breaks."

"Daydreaming yourself as someone else, a more ideal version of yourself, or a fictional character?",350,gst4ce,50,"One of the activities that consume my day is listening to music and daydreaming scenarios or stories based around the music. I never really imagine myself though, or at least not the person I see when I look in the mirror. I’ve pushed people away just to do this; along with losing precious time just to sit and waste away in daydreaming. I get so lost in these daydreams and it makes me feel better in a way. This behavior can be noted when I was younger too and would play pretend characters all the time, typical kid behavior except I would do it for weeks.

When I daydream, I’ll imagine myself in the perspective of my own characters I created, or ones from games I’ve played. Often wishing I really were this person. I’ll imagine myself in a fantasy world where I may even be the opposite gender character. Im not gender dysphoric and aren’t unhappy being a female so I’m a little baffled why. Im not sure if me feeling like my life holds no purpose is the reason to why I maladaptive daydream. Thinking of myself as a character in a story gives me importance, and the other people in my fantasy world are in my head so I’m not scared of them like I am real people because I control the scenario. Video games aren’t enough because in online games theres people which I highly dread.

I’m decently skilled in arts and crafts (despite my economic situation holding me back) I’ve thought about genuinely creating costumes and things for these characters I have created and living them out to help how much I daydream. However reality is reality and I know people would consider me a freak show, and my only good relationship I’ve ever had may suffer too. My family would look down upon me as well. 

So in conclusion, anyone have any advice or similar experiences?
Edit: I also have an unholy obsession with mask, like the idea of being able to conceal yourself and be elusive makes me giddy."

BPD is unbearable in 1st person, but it is also insufferable in 3rd person unless you take years of time and effort to mitigate the symptoms.

What I fucking hate is these disgusting pieces of shit (most of whom are on Twitter) who don't suffer from any mental illness but capitalize on the misery of people like ours for social brownie points. Because mental illness for better or worse is a popular topic nowadays; the very mention of it is attention-grabbing and these ass vultures capitalize on that for their shitty websites that no one would visit if not for buzzwords like these.

I can guarantee you that most of these insufferably woke cunts would bail at the first sign of someone suffering from actual mental illness. I'm saying this because I know a lot of them in real life. **Of course, there are genuine people posting this with good intentions, but social media has given everyone a voice to be equally cunty so their voices get overpowered by the most vocal who take advantage of this.**

Does anyone else constantly hate the way you handle situations?,352,mjnmlc,33,"It doesn’t matter whether I handled a situation appropriately or not, I’ll still beat myself up over it

One day, I’ll look back and hate myself for being too harsh to someone and the next I’ll hate myself for being too calm and there’s never any in between

It gets really distressing having to deal with these thoughts because they consume me"
Anyone else struggling with emotional eating/ over eating?,348,m1il9r,69,"I’m an emotional eater. Everything makes me want to eat. Eating food makes me feel so good (at the time) and it means I struggle with my weight. 

Being overweight further impacts my mood and self image so I go on diets. However, I find it really hard to stick to them. I’m addicted to food and I don’t know how to overcome this. I lost lots of weight and I put it all back on and more in a really short amount of time, around 42lbs I put on because I just wouldn’t stop eating. I need to lose the weight to get to a healthy weight but I can’t seem to control my appetite for long periods.

Anyone who struggles with their relationship to food I’d love to hear about how you manage or cope with this!

Does anyone else feel absolutely drained at the beginning of the day just because you have stuff you have to do?,349,hnkqn9,31,"Hi.

6 month ago I started a new part time job while studying, I became an English teacher in a language school. I have only 2 or 3 students per day and I don't work on weekends, sometimes I even have some free days during the week if students cancel or move their lessons. 

On the days when I do have some lessons, I feel so emotionally and also physically drained right from the beginning. I literally don't (can't) do anything else since 8am because ""I have a lesson at 4pm"" as if it made any sense.

I just watched a video from a guy studying at Harvard, he had so much to do for the whole day, he basically came out of his house at 7am and came back at 7pm. And for some reason, it gave me anxiety. I mean on one side I do want to be like him, I really do, it seems awesome to actually have productive days most of the time, but on the other side, I know I'm always extremely anxious when I have more than a few things to do during the day. But when I'm thinking about it, it's normal for people to do things throughout the whole day and use their time fully. I wish I could do that too.

Does anyone else have this as well?"
I fantasize about how everyone I know would react if I killed myself,347,gskbl9,25,"I find myself often fantasizing; not exactly on dying but how my family or people I know would react if I killed myself. Would they miss me? Would they act like they new me so well? They might say they remember good times with me but I don’t think of myself as a very nice person or a good person to be around most of the time. Would the book I’m writing blow up after I die? That would be cool. I would want everyone to know what I stand for and that inside I hide so much anguish and pain.

Edit: * but at the same time, I have so much passion and courage"

DAE BPD symptoms flare up when you're in love?,348,dh3xya,78,"Intense mood swings, splitting, suicidal thoughts etc anyone else? bc i feel this way when im in love. it's like my emotions are on steroid."

DAE not know what they like to do for fun or how to fill their time?,345,koyjay,44,"I don't know what I enjoy. Well I do, I enjoy reading and gaming etc, but at the same time the thought of doing it doesn't make me happy or doesn't seem interested. Like my SO can happily game for hours without a care in the world and I just sit there and do nothing because unless I'm doing something with him, it all seems pointless. I'll even deliberately go to sleep just to fast forward my life. I don't know how to fill my time with anything fun or meaningful without my SO."
DAE go on binge shopping sprees until you’re almost out of money?,349,ielfmx,61,"I have an impulse problem with buying a shit ton of things on amazon even if I know I don’t need it or can’t afford it. I need to become better with budgeting . It’s like the emptiness inside me is filled in that moment with random things I don’t really need, just want. Same thing with self harm, sex and alcohol. It fills me temporarily but when the “high” goes away I’m left empty again. If I stop abusing alcohol, I start abusing weed, if I stop weed I’ll pick up a new vice. I’ll watch porn hours, if I stop watching porn I’ll move on to buying things. If I quit buying things I impulsively skip meals or fast for days at a time to lose weight. It’s like it is never enough. Once I made these risky choices I’m at a loss and flooded by feelings of regret and self hate. I’m reading a Dave Ramsey book because my dad is a huge fan of him when it comes to money and using it wisely. Maybe I’ll get some insight from it.

Edited to add another thought I had."
"What people dont understand about borderlins: its not just the strong emotions that hurt, its also how fast those emotions change",352,fkd1gt,41,Unlike other mental illnesses BPD isn't all about the strong emotions. While yes it is its also the confusion of how fast they change and shift its about the splitting on people the changing of opinions and sudden bursts of emotion to just 10 minutes later feeling nothing. Its how fast it all moves sometimes you want it to all slow down so your emotions can catch up. The sudden changes and shifts is a big part of it. I wish people who i spoke to about it understood this
DAE have 24/7 existential thoughts like you can't enjoy things because you too preoccupied thinking how this moment and everything's fleeting.,351,csuc4x,20,I can't help escape the existential dread. It's a paradox because part of me just wants to die then another part is so affraid of dying and the inevitability of death. I worry so much about the ones around me dying like I can literally start crying and have a panic attack in the middle of the night listening to my S/O heartbeat knowing his heart could just stop beating at any minute. I get triggered seeing my parents skin on their hands becoming thinner and fragile. I started crying to my mum yesterday because she has one of those bruises on her hands you get when you are older. I am constantly plagued with worry my dad will get dementia and this also sends me into a spiral of negative emotions. I think how short our time is here and try to make the most of the moments but when I am actually with my parents I usually just end up being super negative and get triggered so we don't even have good times together then I feel guilt afterwards. I am also painfully aware that these are supposed to be the best years of my life (25) yet I am throwing them all away with worry and pushing ppl away and everything else that comes with BPD and I know later in life I will look back and wish I didn't waste all these years but I can't stop myself. Ughgh this post is probably rambly but please tell me I'm not alone. I work in healthcare also which may be in part where all the health anxiety comes from. Sometimes I wish I was like an animal and had no awareness of our mortality.
Is our intuition extremely strong or do we just get paranoid and believe that what we think is happening is actually happening every time?,347,lhfn2r,74,"Sometimes I really feel like my intuition is extremely accurate and I just KNOW what’s happening even if I have little to no proof. Like, I can read when someone let something slip that I wasn’t supposed to know and I can put the pieces together and a lot of the time it ends up being what I thought. Or is that just complete paranoia and anxiety? Ugh, I just love being kept up late by my brain’s wonderful detective work.

(Side note: my DBT therapist does interject pretty often and remind me that I’m actually not a mind reader while I’m talking to her, so maybe it is just anxiety, lol.)"
DAE get paranoid thoughts of being talked badly behind their backs by others?,348,kngoo5,49,"Perhaps this is due to my personal childhood trauma of finding out that my best friend backstabbed me and talked badly about me behind my back and i happen to be close by to hear it, but recently, I've been getting into these loop thoughts for almost the entire day like my old friends who i've long parted ways with are making fun of me behind my back to their new group of friends, thoughts such as: making fun of my looks, photos, face, or my personality, or just how i am, it just scares me and makes me feel so vulnerable, fearful, and crushed, i also have perfectionism and hold myself to a high standard but there were times when i had very ugly and bad photos taken and posted it online which i should not have posted, i keep getting paranoid thoughts like they are making fun of them. I would imagine it, visualize it happening in my head, and it feels so real, not to mention i am an open and honest person and often spew out my insecurities and vulnerabilities alot, just a very transparent person, and this can be taken advantage of by very bad people.

this made me not only lash out irrationally when i begin believing the paranoid thoughts to be true, but also made me avoidant of interaction with others in the future."
DAE suffer from intense misophonia (aggitation due to sound)?,347,khat5p,166,"I'm trying to figure out if this is a separate issue to my BPD or if other BPD sufferers are also prone to accute misophonia.

For me its less someone chewing, as is commonly described as a trigger for sufferers of misophonia; I find any sound that is louder than the surrounding environment is distracting, and most of the time when i am stressed, infuriating. 

I am currently sitting in the doctors office awaiting an appointment and the sound of the receptionist talking on the phone and people talking in the waiting room is overwhelmingly annoying and frustrating. God forbid something gets banged and dropped, the noise cuts through my brain like a hot knife. 

Its much worse when i am stressed, normally my medication (seroquil) helps ease this symptom but lately its not helping, I have been under more stress than usual due to a number of things so I am guessing that is whats left my resilience to sound lower than normal. 

It can make me full on crack though, loud noise can make me turn into an angerbeast. Part of me wonders if I am on the spectrum, as lots of my research indicates this audio sensitivity is common for people on the spectrum, but I'm not a doctor so that is all purely uneducated speculation.

Does anyone else with a BPD diagnosis have severe reactions to sound?"
Anybody else gets ridiculously angry over a lack of communication or being left out of the loop?,342,ckokir,22,"For someone with social anxiety, I sure as hell do value communication a lot. I can't read minds, I don't know or understand social cues, I don't ""take hints"" (and have no interest in doing so, I am a grown ass adult with working ears and eyes — talk to me!). So when someone refuses to talk about something important, it gets on my last nerve. 

What really gets me personally is when you apply to a job, and they're like ""Communication is key! uWu"" and then you show up and it's like, you're background noise. You send an email, you don't get a reply for days but you sure as hell know that later emails are being taken care of. You go see the person face to face and either they don't listen, right in your face, then you just stand there looking foolish, or they tell you they will look into it. Days later, nothing. So you go back and they're like ""Oh, you still need me?"" BITCH, YES THE FUCK I DO? DID YOU DO ANYTHING???

I'm big mad."

Sorry for the rant, I just... I hate this. Hugs to all of you, especially if you're having a bad day.

&#x200B;

I'm having problems with my phone and I can't seem to solve them, despite trying several things, and I'll probably have to take it to the service store, which also means having to tell all of that to my parents, which means I'll probably be hearing ""that's because you're on your phone all the time"" again - which is not true btw - and I'm just so frustrated right now because I absolutely hate not being able to fix problems like this and having to tell others that I'm having issues with anything and I just feel like I want to throw something across the room or punch something, which is kinda funny because I didn't use to be the person who had those kind of urges, so yknow, I'm evidently not getting any better with my mental health, all of which just makes me want to do a bit of self harm, which I know isn't the productive thing here, but boy does it sound good right now.

Right now, I'd really like to just go settle down in the middle of some forest without technology (save for my music player) and be alone with my books and nature..."
"I have a habit of repeatedly asking those around me ""Are you ok?"" when I'm not. Anyone else experience this?",343,agnl21,45,"I don't know why this happens, it's kind of a reflex but I've noticed when I'm feeling less than ok I ask this of those around me. Repeatedly. To the point where they say ""yes, you keep asking me that."" I feel bad being annoying because it's not intentional but I'm not sure how to stop. I'm not sure if it's specific to BPD or what but I thought I'd ask. "
Does anyone else have fake conversations in your head?,341,j4vx93,43,I constantly find my self almost like having fake conversations with all old past friends I had that cared for me and I treated them so poorly and I just find myself apologizing to them and how I wish I could do things differently but deep down I know if I make new friends I'll do the same exact thing and deep down I know I'm probably better off alone
DAE feel so insecure about themselves that they can barely look at attractive people?,350,fkti67,45,"I can barely watch movies or youtube videos or heck even look at porn because it triggers extreme insecurities within me. I’m straight but I always used to appreciate female beauty, I never treated other girls as my competition. But now I literally can’t look at an attractive girl without feeling intense hatred towards them. I work in customer service and every time I have to interact with a pretty girl I want to start crying and pulling out my hair. Also, I am a POC and the eurocentric idea of beauty really gets to me. I wish I was white and had blonde hair and blue eyes and I just hate how I look currently. No matter who I date they will always find someone else more attractive than me and if they choose to stay with me it will only be because of my “personality.” I don’t want that. I want to have plastic surgery and change all my facial features. I have small boobs and I want to get surgery to have them enlarged. I just want to be pretty and have the pretty girl privilege people talk about. 
I am having a complete breakdown right now and don’t know how to deal with it."
"You can do anything you want to. I have BPD and I’m ready to help break the stigma around this disorder. Remember people ARE NOT BORN with BPD. It develops as you get older. We are not bad people. Let’s send out good vibes whenever possible, and don’t let ANYONE tell you you’re a bad person.",349,c2af0s,77,"Remember back when you were a kid and you were optimistic and honest and strong and you wanted to take the world by the horns? You still can!

I remember when I turned 18 I felt bad, I started exhibiting really strong suicidal thoughts and feelings when I was about 21. I have been through so much since I turned 21 and was able to legally drink.

I received my diagnosis in February of 2018, while in rehab for a month stay. I am now 24 and realize what I have to do and I have seen my psychiatrist 3 times in a row now, working on medication, and my therapist 2 times in a row now. It’s taken me a long time to accept help.

But I’m ready to turn my life around and be positive and happy again. I’m ready to care about myself again.

So after this backstory I want to say that you can still do anything you want to regardless of your diagnosis or if you suspect you have a diagnosis. I want you to know you are loved and together we can break the stigma that people who have to live through the HELL of BPD, are among the smartest, nicest, most talented people IN THE WORLD. I love you all, good vibes."
I get so happy when people upvote/respond to my posts,346,9ico5w,34,But it also usually triggers a landslide into depression when my posts are ignored. How trivial and pathetic am I? L O L
I got a new hobby and haven't given up after day one,344,ljkpnj,32,"It was my birthday yesterday and my boyfriend spent over $300 on me to get rollerskates, padding, a helmet, and cute socks. I've been interested in it for a while and I finally took the plunge. Today I did it for the first time, just on a basketball court, and had a lot of moments of ""why can't I do this?"", ""I should give up before I embarrass myself further"", ""I'm never gonna get good at this, it's too hard"", etc.

I did about 20 minutes straight of falling, going nowhere, somehow going backwards, it wasn't working out. I was getting so frustrated because I couldnt do it, I was sweating an ungodly amount even for me, my breathing was all over the place, I even felt sick. I went home really unhappy with myself.

But I waited about 6 hours, watched some ""for beginners"" videos and tried again in my garage and I did it! It was only for a few seconds and I definitely celebrated way too early because after saying out loud to myself ""I'm doing it! I'm doing it! Oh my god"" and laughing I promptly fell but I wasn't put off from trying again.

Because I went back and tried again, I'm confident that I'll get the hang of it over time. I keep reminding myself of things I've done that took literal years to have any skill at. I played tennis for 12 years, I played the keyboard and the cornet for over 10 years and I can read music, I can bake and cook and there's so many little things I can do too that I know I was never going to be good at on day one. I can do this!"
One year sober today,343,kp91hg,38,"In November 2019, my fb left me due my addiction and it sent me into the worst downward spiral I'd ever been in. I ended up in jail and nearly died from high blood pressure. That's what got me sober though, and it got rid of my fear of abandonment. Despite the pandemic, I made some of the most worthwhile friendships online and I want to thank everyone on here for all of your support. I could not have done it alone 💕💕🎉"
DAE randomly find them selves disgusted by human behaviour.,344,iq5o5j,80,"I can be happily socialising when I’m attacked by a feeling of disgust because of how ‘human’ people are. An example could be , that someone is vocal about feeling pain, which would then irritate me because of their feebleness. Another example could be that I’m watching someone enjoy food, and I find it completely ridiculous and disgusting. It’s basically like , every now and then , when someone else shows emotion, it can really anger me for no rational reason. Most of the time, however I have no problem with other people, I really don’t get why I get this overwhelming feeling sometimes."
A rant about this thing they call “emptiness”,343,e6dl0i,42,"Emptiness doesn’t even describe it. Loneliness doesn't even come close. That’s what it’s called yeah, and those are some of the worst symptoms, but the way I would describe it is a lot different. 

It’s a deep, twisting, painful knot that burns so fucking deep. It’s like a scream that’s just waiting to come out, that could howl so loud for so long. It’s like your insides are being torn apart until they collapse and turn into nothing. Your heart throbs and feels like it’s being SQUEEZED. It’s like a black, thick, murky, violent wave that washes into your head and fills your mind with thoughts that don’t stop and are so strong it takes away your vision and makes you see in black and white. 

It’s like you were plucked from another planet, and put on this earth. No one thinks the same way you do, no one feels the way you do, and you never EVER feel like you truly belong. It’s like you live on a cloud that’s floating through a meaningless life. No matter how many people are texting you, how many people you talk to, laugh with you, hang out with you, you never truly feel in the right place. Always like an OUTSIDER. Or an intruder. Always asking people “Are you sure I’m ok here? Are you sure you want to come? Are you sure you want to hang out with me?” “You’re not mad at me? Are you sure? How come you don’t like me? Are you taking behind my back?” etc. 

No one will ever feel emotions the same way you do. Emotions that are so intense they run so deep. When you’re feeling down, you are crippled by thoughts that tell you everything that’s going wrong right now. And why everything sucks and nothing is ever right and nothing is ever going to change the way you feel. When you experience something positive and happy, you feel like this is the best life you've ever lived and sometimes that feeling is amazing there’s something almost spiritual about it. You feel amazing, you're confident in yourself, you feel like you’re almost meant to be here… and then you come back down and those moments don't even matter anymore and that they may as well have never even happened… but they do?? And they did happen?? Why can’t you remember those moments and choose to remember and live by those? But no, the bad moments have to define you. The bad moments always come back and you become that bad person you know yourself to be again. The sad, angry, ugly person you’re comfortable with. You relive everything that’s ever gone wrong in your life again and you play it over and over again until you feel that deep, twisting knot that burns so fucking deep. And it happens all over. Again. And again. And again."
One of the things I hate most about BPD...,347,czptra,47,"I would say it's when you haven't heard from someone you care about in a while, and your mind wanders, then the calculations begin. You start doing some sort of screwed up math in your head, and it's always some voice litigating against you. You put yourself on trial. You're in court, and we're working to confirm your guilt. You ruined things. You are why they aren't communicating. You're defective. YOU. YOU. YOU.

Dammit. Dammit. Dammit.

I just hate it. But I've been getting better at reserving judgement. I keep saying ""It ain't over 'till it's over"".

And then... just like that, I hear from the person, and guess f--king what, it's positive or neutral, and things are fine on their end. But on my end, I just tortured the living crap out of myself for that balance of time.

I want anyone suffering to know that it's not just you. It's a lot of others. No one here seeking help should feel alone. I post and try to be helpful to assist with these feelings. It helps. I hope the mods know that I really do appreciate this forum. I mean that.

EDIT: Many hours and too much beer later, I bring up a window and come back here and just... wow. It reminds me of the lyrics in ""Message In A Bottle"" by the Police:

Walked out this morning  
Don't believe what I saw  
A hundred billion bottles  
Washed up on the shore  
Seems I'm not alone at being alone  
A hundred billion casatways  
Looking for a home

"after today, i will have completed my first pay period working a full 40 hours each week since my release from inpatient!",343,ci1jbx,32,"i cant believe that 4 months ago i thought my life would never improve and i could never be productive in society. now i have a job i love, a strong support system, and a great treatment team. it wasn’t easy working up to it, but now i can actually complete 40 hour work weeks without having anxiety attacks or bouts of dissociation that prevent me from doing my job. it’s really small, but it’s a victory for me. i’m feeling really confident about the upcoming college semester for the first time ever! 

i wish everyone in this sub the best. i really couldn’t have done it without all of your support. best wishes to everyone 💕"
They’re not about you the way you’re about them.,345,c5q8w3,47,"We all know that feeling when you feel love so deeply at random times. You appreciate every single thing about a person. You want to cherish them and give them all your love and affection. There comes a point where I’ve realized that BPD makes that love amplified to a point where it’s too much. I realized that the people I appreciate the most, they might not appreciate me the same way in return. There has to be a separation between fantasy and reality and that’s the hardest part for me to find. I have to remember that no matter how kind or loving I am towards someone, that will never make them change their minds about me.
How bittersweet BPD is, being capable of loving so deeply yet being so aware that it’s not reality and it’s just in my head."
Spoke to a psychiatrist today. He said something really good.,344,lkgjpw,67,"I’ve had BPD most of my adult life but only received a diagnosis last year. 
He asked me what my mental health goals were. I told him i just want to be feel stable. I’m so fed up of being up and down up and down, and I’m so done with constantly being terrified of abandonment and doing everything in my power, no matter how negatively it affects me, to keep people in my life.
He’s entering me in a 12 week programme called ‘Living with your personality disorder’. He runs it but he works with people who are ‘in recovery’. He said I will meet people with BPD who are ‘stable’. 
They have partners, they are married and they have kids. They lead pretty normal (for lack of a better word) lives.
He said sooo much other stuff but that stuck with me. That there are people out there with BPD who are stable and can hold down relationships. I know these people exist but sometimes it can be so hard to picture that they exist but I’ll actually meet them and hear their success stories. Because right now I can never, ever see myself being able to do that because i’m so unstable. 
It’s nice to be able to look to the future and think it might not be all doom and gloom :) 
I’m really excited to start this course."
It's so scary not knowing what you actually look like.,343,l9z90g,41,"I forget what I look like that sometimes when there's a reflective surface and I see someone approaching me, it takes me a while to realize it's just my reflection. 

I know what I'd  LIKE to look like but as for my actual form, I have no clue. I don't even see myself as an actual person. I feel like a bunch of traits and obsessions wrapped up in skin. There's a line in America Pyscho that's always resonated  me : ""There is an idea of Patrick  Bateman. ...Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me: only an entity, something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable... I simply am not there.""

It's unbearable but also I take some kind of comfort in feeling like life isn't really happening for me.

Edit: I feel like I should have been institutionalized a long time ago but thank Herrgott that no one actually pays attention to me enough to hospitalize me."
DAE have no sense of self?,343,hzh4zf,45,"My whole life I feel like I’ve conformed to the people I’m around. I pick up bits and pieces of other personalities and incorporate them into my own because I don’t know who I am. I’m constantly on a different diet, never happy with my body, looks, or personality. I’m constantly wanting people to like me, so I change accordingly. Sometimes I just wonder what I’d be like if I was truly myself and happy with her- whoever that is."
Why do people think it's okay to make me a low priority?,346,fuh1xv,111,"I dunno if they do it on purpose or not, but seeing other people chat and post online while my messages go unanswered hurts. Then I gaslight myself into thinking I'm just overreacting, otherwise I think I'd just go insane. 

I don't think it's that hard to even just say ""Hey I'm busy I'll talk to you in a bit"", but I don't even get that luxury from people. It's like I only exist in their lives when they want me to."
My pwBPD is the greatest blessing of my entire life,342,cxy6ig,67,"A little background: I dated a girl with BPD for a bit over a year and she was the most influential thing to ever come across my life. The most amazing, beautiful soul I’ve ever met, and someone I’m fully aware has the problems she has. 

After we split up, I started to read a lot about BPD. I started to understand that she isn’t the girl I knew in the idealization phase. That the issues that seemed surmountable became less and less possible for me to properly deal with. She made me aware of my own issues and called me out on them in a way no girlfriend has had the balls to do before. She held me accountable and didn’t put up with my shit and for that I feel she has helped make me a better man. But through this, nasty arguments ensued, we tore each other down, and we let the stresses of life impact our relationship. We took a break, she found someone else, and within a couple months, after so much lost trust and pain, we found a way back to each other. In a way. 

Reading about BPD so extensively allowed me to stop taking things personally and start showering her with the unconditional love she deserves. We started hanging out again and our chemistry was as amazing as ever. But this time around, when she would overreact to something, I’d tell her I’m understanding her feelings and give her some time. When she’d say something about her past that could be judged, I’d welcome it with open arms. When she’d talk about an impulsive idea i know is a bad one but I know she’d change her mind about it tomorrow anyway, I’d just encourage it and allow her to bask in her excitement. When she wants to go out and party and see friends and network, I’d stop giving her subliminal pressure that I didn’t want that. When she feels a certain way about something that I can’t fully relate to, I appreciate and respect and show understanding for her feelings. We aren’t officially back together as a lot of the damage is still fresh. But we’ve been seeing each other everyday now just about.

My point is this. Much of the content on the internet focused around how impossible it is to maintain a relationship with a pwBPD. Painting people with it out to be some type of monsters. From an outside perspective and a logical one, this girl is bad for me. But every relationship takes work. This girl is so special to me that it’s worth the extra work. There are so many positive amazing qualities associated with BPD and I understand who she is revolves a lot around this and her past trauma and abuse. It took me time, but I’ve learned to fully embrace and accept that. The bad does not outweigh the joy I get. Spending time with her feels better than when I made my first million. (Broke again). She has truly brought color into my world. She is not mine and I do not own her, but I don’t care what she does, I will always be her rock. 

TLDR; fell in love with a girl with BPD and went through common phases and a relationship fallout. Saw what I lost and embraced the negatives and my attitude. She doesn’t idealize me anymore, her true self is what shows. And her true self is more beautiful than anything I’ve ever experienced. The good and the bad. BPD does not own you or dictate where you end up in life. You just experience things in a different way like we all do. Work with your partners. There are people out there who will never abandon you, but still give you space if you need it. To some of us, you are the driving force in our lives. 🖤"
I simultaneously feel like I'm stuck as a child but at the same time feel so old and tired due to the shit I had to endure.,347,9l73fe,37,
Does anyone else forget?,345,lpsxdm,34,"When you feel normal?  Does anyone else forget what it feels like to be hopeless, sad, angry, etc. when you feel normal? Like you forget the pain or how pain feels like. You don’t understand why people are depressed, why people wants to die or why people would end their life. Its as if you never experienced those things. I feel so confused rn."
Realization,346,lio8xy,59,"I was watching this video on BPD traits and I realized something that’s kind of shifted my perspective of BPD. I realized that most of us are just abandoned souls seeking the love we never got as children. I know that’s such an obvious statement but I always thought of myself as someone that’s manipulative and selfish. But watching this video reminded me of what my doctor said while I was inpatient. She said that my behavior is comparable to that of a baby. The only way a baby knows to express their needs to their caretaker is by crying. For some of us it’s similar- there are certain behaviors of ours that aren’t meant to be harmful but may translate that way but that’s the only way for us to express what we need from a loved one, that we know of. We just have to learn healthier ways to express said needs. All the clinginess, relationship anxiety, codependency, having an fp, it’s all just wanting to be loved and cared for. Or at least I feel like that is the case for me. Any thoughts on this? I’d love to hear everyone’s opinions and experiences.


Here’s the video I was referring to with my response: 

https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe8kvwkP/"
I just want to not care so much about people who don’t care about me,342,gjwy7t,47,"Ever feel like committing suicide just to prove to people how much pain they’ve caused you? I know it’s extremely toxic. But sometimes I want to just kill myself to punish certain people. I feel like only then, those people would actually care about me. I hate that I’m this way but I have to get it off my chest."
Sending love to all us BPD babes,340,fosqc6,35,"Hey, things are really weird and this pandemic is challenging in so many ways.

I'm sending you love right now. You may be stuck with family or friends or a partner that cause you to split often. You may be on your own and dealing with the challenges that come with that. No matter your situation, I hope you're coping the best that you can, that you have access to meds and online therapy if that's something you're able to get, and that you're not being too hard on yourself for hitting those difficult lows.

All the unknowns are hard to cope with, but we will get through this.

Sending you all my love.

edit: I'm feeling the love, and am so glad this message could help lift your day :') I'm so so grateful for this community "
DAE get EXTREMELY stressed to the point your literally screaming when you're running late and can't find something you need?,336,da11fg,55,I get so fucking worked up about it and it sucks cause I try and be logical and use DBT skills but bish I got 5 min to get out that door and can't find my pack of cigarettes or my phone or something else stupid af like that.. it's to the point where I will start crying and be completely ineffective.  gotta love BPD... 🙄
Why does our mood depend so much on other people?,343,bl1zzn,51,"It is always something I don't get. A FP doesn't respond? Our mood switches and it goes DOWN and we feel super insecure and shitty.  
A FP responds? It's all good, we can breath.  


Anxiety, panic, it's all connected with how other people react towards us, how they message us, how their tone is towards us.  


I think it's so unfair, others can just turn around and be egoistic, not feel anything when they just stop messaging us. This must be so easy. We sit there and stare at the phone / laptop and get nervous, anxious, basically our mood is in the hand of another person. And there's nothing we can do to turn it around, push a button so we breath out and it just goes away.

&#x200B;

Or does anyone have answers to that?

"BPD is like bipolar, but you trigger a manic episode every time you start to like someone, do something you're ambitious and/or passionate about, listen to the right music, or take on another identity.",345,90kp1r,43,
"DAE obsess in secret, not outwardly?",341,i6wix9,33,"Is anyone else super obsessive but only in private? I can easily become consumed by a person, especially someone I’m intimately involved with, but I stay very indifferent and detached superficially. This ofc is not how I actually feel - I stalk their socials, turn possessive, easily jealous and hurt by other people they interact with. Honestly, I tend to push people away by how discreet or cryptic I act on the surface, but inside I’m overwhelmed and so engulfed by thoughts of them. It’s evolves into a sick interest to know more about their lives and others in their circle, I know how fucked it is... it’s so scary to me"

I’m so sick of BPD being treated like a quirk, it’s ruined a lot of aspects of my life and I find it really hard to cope with, why do people act like it’s just some quirk? This obviously goes for all mental illnesses, but can people fucking not? It’s so frustrating and makes me feel like my mental health is being treated like a joke!"
DAE get really upset when things don’t go according to plan.,341,g37inw,47,"Like if someone says they’re going to do something and they don’t, or if you’ve made plans and they don’t happen.

Does anyone ever feel sad about the childhood they had and jealous of what other had and they didn't?,343,d2p0qp,45,"My parents fucked up, they didn't have money and weren't able to raise a kid but they still had me, sadly my mom was an alcoholic an my dad went to jail, so my mom remarried and my step-dad was a sick bastard, my family was always in debts and I was always so disgustingly jealous of all the kids from my school who didn't deserve the wealth they had access to cuz of their parents, seeing spoiled and entitled they are yet they had everything I could ever dream of having. Going to school was a nightmare, not having enough money to buy enough notebooks or get books for certain classes and having to put 3 different subjects in 1 notebook and have teacher yell at me or have kids fuck with me cuz they all knew what kind of family I came from and what kind of life I had and how funny that was to them.

I was always so jealous of all those kids born into families ready to give them everything, of all those girls with their moms teaching them things and going shopping and having their moms tell them what shampoo is best and what skin creme is good for them and what they should and shouldn't wear and sit in a cafe and be able to talk openly about boys and girly things or even deep things or philosophical questions and debate things or their moms teaching them what boys to stay away from and which boys are good and have those embarrassing talks about sex and what they should and shouldn't do, I never had a mom like that, a mom that wakes me up for breakfast or tells me to tie my hair cuz it's hot an I'll have pimples or tell me to wash my face multiple times throughout the day or to change clothes often an have her wash the dirty ones every 2-3 days or have a mom that would bring me fruit or ask me if I wanted a snack then bring me a sandwich or cookies or give me a monthly card to go to the pool an swim or go with her to buy a bikini or a bra for the 1st time an have those embarrassing moments... or have her teach me about eyebrows and make up and eyeliner and nails and how to to my hair or face masks or watch movies with me or help me decorate my room whn it's holidays or give me gifts when it's my birthday, hell even just congratulate me, praise me when I do well in something..  I never had a mom basically an God knows I'm fucking jealous of all the girls that had moms like this an took that for granted and were so shitty to them, I never had a dad either, to give me time limits and tell me what things to stay away from or a dad to take me hunting or tell me to do martial arts or teach me to handle a gun or teach me to fix things around the house, tell me he's proud of me or tell me mom is just a lil over the top cuz she cares an he'll talk to her about my punishment or have him be relaxed an chill an help me sneak out to hang out with my friends longer or have him order pizza and teach me about computers or just spoil me like most dads do with their daugthers, or have a boy over for the 1st time and have my dad look at him weirdly or my mom question him his name, his parents, where he lives, etc. hell I was never even able to invite anyone to my house cuz I lived in a rats lair rather than a house and I was so ashamed of that, so shitty going to school with 2 pants you change around and a couple shirts and that's it, having the same shoes for months and the same jacket for years or not even having them cuz they broke and you can't afford new ones, not having much food to eat cuz your mom is too busy drinking her life away to make any kind of food while others had a full damn fridge of food and kept complaining they don't know what to eat, not having a good phone cuz you can't afford it or not having computer or internet for some time cuz it's too expensive, while others had a gaming setup a laptop a tablet a phone a plazma tv too, being sick and not being able to afford meds, while others parents freak out when their kid gets sick and yours just tell you to get over it and shut up, but hey at least I had a roof over my head right, can't complain I guess..

DAE idealize people more when you are away from them and then think less of them when you are with them in person?,338,jg63g9,46,"It keeps happening. I go from feeling very strongly about someone and thinking everything about them is great when talking over text to feeling instantly like I'm not sure if I actually like them when we hang out in person. I feel most strongly about someone when I haven't seen them in a while. Yet I always want to see them.

It's definitely not just limited to relationships though. It's with anyone.

I don't know if this is a BPD thing or just my mind being weird."
I did not split and communicated in a healthy way after getting ghosted by a friend,337,h82rhx,17,"I texted a friend of mine if she wanted to hang out this week. No answer till Thursday. I got more and more anxious and angry about it. I had a dream about sending a passive aggressive text and getting back an arrogant hurtful answer. I thought this is not where I want this to go.

Instead I texted that it seems like she is busy. that i understand because she is moving soon. but that I´m not okay with her ignoring texts like that. i did not say anything to ""make her answer"" or ""make her apologize"" or to get a certain outcome. Just communicated that it made me uncomfortable and gave her the benefit of the doubt.

She answered in a longer voice memo, explaining how much is going on in her life but also acknowledging that she could and should have send a quick note. asked me how I was doing and that we could hang out once she is done moving.

I know i will get into situations like this again and I tend to obsess about this particular friend. I don´t have one FP but many people with the potential for me to put them on a pedestal. But I am glad I did something that helped ME get out of the discomfort decently and cope in a healthy way communicating my boundaries.

I listened to my dream guys! Because it showed me what would happen if I would keep showing down my anger and hurt till I can only react impulsively and hurt my friendship or myself by not saying anything."
Is it normal to feel “happy” and then something almost insignificant happens that makes you feel depressed and makes you have negative thoughts?,333,gnn0oc,39,"My bf just tells me something “wrong” I did and l feel like he rubs it on my face and like he’s attacking me and makes me shift my mood very quickly. I was alright, it just happened and I feel like sh*t.
I don’t really know what he wants, I don’t know if I am over reacting. I’m in a “stable” relationship with him, but a lot of times I just wish he disappeared you know? But I don’t want to be abandoned so it’s horrible. It feels like he’s playing with my feelings, but maybe I am the one who does that, so idk."
DAE feel bitter towards their parent(s) for permanently fucking them up?,339,cuwm1r,86,"I'd hate to go into the details of my childhood misery, but I've seen things no little child should see, I've endured so much physical, emotional & psychological abuse that it messed me up for good. I understand the physiological/predisposition aspects of mental illness,, but I can't help but feel angry towards my father for turning me into this total mess. I wonder how 'normal' I would've been without all the history and always place the blame on him for stripping that away from me.

Quiet BPD is hell,338,cbrzb6,63,They just don’t understand  how fucked up it is. Never see us act out and think it’s all good. Feeling hopeless.
Is it just me or DAE with BPD have extremely poor social skills?,338,jzy9rr,87,"I often think I may have aspergers but I’m not sure if it’s just my BPD. If I know someone well I’m super comfortable with them. However in the first I’d say 3 months of getting to know someone I’m extremely uncomfortable and awkward around them. It’s strange because people rarely ever make me feel uncomfortable, no matter how off the wall or awkward they are, but I constantly feel judged and like I have to make myself into what this person wants me to be. It’s why I get so awkward. I watch every single little word that comes out of my mouth, because if use one wrong word I think they’ll hate me and drop me in an instant. I think this leads to me having great trouble with making new friends or getting in relationships. People can read my lack of confidence through the way I talk. Do the rest of you all experience this or no?"
Do you feel as though your FP causes you more stress and anxiety than they cause you to feel happy?,335,jxwxnk,60,"My FP is my greatest source of joy, but he’s also my greatest source of anxiety, stress and sadness. More and more so, I feel like he causes me more stress and anxiety than anything else. 

Although I wanna talk to him and spend time together, I get a knot in my stomach when he texts, fearing it’s gonna be something bad like him changing his mind about the relationship. Or  I’ve managed to convince myself every time he’s texting he’s texting another girl, or every time we’re not together, I worry it’s because he’s trying to avoid me. Among many many other examples.

DAE feel as though their FP causes more stress and anxiety above almost everything else?"
"The incomprehensible feelings of wanting to stay away from everyone, but also feeling lonely and wanting someone's company",335,el63cb,18,"Recently I had a (few) bad episodes (breakdowns?) with various friends and I started lashing out at them. After that, I decided it probably was for the best for me to isolate myself for a while, because honestly, no one deserves to be on the end of me being an ass to them. And I could probably do without every little thing about them triggering me as well.   


But despite all that, it's been getting painfully hard to get through the days with no one to really *speak to.* Every now and then, I find myself grabbing my phone, considering just hopping back on social media, or some messaging app and reaching out to someone, anyone, but then stopping myself right before it by thinking about what'll happen if I do. My mind knows (thinks?) that I can't handle the company of others, but my heart (?) is so desperately craving it.  


I don't know which is the worse of the two at the moment, the emotional pitfall of company, or the emotional sinkhole of loneliness."
Chemical imbalances in BPD,335,efx4dh,87,"

I recently read a scholarly article about how people with BPD often have an imbalance of the neurotransmitter Glutamate in the brain, specifically an overabundance of Glutamate. This lead to a session of obsessive research. These were my finding:
 
Glutamate is a excitatory neurotransmitter and amino acid. It works synonymously with the neurotransmitter GABA. Glutamate causes our neurons to rapidly fire when presented with a trigger. This may be why people with BPD react so suddenly and impulsively. It is common for a BPD sufferer to have floods of Glutamate in the brain with a deficiency of GABA, the neurotransmitter that balances Glutamate and allows you to relax and ""shut off"" your brain. People with low GABA often experience anxiety, dread, negative thoughts, and rely on carbohydrates.
 
This lead me to research ways to naturally increase and balance GABA. One sure way is by consuming Omega-3 fatty acids. In earlier research I discovered that Omega-3's can help alleviate BPD symptoms. This may be because it aids in balancing GABA levels.
I'm posting this because I find the science and chemistry linked to BPD to be incredibly fascinating and I urge others to conduct research into this disease. We're not just ""crazy"" people. Our brains are completely different.
 
I have been taking Omega-3 for many weeks now and I believe it has greatly improved my ability to slow down before immediately reacting to an emotion.

"feel afraid to show physical affection because 1) it all feels vaguely sexual no matter what, (2) its vulnerability and thats scary, and (3) when it ends i feel empty again, so might as well not initiate it at all",338,axxwek,34,"i have the urge to hug people at times, but it feels weird because i think im deprived of sexual interaction (embarassing to say but felt it had to be addressed).   and i also am afraid of it for vague reasons that i think are what i said in the title.  i dont know, i end up avoiding reaching out because i dont want it to end, and im already used to being isolated and numb, so if i try to stop only to end up going back to numbness, it feels worse than just remaining as i am. but such is life i guess, and death is inevitable and now im having an existential breakdown so thats fun.

Just had an episode. Something triggered me and I got extremely angry. I locked myself in my room. I was so angry that I could've trashed my whole home.

oversharing,335,cz7fiz,59,"does anyone else overshare too often? it seems like every day i find someone and i decide i can trust them, even after 2 minutes of talking. i then tell them so much information, usually information i'm not supposed to talk about. i know it's a horrible trait to have, but it feels like i can't control it. it usually comes back and bites me in the ass, and makes me lose people. how do you deal with it? i've heard keeping a diary helps, and i'm hoping that paired with starting back at therapy makes the urge to talk to everyone about everything less often."
I finally understand that this is not normal.,334,cp16qv,22,"I always thought extreme mood swings were normal. I thought that hating yourself to the point you cant even look at yourself was normal.
I thought reacting extremely strongly emotionally was nothing out of the ordinary. 
I thought everybody had abandonment issues.
I always wondered why do I feel so empty all the time.
Many times Ive felt like I got no hope.
Ive always wondered why people end up abandoning me even though I loved them.

I feel a bit relieved to know that these things arent normal, at all. But at the same time I never knew how fucked I really am."
Starvation,338,hsbyg7,50,"Accidentally skip a few meals and then don't want to really get back to eating properly because you secretly enjoy the feeling of starving?

I've had an eating disorder in the past but I'm not craving to be skinny anymore. I just sometimes secretly love this pain or whatever. Wonder if this is some masochistic behaviour..."
Anyone else also feel like they’re faking their disorder sometimes?,337,hi3ede,41,"From time to time, I will start thinking that my entire fibre of being is fake. I feel like I don’t actually have any mental illnesses, regardless of what I’m diagnosed with. This is especially true with BPD. It feels like I’m self-invalidating my pain because I see people who live normally without this disorder. I psyche myself into feeling like I don’t even deserve pain and I’m just faking everything. Surprise surprise, I’m not, but I feel like this sometimes. A lot of it also has to revolve around the stigma towards *men* with BPD. Reading about how uncommon it is has gotten me into dangerous loops of self doubt, loathing, and invalidation, breaking apart any small amount of progress I made that day. 

It causes my progression to take a few steps back because I can’t accept the fact that I could possibly be feeling this. This is also especially true when I’m happy. If I’m happy, then why am I diagnosed with multiple depression-inducing disorders? It’s like I can’t even be happy without feeling fake. It can be really aggravating.

I can’t be the only one. I’d love to hear an outside perspective as I have no one to confide in regarding BPD aside from myself and my peers who don’t have the disorder. Anyway, I love you all, stay safe 💖"

I want to scratch and feel the burns of my scratches all over my body I want to hit things, hit someone, or myself, I want to yell and scream, I even get images of myself in my head thrashing around and screaming and it scares the shit out of me. Especially when those feelings make me feel like I’m going to hurt someone else. I feel horrible. I feel like that right now and I’m just laying in bed trying to get it to go away. Just laying here scratching at my arms (not to hard, or at least trying) and just going out of my mind. As far as I remember I haven’t really acted out on these feelings, except just staying quiet and being irritable except one time I was drinking (yeah bpd and alcohol is a no go) and my boyfriend was driving and I just reached over and pulled the steering wheel to the side. Luckily he was able to grab it and nothing happened but I know I probably Scared the shit out of him and I’m surprised he didn’t leave me. I just want to cry but I can’t idk what to do I hate this so much."
Self aware =\= being able to control a situation,332,aon97u,34,"I realised that being self aware and understanding your bpd makes it 10x worse because you figure out WHY you’re acting how you act and what can potentially make you stop but .... can you REALLY stop?

Being bored every single day is excruciating,331,kuodmp,68,"I’m currently being assessed for BPD in therapy, and I really need some answers soon. Every single day is a chore. I’m basically just watching the clock and waiting for bed time to come so I can smoke weed and knock myself out. It feels like there’s nothing in this world I could be interested in and stick to. I’ve tried starting so many hobbies, but I always end up giving up and sulking in bed. I’m currently on antipsychotics for Bipolar I and SSRIS for GAD, and my mood is somewhat stable compared to before. However, every day feels so boring with some random happy days in between. Yesterday, I went shopping and it made me so happy that I became very impulsive. I ended up agreeing to hook up with a random guy and now I regret it. Wtf is wrong with my brain? When I’m not immediately happy, I just feel completely empty and bored. I really really hope I can get some answers soon. This emptiness and boredom has been part of my life for so long I don’t even know what it’s like to feel like a fulfilled person with interests and real personality traits. Ugh."

DAE find nothing fun and do nothing as a result?,338,gu0sf3,51,"I have hobbies but I mostly stay at home. I really only go out to take care of mandatory responsibilities. I go on drives to nowhere where I do nothing and go home again. I'm kind of baffled by the things my friends find fun.

It all seems like too much effort. I dont really know how to even think of something fun to do. When I try to think of something I can do to be entertained I end up watching YouTube at home to avoid thinking.

My Google search history periodically has ""what do people do for fun,"" or some phrase similar to it.

two people canceled on our plans within an hour and I didn't freak out!,331,ihaopj,23,"23f here, and I had plans tonight for dinner with friend 1. I got to the restaurant and as I sat down, I got a text from him saying his bike tire popped and asking if we could reschedule to next week.

I text friend 2, who ends up never replying.

ok, no problem, I'm sure he's just busy (even tho his instagram showed he was online, I managed to convince myself he genuinely isn't ignoring me and is probably just doing something). turns out friend 2 was biking all night and didn't see my message - glad I didn't spiral and get angry at him for a reason my dumb brain invented.

so, I'm sitting alone at the restaurant, and I text my bf to see when he'll be done getting his tattoo, and he says he could be there within the hour. no problem, I'll wait.

hour comes and goes, and my bf tells me it's taking longer than expected and that I could either keep waiting at the restaurant, or I could meet him at home. I feel a pang of sadness, and tell him no problem, I'll meet you at home. 

not once did I get angry, spiral, cry, panic, or send mean messages to people who upset me. I felt the sadness and disappointment, I didn't shove it down, but I also didn't lean into it, and I didn't let it ruin my night.

1 year of CBT and DBT seem to have really paid off, especially when it comes to emotional regulation and dealing with anger, disappointment, and rejection issues. there is a light at the end of the tunnel you guys, and it looks like being a semi normal human who doesn't freak out on her friends at the slightest issue.

DAE play YouTube videos in the background so they don’t feel so alone?,327,bdack7,53,"When I’m alone at home doing homework or chores around the house, I always have YouTube videos or podcasts playing in the background because it makes me feel less lonely.

Does anyone else experience splitting with interests / passions / hobbies?,334,mcj6zc,61,"I have experienced splitting with all of my romantic partners but I've just noticed that:

Some days I will be so incredibly committed and into a passion, hobby, interest... I will be fully dedicated 100%, spending the entire day researching and working on a project or practicing a skill... and then from one day to the next I will virtually ***not care about it at all*** and feel completely hollow and empty, passionless and aimless, directionless. As if I was never even interested in it. 

Just sitting in that state right now when the past few days I was in heated passion mode. Very disorienting."

Ever wonder if it's your BPD or if it's your partner?,331,e56jcs,67,"The thing I hate the most about BPD, is trying to figure out if it's my BPD making me think negative things about my husband. Or if he is actually an untrustworthy, lying POS. It's awful even saying that out loud, but I honestly can't figure it out half the time. He does nice things for me, so it doesn't make sense that he would be lying to me or have a hidden agenda, but my BPD won't let me shake it off that he isn't out to screw me over. Anyone else experience this? If so, how do you cope with it?"
Does anyone else avoid making friends or new relationships because they know they'll fuck them up or self destruct?,330,dlqm2x,30,Every time I form a new relationship with someone or make a new friend I get clingy and posessive and then end up acting out at the person and scaring them away.. It fucks everything up. So I've kind of just avoided making any relationships at this point. It always ends the same way anyway.
Is anyone else literally smitten by their pet?,331,ctgwti,120,"I have this chubby, talkative, drooly, dopey smush of a cat. I’m OBSESSED with him and I think it’s justified. For example, when the front doorbell rings, he runs downstairs and rubs on whoever it is until they pet him. POLICE INCLUDED. He needs attention the same way I do (!!!!) and makes it very obvious. My family found him in someone’s lawn when he was no more than a week old and we nursed him back to health with the idea of adopting him out but.......we just couldn’t. 

All he knows are his humans—that’s probably why he’s so nice, but I don’t think being this level of sensitivity and friendliness is something that can be “taught.” He never leaves my side! He loves everything I do!!! It couldn’t be more clear that he knows when I’m sad and needs to drool and purr on me. He makes me so happy and is such a wonderful cat that I don’t even feel weird for being so grateful for him and loving him so much. Boyfriend’s a bit jealous tbh 😂 Does anyone else have an amazing ESA? Tell me!!!

TL;DR I’m really grateful for my 6 y/o cat. His name is Sarge. He thinks he’s tough (HE ISN’T). And, as is true with all white cats, he’s got an enormous pink belly underneath all the fur."
I wish the people in my life who knows I have BPD would research more into it to understand where I’m coming from.,336,bktzsz,40,"Just gotta start off by saying that being someone who’s extremely aware of their BPD and OCD is fucking difficult. 

It’s so frustrating talking to people close to me... is it selfish for me to want someone to understand my disorder(s) by simply reading a source that describes why I am the way I am currently? My mom just tells me I’ve had mood swings my whole life and doesn’t understand how severe they’ve gotten over the years. People close to me tell me to get out and do things to “take my mind off” of what’s currently going on in my mind, but they don’t realize how hard it is for me to get the courage to do something. Or how my PTSD fucks up my way of thinking 10 times more.. Tasks that seem so simple to others without BPD are my absolute nightmare.

When I drive I dissociate pretty much the whole time and I have to tell myself that I’m driving so I don’t wreck my car; I vented to my mom about this and thinks I’m suicidal (like lmao guuurl you’re in for a rude awakening when I’m actually suicidal). 

If you’ve gotten to this point in my post then be prepared to read some ranting, hey maybe you could relate though— 

I’m so aware of my BPD and I know exactly what I need to do to better my life, but instead I hang onto my shit habits. I also won’t let go of someone who doesn’t understand my thought process and is too immature to understand that one small thing he says can make me go into a severe depressive state mixed with hella anxiety. One small thing leads up to me overthinking about said small thing, then I express how I feel to this person, and then feel guilty an hour or so afterwards because I had a mood swing that I couldn’t control and now I’ve fucked things up more. It doesn’t help though that he gaslights me, lies about very important shit, has me blocked off social media but gives other girls attention, and doesn’t listen to anything I say if he doesn’t want to hear it. He tells me that I ruin his day anytime I say something negative, aka something he doesn’t like which is most of the time shit he needs to hear. I mean maybe he’s telling me the truth sometimes and I overthink it; but my gut thinks otherwise most of the time and I feel like I can’t let myself be so naive since he’s fucked me over in the past. It fucks with me hard because I feel like my feelings are valid and most of the time this person just invalidates them and talks about leaving me because my emotions “tire” him. I understand where he’s coming from and I tell him that he’s not obligated to stay with me because I know I suck, but he won’t let go. Our relationship is turning into a record that’s becoming more and more broken overtime. He doesn’t take the time to research and understand my way of thinking through BPD, but thinking of him finding someone who isn’t fucked up like me just wrecks me. I’ll forever think that I was the one who fucked this relationship up by pushing him away by accident because of my mood swings/insecurities. 

I know this person isn’t good for me and I’m not good for him, especially if I want to heal because he doesn’t understand me enough.. my fear of abandonment makes me unable to leave or let him go (it’s been a 5 year long relationship). All my (very few) relationships with everyone in my life would be so much easier for themselves and me if they would just fucking take 5 minutes out of their day to understand how people with BPD think and act. I want new people in my life but I don’t want to meet these people, I don’t want these people to see me as a monster because I have scars on my body and am emotionally unstable. 

I feel comfortable with being uncomfortable with how my life is going and people just view it like I’m wanting to torture myself because I don’t want to try and it’s such an “easy fix”. 
When someone tries to make plans with me my mind is always like— “no, I don’t want to have dinner with you because I’ll look like I’m fucking crazy to you with my erratic conversations and you’ll probably tell me at some point that all I have to do is simply get out of bed to better my life.” Like yo.. if I had any energy to better my life I fucking would.. if only you knew what goes though my mind. I only agreed with you to get dinner because I was in a happy mood, but just wait.. I’ll definitely bail on you soon so I don’t have to bother you with my trauma."
Anybody else fantasize about the act of running away?,331,aqtbeu,53,"I spend a lot of my time at night dreaming up starting over somewhere else. Living alone and maintaining a hermit existence.

DAE purposely avoid their FP to wait for them to start a conversation?,330,kmuntu,47,"There will be times where I intentionally don’t message or talk to my FP for a while because I’m waiting for them to start a conversation, instead of mostly myself all the time. It’s sort of like a game, albeit maybe a stupid one. But it’s for me to determine how long it will take for them to reach out to me instead of the other way around. It’s kind of my way of determining how much they actually care about me. At the same time this game almost always ends in me caving and reaching out to them since they haven’t reached out to me. 😞"
A message about FP’s,329,gpbmx4,110,"I’ve noticed that a lot of people on this subreddit use the term “FP”. I was not familiar, so I looked it up. Apparently its origins are Tumblr related, and so it was an entirely internet-made term (not diagnostic). 

Sometimes in mental health communities, we can normalize or validate behavior that is not founded. I feel like this is the case with the term FP. I personally have had past relationships that would fall under the “FP” umbrella, but the term is misleading slightly and also not a requirement for the diagnosis, more-so a pitfall. A more concrete word for this term in my mind would be a codependent relationship.

I am not speaking about a healthy support network or a healthy relationship (which is possible with a BPD diagnosis). Codependent relationships feature obsession in which one person relies on the other fully for validation and emotion regulation. This type of relationship is toxic and tiresome for all parties. It is not a fair expectation and can lead to extreme feelings of abandonment when that person ultimately can’t be there every second of every hour to make things better. It’s an unhealthy expectation and not a true stable relationship. 

This was an important thing for me to realize so that I could start to enjoy long-term friendships/relationships. I’ve realized taking accountability in relationships is essential and I’ve gained the self awareness to focus getting validation inwards. Focusing on meeting my own emotional needs has been extremely refreshing and has eased the burdens in my interpersonal relationships. It’s also the only way I’ve seen true progress with my BPD and overall self-worth. It may be cheesy, but lasting validation does really come from within and it has allowed the rest of my life to blossom. 

While we shouldn’t be ashamed of having an “FP”, we shouldn’t be complacent in its existence or rationalize this relationship as acceptable. I know it is a hard thing to accept sometimes, but codependent relationships are toxic and they aren’t “normal” for borderlines. It’s a negative relationship to which we are predisposed, but we are not trapped in. 

This post is not meant to be negative or hurt anyone’s feelings in any way. I know it is likely an unpopular opinion and I’ll receive some negative feedback, but I just wanted to bring some awareness to this topic for possible growth. 

I hope everyone is doing well <3"
DAE feel the (quiet) rejection incoming and want to just rather block/ghost them than being rejected/not feeling good enough?,325,gktze3,34," 

I'm sure the scenario of them not reciprocating is just all in my head.. but it makes me terrified to the point I'll self sabotage. Its crippling where feeling the fear of abandonment and rejection and the pain it brings outweighs the possibility of being happy dating someone I actually care about.

I(30M) end up in short flings with women, friends say I have a pattern of subconsciously choosing woman I don't see a future with. Trying to see how I can overcome my fear and not avoid the ones I actually care for."
"DAE feel like their mind ""turns over"" every few months?",330,bf3w6n,53,"I've had this experience since I was probably 12 years old... I'll become super immersed in something, be it a hobby, a topic of interest, a video game, writing, drawing, yoga, martial arts, whatever it is. This can go on for three months to a year where I really build my identity around this thing... and then one day, like literally, I wake up and it's like someone wiped my memory. I just don't think about the thing I was obsessed with anymore. It's not gradual either. I literally wake up one day with zero interest. Sometimes I'm conscious of it, but other times I'll just forget I ever cared about it from one day to the next. It won't even occur to me to think about it anymore. Other times when I *am* conscious of losing interest, even if I don't want to, I can't help it. My brain just stops caring. It's SO frustrating...

**Edit: As frustrating as this is for all of us it makes me feel a little better knowing I'm not alone in the experience!**"
"for the first time in my life, I turned down a relationship/friendship, because I am worthy of relationships/friendships that make me feel GOOD!",333,l9g23x,13,"I have BPD and PTSD and one of my eternal struggles is friendships. If I have friends, they are always awful. I never notice that at the time, but it's true.

i/e, I have had friendships where it's clear in hindsight that the friend was trying to get me to have sex with them, that same friend was very generous with alcohol. I've had friendships where this friend was very kind and caring to me when she was taking advantage of my people pleasing nature to help her move or take her out to eat when she doesn't have money, and otherwise would not invite me out or even initiate contact with me. Mostly I'm not friends with men at all because I can't read them. I'm always always wrong about their intentions.

It's pathetic and gross but all my life I've been eaten up by this chronic loneliness, and I take what I can get. I think people can smell that I'm sick. It's uncanny. Over the last year I stopped giving myself away like I was. I stopped being friends with people who suck my life force, or who I don't trust. It worked in that I don't have these shitty people around me, but also it worked in that I now have no friends. This year, I'm still lonely.

So when an old coworker of mine, John, recently reached out to me on social media. He sent me some songs. I sent some back. Eventually I gave him my number because the conversations were friendly and I didn't have any bad feelings. After a bit of talking I noticed:

1. John was very gatekeep-y. He sent me like the same 6 songs that were all Nirvana/Pearl Jam/other 90s band. I don't think he listened to the songs I sent him at all. And he was really intent on grilling me to see if I was a ""true punk"" who listened to these ""real bands"".
2. John randomly had a friend whose boyfriend hit her, so he went over there to fight the boyfriend. I thought this was very dramatic and personal so I was like ???? why are you sharing this with me. He said things like ""why do they always stay with their abusers"" and stuff. It was weird.
3. John randomly revealed that his ex was stalking him and that made him very angry. I've been stalked before, angry isn't exactly the feeling I had. But to each their own!
4. John started to try to get me to be his therapist. He sent me a longwinded text about his deep seated childhood trauma, that he had never told anyone before apparently. I told him his parents were assholes. He got mad at me for calling his parents assholes? I'm not a therapist, though. A therapist is the person you can tell deep trauma to and they won't use the word asshole. That's not me.
5. John kept prying. He even asked my diagnosis (that's a no). He asked me questions like ""What's the worst thing that ever happened to you?"" ""Tell me a secret."" ""What's the hardest thing you ever done?"" ""Who do you hate?"" etc etc. He clearly wanted me to spill my guts to him. I don't know if it was to make him feel better about spilling his guts to me? But I don't do that type of shit. I have learned my lesson from meeting creeps and people who want to throw things back in my face if I make them mad later.
6. John started to violate my boundaries. He'd slip in a babe or a beautiful, and each time I'd tell him to stop. He would do it again anyway.
7. John started to criticize how I talk! Said that ""He understands that I'm not interested, if I would stop rubbing it in by calling him dude/buddy/pal."" That's just how I talk to my dudes and buddies and pals. IDK!
8. some other big red flags but let's not roast John any more because I feel bad

After noticing these things within like 3 days of talking, I stopped talking to him. John is the type of man who says he wants to be friends, but secretly hates me for only being friends with him. He asked me to hang out and I didn't respond. I felt that he was untrustworthy and shady, and not the type of person I want to be friends with, perhaps even someone who could be dangerous. Old me would have jumped into the woodchipper that is John, feet first. Today he texted me the lyrics to Creep by Radiohead. New me didn't respond.

This person clearly wants me to think they're brave and unique (maybe making up stories and lying to seem that way) and also wants me to never tell them no and also wants me to be their therapist. Red flag city! Today, I said no!!! A year ago, I would have said ""be there in 5""!

Recovery is happening and it doesn't look like what I thought it would, and it definitely doesn't feel as good as I thought it would. Because I'm still lonely and a part of me knows I can let this person use me and in turn I would feel loved and validated temporarily and I would not feel so lonely for a moment. I'm not going to, because I deserve better. GROSS!! AND YAY!"
My fucking cousin killed my cat,334,i16066,88,"We adopted an adorable white kitten a while ago. I was going through a very difficult time of my life, and she was my only support. She never trusted anyone else, not my brother or my mom but she would always sit on my lap, ask for hugs and her presence comforted me so much.  Turns out my brother is allergic to cats, we had to give her. And my mom has the bright idea to give her to my aunt. 

My aunt's kid is probably the most evil, mean spirited and disturbing kid I've ever seen in my entire life. I know I shouldn't hate on a 8 years old but she's horrible, she does and says stuff that just makes me want to puke. 
And so recently I learned that my aunt found my cat, dead in the middle of their parking lot. They live on 3rd floor. That's right, my cousin fucking did that, she threw my cat out of the fucking window, a few months old adorable ball of love and she killed her just like that. And no one said anything. 

I hate that kid, she took the one thing that helped me deal with my joke of a life, and I can't, everytime I see her I get so mad it's so unfair I want to cry I want my cat back everyone let me down, I'm blaming my brother my mom and that little shit I still can't believe it happened

Edit : I'm seeing a lot of comments of people proudly saying that  they'd beat her up, what in the grand fuck ? She's 8 and as mentionned in this thread she is going through enough abuse. I understand the intentions behind those commments but they do not help at all. Also if you're gonna argue wether or not hating on a kid is ok ? Have your fun but don't invalidate my feelings and don't expect an answer from me. I wanna thank the rest of you guys for all the support, awards and kind words, today was complicated for me and I can't thank you enough for the nice comments that made it easier."
"""This sub is a circle jerk of...""",329,gh34od,45,"I see a lot of posts forgiving or sympathizing with a number of symptoms of BPD or life in general. I've also started seeing a lot more posts annoyed about the sympathetic posts. I find the second more unhelpful than the first, in most cases.

We're a group of people with a personality disorder that ruins perspective and makes us feel inherently abnormal. We are all in different stages of learning to cope, even if that stage is vehement denial or learned helplessness. 

Yes, some people will over identify with their disorder, but that might be what they need to do in this moment. There was most likely a point at which we all needed to do so. We change frequently and those stages pass but they are necessary.

There is a process of mourning what you thought could be easily fixable, no more than needing to adapt, only to find out that the problems are very likely coming from an inability to adapt that became a full personality.

We deal with too much shit to give more to each other. None of us have the same experience or even the same disorder. None of us have the exact same comorbid disorders. It presents differently in every single person. There will be masses of us who need to hear something or another to show them they are, even in their abnormalities, still normal. Even if what one person needs to hear is not what you need to hear or something you've heard too many times.

Life is hard. BPD is hard. Learning healthy coping skills long after you've internalized unhealthy ones is harder still. We are different but we congregate here because we are generally the same in this one thing: we want to grow.

Let's be kind to each other, moreso now than ever before, considering the state of the world.

EDIT: this got a little overwhelming but I see a ton of great things I want to respond to, it might just take me awhile! Thanks so much for all the support and constructive comments."

Some Positives About BPD,329,d1pim5,87,"When I was diagnosed with BPD and the psychologist at the hospital was explaining everything to me, I was in despair. I thought that was the worst thing I could be possibly diagnosed with. But in the months that have passed I’ve given this some thought...

Our emotions are more intense, so nobody knows happiness like we do. Most people only get so happy to the point of tears a couple times in their life, I can’t count on my hands the amount of times I have! There’s something poetic about being over the moon over seemingly simple things (like getting off work early)!

We love so much harder and in my opinion... so much better! Our partners, past present and future will never ever feel as loved as they will when they’re with us. When my boyfriend tells me really simple silly stories I’m all ears. He’s a car guy so of course I do my research on cars to try to understand him and talk with him about it. I read the entirety of Homestuck for my ex gf (which is thousands of pages long and took me months)! We care about the smallest things they do. It’s intense but it’s pure! And soo euphoric! Healthy BPD love is the BEST love! 

Those of us who feel as if they have control over the negative aspects of BPD are always so happy to help our brothers and sisters. When I got diagnosed my friend with BPD was a huge help. I owe so much to her because of it, it’s just so much more helpful when the advice is coming from someone who genuinely gets it.

That’s all I can think of right now, but please add some more positives! Let’s remind ourselves that BPD isn’t all bad :) <3

Edit: Thanks for all the additions! I’m so happy this is resonating with everyone! I kept seeing really sad posts and I just wanted to remind people that BPD isn’t a curse, it’s who we are and it can be super great to be us! Keep being rad guys!!"

I think that is complete bullshit. I come here to vent, to express myself in ways that I would not in real life and say things that I keep bottled up. I come here because I know everyone understands how I feel, and in real life that is not easy to come by. and I get support here all the time. If you really truly believe that this is a place where we come to just “feel bad” about ourselves and/or seek validation, maybe you should unsubscribe because that’s definitely not needed in this sub. We’re a support group for each other and negativity like that is unnecessary."
"Anyone else get ""action urges""?",326,a4gyoh,44,"I suddenly feel intensely restless and yearning for something, and I have this sinking feeling in my stomach like I need to desperately do something to appease it. Lately I've been feeling like I need to get in my car and get the fuck out of my state.

I’m doing better,330,laqj9h,31,"I cut out all social media. That means snap, insta, and Facebook. I’m not comparing myself to anyone. Not scrolling thru photos wishing I looked this way.

I’m also trying to find a primary doctor to help me with my bpd and issues with my past.
Edit: guys thank you so so so much for the positive comments! It means so much to me!!!! And yes most of you who are considering cutting social media out do it. It helps so much especially when you have bpd. It takes away some stress and obligation of comparing yourself to others. Plus you’ll have time to do all the hobbies you want or even if you planned of working out you’ll have time for that instead of scrolling thru social media. Thank you!

I fixed a stool I found by the dumpster instead of hurting myself,327,grqszw,24,"Not exactly BPD centered, but I need to tell someone and this place feels right.


So... I vent to my psychiatrist for the first time in really long time this morning. It went well, he congratulated me on passing my second year of no self harm.

After that I had VERY bad day. Like.. panic attack at work two hours after leaving the psych, having to leave early and boss not being happy about it, seeking help and support from friend and getting the worst fucking treatment.

So when I was on my way home, eyes red and puffy from crying and all that jazz, the well known feeling of nothingness appeared. And the blissful image of cutting my ribcage and thighs open with it. It was so calming that I without hesitation decided to just get home,get a knife and make myself bleed. It made me stop crying.

I passed the dumpster next to our building, hands itching for some pain. And I saw small wooden ikea stool. The folding type. And since im broke and need something to put under my plant, it caught my eye. I noticed it was broken - the wood keeping the stool from folding back when you put it together was chipped off. 

Suddenly all the soothing thoughts of selfharm were gone and all I could think of was ""okay, im can fix this stool"".

So I took it with me, pulled out the tool box I've never used in my life so far,made some mess, used fucking hand saw without even thinking of using it on myself, and fixed it. 

Does it look nice? No. Will it eventually fall apart and need better fix? Definitely. 

But all selfharm thoughts are gone. I somehow feel like I don't want to die in sleep tonight.

So I guess... go dumpster diving when you feel like hurting yourself lol."
"The more functional I get, the less human I feel.",325,f7dula,74,"I'm so much more functional now, and I don't breakdown as much. I assumed that meant I was doing much better, but after speaking to my therapist I realised I'm doing so much worse. What I thought was 'acceptance' of like how life is in reality me giving up and feeling completely hopeless and just kind of numb. That helps me from being a mess, but deep down I feel numb and aimless and I can't even cry because I feel like I don't deserve to cry. I used to be so so so ambitious, topper who was always eager to accomplish a lot - slowly it faded away. For the longest amount of time, I would cry etc. because things weren't working out the way I aspired them to. Now, I don't cry because I can't care anymore. Whatever. I learnt it was because I had been let down by people and hurt and just have had so many bad incidents that I have completely shut down to avoid the pain. I never reach out, I expect nothing from life or people around me. My therapist said I can't even be vulnerable with myself. But I don't want to. I can't see a point to it. Everyone leaves me and I constantly fuck up my relationships. I want to feel hope and I want to want to fall in love etc. Bu now I am such a level of hopeless that even when I try to feel hope my brain just knows nothing is going to happen, no one will save me, nothing good is going to ever happen to me, I just keep going. So I do keep going. I function. But I feel nothing. And I feel so tired and just bleh. I want close relationships and llove so badly, but I choose not to be vulnerable because I know for a fact that people (at least the ones around me) will genuinely betray me or not care. And I'm fine with that, But I just. IDK Please help me out here. Idk what to do, I want to feel but i also don't.

EDIT: since so many of us feel this, i think i will ask my therapist about it and share my learnings and tips"
Continuously deleting and rewriting your messages only to respond with emojis because you feel like you keep fucking their day up each time you talk to them because life throws one disgusting vomit sludge ball after another and you can tell your horrible life is bringing everyone down: a mood.,330,d319km,22,"And it always happens when they're having something great happen to them.
And said person is your FP."
The state of the world is terrifying to me and it's making my BPD worse,326,iw2yze,44,"I'm not trying to get political here or anything, this is about climate change and the pandemic, but you're more than welcome to disagree with what I'm saying it's just how I feel and I wonder if anyone else can relate.

I'm terrified. I'm terrified of global warming. I'm terrified of the current pandemic. I'm terrified of the future anyway, but with everything happening... I'm even more scared. The world is literally burning. Species are dying off at an alarming rate. People I've known have died of Covid. And I personally believe that the two of these things are connected. 

It just feels so damn hopeless. I can't honestly see how things will change for the better. We just seem to be going down this steep descent and it seems as though the powers that be are doing the bare minimum to fix it, if anything at all. I do my best to live as environmentally friendly as possible, but I still feel like I can't do enough. 

I can't focus on a future for myself and when I try I just feel this incredible sense of terror. I know there isn't really anything anyone can say to quell my concerns, because everything is so up in the air and none of us truly know what the future holds... But I just can't see good things coming, on a personal and global level. 

It just makes the prospect of healing and dealing with BPD and anxiety seem extra impossible... Like what's the point in sticking around to just watch things fall apart even more? 

I guess I just wondered if anyone else shares these feelings.."
"I want someone to talk to, but I also do not want to talk to anyone.",328,f34dnt,21,"I just feel so alone. All the time. 

I hold back from talking to anyone when I’m upset. Sometimes I can be upset in a normal way and in that situation I will speak of it, otherwise I find it better to keep it to myself. 
I am more than aware of how unhealthy and extreme I can be in a situation that upsets me too much, and so because of that, I am able to recognize when to remove myself in one way or another. 
It genuinely upsets people to hear how I feel and what it makes me think, so at all costs, I try to prevent myself from oversharing. My father and sister mean more to me than any other family, I know that they would never judge me about anything. When I share with them I swear I can hear the weight crush them. 
My boyfriend always lets me speak without judgement but because he happens to be non reactionary and non inquisitive and non interested, it seems pointless. It’s similar to saying something just to hear yourself say it. 

I have friends and none of them are an FP. I have healthy and normal relationships with all 4 of them. I don’t know if the Long Distance aspect has anything to do with that. I can control when we interact verbally or personally so I never have to speak about anything crazy deep. 

I try to fit my life into my “good days” and hide on the bad ones. When I’m happy, I don’t need anyone though, I prefer my own company.  When I’m having a bad day, I need someone to understand me but I know it would be difficult to achieve that so I don’t want anyone. 

I just don’t even. What am I supposed to do? I cannot imagine a version of my life where I don’t feel isolated, by choice or otherwise.

Post script:

I really appreciate all the feedback and comments. It is honestly super great to feel understood so easily, without having to justify anything. Thanks er’body."
Anyone else see people enjoying their lives and get really sad?,326,dgxcgo,36,"I was with my family at the beach and I don't really like them so I was just miserable on my phone. Saw someone and their girlfriend giggling a few feet away from me and felt like the biggest loser ever.

I'm pretty young, but it hurts. Especially as a  guy, I'm supposed to make the first advance, which makes meeting people extra difficult."
angryyy,322,m69ckd,54,"anyone else just get random bursts of extreme anger n literally just want to rip their fuckin skin off? like i literally get so so angry over ANYTHING and then i get intrusive thoughts of literally bashing my skull off of shit, it’s even worse because my dad passed down his anger issues to me so that with bpd is so bloody intense. dead ass just wanna rip my eyes out ughhhh"
Does anyone else’s symptoms seem to come in cycles?,328,m45k1x,56,"So obviously the symptoms of BPD that I present with are generally always there, but sometimes i feel they’re under control and I can brush them off and recognise when I’m being crazy - but other times they become unmanageable. 

It seems to cycle. I might be okay for a week or two, maybe three. During this time I’m still emotionally sensitive as a person in general, but don’t often get ‘stuck’ on things, and can brush off negative feelings for the most part. I feel happy throughout the day and have motivation to do things I like. I feel hopeful for the future and excited to make plans for my life and start new projects and things like that. 

Then all of a sudden I’ll go into this phase of feeling HURT by everything. Constantly crying. Every minor inconvenience makes me angry or sad or gives me some kind of strong emotional reaction. I can’t speak to people for very long without getting irritable and I become disinterested in engaging with other people. I’ll find myself stuck in my head a lot, a constant stream of negative or anxiety provoking thoughts. I can’t enjoy anything because I cant stop worrying for feeling distressed to some degree. I get paranoid about people leaving, paranoid about their intentions, whether they even like me and split on people a lot. I also get the urge to sabotage good things, like ruin relationships or not engage with therapy or stop doing my hobbies. I also fantasise about suicide a lot, I think mostly as a way to escape these feelings rather than to actually die. But in the moment I’m convinced I want to be dead. This cycle also usually lasts 1-2 weeks, but will feel really intense. I might have a couple of okay days within that period, but it’s mostly a constant flow of really overwhelming and exhausting emotions. 

Is this how BPD is for most people? Or is it usually more constant. I feel really frustrated because just when I think I’m feeling happy and more stable, I can’t seem to hold on to it and slip back into the whole groove of BPD again."
just got out of the psych ward,328,ky7cl4,50,"never going back. hurts. made me be vulnerable about my feelings and punished me for not being happy and positive 24/7. the meds make me feel like i'm trapped in my head. can't talk, can't express myself. hurts. being alive hurts. what's the point.  i feel stupid. talked to me like i was a child, like i was mentally challenged. it's not delusional or paranoid if i'm actually being judged for everything i do. i hate these meds. i hate feeling like this. my mood swings are still extreme, i just can't articulate my feelings. i still wanna die, i'm just so tired. they didn't listen. feels like no one listens. no one sees me. no one understands. stuck and sad and stupid and small. why didn't they understand?"
Pettiness,324,jb8feg,66,"Does anyone else get extremely petty when someone is mean to you or hurts you in some way? No matter how hard I try to break this seemingly never ending cycle, nothing every seems to stop it.  Whenever I get hurt or mad all I can think about is getting back at them and doing the same thing so they know how I feel... for example if they leave me on read and ignore me I’ll do it for longer and it has gotten as bad as me cheating to get back at my ex that cheated on me first.  

It’s so toxic and I hate that I’m like this, I simply want to be able to forgive and forget instead of always trying to get back at the person.  I feel like I’m not going to be able to keep any meaningful relationships because I’m just going to sabotage them all like a child with my pettiness.  Has anyone gone through this and if so what are some things that helped it/made you stop being petty."
Is there a reason why we constantly think of scenarios where we are abandoned?,326,fj1v3p,40,"I know this is common for everyone here with borderline but isn't it strange that we try to look at absolutely everything as evidence we are being abandoned even when we clearly are not and know we are loved.  


My GF ran into a small shop infront of me once to grab a drink and said she would only be a minute but as she took longer I freaked out thinking she decided to jump out of a window in the shop to run away, stuff like this is irrational.  
I guess you get so used to everyone in your life tossing you to the side you see anything as proof it is happening again.  


I do try my best not to let any of this show"
"DAE form relationships (friendship etc) out of desperateness, but then regret the people and back out?",327,evoj6z,41,"So frequently I.... get so hungry for connection that I befriend people that actually do not fit me. Then I wakr up one day and have to get rid of everyone as no one looks familiar or feels safe. I ended up ""befriending"" and fucking this guy who I have ZERO attraction to and had to sort of fess up last night. He wants to be friends with me tho and idk how to say that I dont want that either, I want you to go away because you remind me of denial and we dont have as much in common as u think because I faked most of it. Not on purpose but because I needed someone.
Its just like.... im so exhausted. Literally there are four people right now who I want nothing to do with. Including a ""friend"" in chicago who I feel no closeness too but who is trying to convince me to go to NOLA for her birthday in April.... we havent even met in person btw. So a part of me that is in denial is like itll be good, a nice getaway. But the realistic part of me is like bitch are u kidding? You're going to go on a trip with someone you havent even met in person, spending money when you may decide on the second day that you cant tolerate her or the situation? Im just.... floored. How did I dissociate through this part of my life? Why does this hunger for connection make me so indiscriminating? Fuck.... like anything looks good when you're starving and what ive been eating is starting to come up :( im depressed"

Esp new people, like dating, is a fucking minefield. I feel like I just annoy the hell out of new people and like I need to constantly tone myself down. I feel like I piss people off by asking too many questions - when I meet someone new I really feel like I need their back story and I need to work them out, I need to understand what's going on in their head. Equally, when I'm with people I already know I just feel like an annoying burden to everyone I'm around. New people seem to just be getting annoyed with me and blanking me before they even get to know me, IDK how to act 'normal' and have new people in my life."
The false hope BPD often gives is cruel,325,k74c81,58,"You ever have a couple of weeks where you're actually fairly emotionally adjusted? When suddenly it seems like you're going to get better?

it hurts so bad to be in bed with the one you love and still feel alone,325,dud972,37,it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts
It does get better. I am someone who spent nearly a whole year in bed...wasting away...barely eating > to full time employment and starting my journey to healing myself.,323,a55efm,36,"The hardest part I guess is not finding an answer that fits everyone. Because there is no magical answer. The reality is that it’s a battle everyday to stay in this happy place I’ve made for myself. For now there doesn’t have to be a drastic crazy life changing ‘thing’ you need to do. For me 4 months ago if you told me to work 5 days a week I would laugh because I know I couldn’t do it.  My goal is to get out of bed everyday. That’s it. There isn’t some crazy thing I do to improve myself. Only promising to get out of bed everyday and do my morning ‘routine’ then I find myself slowly on my way to work. Every day I get out of bed, I am winning. Winning against my bpd traits. Winning for myself and also getting paid ! . So start slowly. Slowly . One step at a time. One small thing to get to to the next day. Im sort of just rambling. But I won’t stop posting on this subreddit. I guess I want to give someone.. anyone hope. Hope that the darkest days do pass. The intensity of our inner world can be managed. Just start slowly one thing at a time. "
Nobody gives a shit about BPD.,327,a3tqgp,83,"Except a few professionals that fully understand BPD, the only people that care about BPD are other people with BPD.  My family doesn't understand or care. Friends don't care.  Nobody can grasp what it's like for us. 

It's really something you have to experience to understand.  You can get concepts from books and videos. However, without feeling the way we do, people can never really understand what it's like.  It makes it impossible to get compassion, sympathy, understanding, or validation from most people which then just makes it harder for us.  It's like living with a curse.  

The truth is, nobody really gives a fuck.  They don't have it, so it's not their problem.  The sad thing is, I can't blame them.  I'd probably be the same if I didn't have it.  You can't make someone feel what your feeling, you can only tell them.  Which, ironically, usually just pushes them away more and gives us the opposite of what we wanted.  

Our lives are a catch-22.  We desperately want validation but it seems impossible to get.  Many percieve us as manipulative and horrible people.  If only we could show them our anguish and how we so much wish we could escape and live normal lives.  Happiness is constantly within my sight but beyond my reach.

Thinking of all of you,323,7fnz8x,48,"Hi everyone,

I’m a psychotherapist who specializes in working with BPD. I’m not here to offer advice or anything of that sort but just to offer a different perspective and some encouragement.

I LOVE working with individuals with BPD. I find you to be incredibly genuine people with great hearts who are really just having an awful time. I think I like working with people with BPD because I see so many of you being very motivated to get well and I think this results in you being capable of making huge progress. I’ve seen a lot of my clients with BPD come leaps and bounds, a couple to the point that they might not even meet criteria anymore, and I give them 100% of the credit because they work so hard.

I know having BPD often feels incredibly hopeless, but I just want to say that I appreciate you and feel for you and love you. "
I’m sorry to all those I’ve hurt in ways that were hurtful and were damaging-,326,mjvcs4,30,"I was unaware that I was mindlessly reacting to my impulses and insecurities that I projected towards you & all of you. 

They say “Hurt people hurt people,” and I can’t believe I became that hurtful person that hurt you. All I wanted was for you to love me.

But I didn’t know the myths and assumptions I had about your lack of love was just my insecurities and lack of self-love.

I now know that you truly cared and loved.. but you didn’t know how to care for someone that had BPD and someone who was so lost and stuck in a dark place. 

I’m trying to move on and I’m trying my best not to project unto others my inabilities to self-regulate; self-soothe and self-love. 

I’m trying to be more effective in asking for support and help that doesn’t cross boundaries.

I’m still lost and afraid yet this adult that feels like a child navigating this world is owning up to her past wrongs. 

I reflect on our good memories & I radically accept this moment even though it isn’t what I want it to be.

I ask for your forgiveness even though you might never talk to me again- but I wish more importantly your happiness because you deserve everything good in this world. 

I’m sorry. I really am. 

And thank you for what was once.
💛

Dear me,

Set yourself free. 
Love yourself because it’s time to take care of yourself- the way you wished others would :’)

Be the best friend you never had.
It is never too late.

DAE instantly regret making decisions even though they were done in wise mind?,321,lyanzt,37,"Every time I spend money, make appointments, apply for anything, chose to do anything important, I get instant anxiety and regret.

I applied for, got approved and picked up my chest binder yesterday and only one day after I'm second guessing if it's the right size. So I've applied for another one in the next size down. The only issue is that it's through a not-for-profit and they've already supplied me one and I feel awful; like I'm stealing from someone else. BUT I actually emailed the chairman my sizing concerns before I received it and he said I can order another and just swap it out if I'm happier with the new size and someone else can have the first one. I also got anxious about putting in the right info.

Another example is that it's election time where I live and I early voted today. I kept having to read over the candidates and make sure I'm voting for who I actually want to vote for. It doesn't help that some of the party names are long and overflow into the next box to tick. This is my 6th time voting (mandatory) and I know I know how to vote but the feeling won't bugger off. As soon as I put my ballet in the box I felt a panic attack coming on and had to take a break.

I wish I could be more certain in my decision making."
"I've smoked weed everyday of my life since I was 17 and ive not smoked in 5 days and you know what, I feel great!",327,j1ludk,35,"No one numbs the pain like Mary Jane.

My puppy has been costing a fortune and I've been saving for grans funeral so moneys been tight, and smoking all those years I was so pissed thinking of all the stuff I could have done with that money rather than literally smoking it! Sleeping has been even harder than usual and obv I'm going through withdrawal but do you know how refreshing its been to not be a stoned zombie from the minute I wake up,  I've more energy than I think I've ever had and even though my bodies still craving it I feel so much better just now than I would if I was sitting stoned out my little tits numb and just ignoring my problems.

Probably the most stigmatized mental illness,323,c19c6p,120,"I remember when I found out about my diagnosis i cried myself to sleep  for days, i'm not even exaggerating, i just really did not want to think i was a borderline person. Look up BDP on youtube and one of the first results has the thumbnail of an insuferable looking woman screaming at a man, and all these videos have comments that are some variation of ''borderline people are literally the most painful people to be around''. people are comparing us to nazis. i'm open about every other illness i had, and all of my experiences, i'm quiet on being BD though. But the ''❤❤ self care ❤❤ mental illness is normal ❤❤'' crowd only cares about your illness if you have depression or anxiety, if your illness somehow makes you an unpleasant person, you are toxic and cancelled 🙂"
"This is a reply to a mystery post that I lost, that I think might help a lot of you. If you have BPD, you have not ruined anyone’s life.",325,ftkplu,56,"I accidentally refreshed and lost a post someone did about hating that she ruined everyone’s life. I wanted to reply and put that into perspective.

I realise that’s how a lot of people with BPD might feel, and maybe you have behaved terribly to certain people. But please understand that very few people would ever consider their whole life to have been ruined by one person. If these are people that love you, they will understand your condition, or at least wish they did. They continue to live their lives. You are a part of their lives, warts and all. 

So please, never make yourself feel like everyone you know has a terrible life because of you. That’s very much overstating things and puts unnecessary blame on yourself"
I(F20) sent a letter to famous clothing company when manic and it escalated to the interview today!

Days kept passing and it escalated into today, when I'm having my interview and photoshoot (as a trying if I'm eligible).

I'm leaving in a while, I'll be there at half past 12am. Oof. Wish me well.

My head just started hurting and I'm glad that my friends and my mom are so supportive to me. Too bad that my ex-fp doesn't give a sh*t. No matter, because I kept pushing her away...

[Meta] Is anyone else uncomfortable with all these 'to my BPD ex' posts?,323,bg07yi,45,"I've been on the fence about posting this for a while but I'm wondering if anyone has a problem with those types of posts too, or if I'm being too sensitive (on the BPD sub, go figure). 

I find it weird as hell when people post their letters to their BPD ex on here. It feels like they want to use us a proxy for their ex, and the purpose of posting such letters is to use us as the target of their hurt feelings and to receive validation from people they're generalizing as basically the same person as their ex. I understand the need  to vent but there are whole subreddits dedicated to people venting about their BPD exes-- posting it here, *to* us, strikes me as odd at best and malicious at worse. Not to mention it can be straight up hurtful at times and I always find myself coming the OP's profile trying to work out if it was posted by someone I've met in the past. I guess I just hate to be addressed as someone's abusive ex just because of my disorder. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Like, I don't want to assume it's a malicious thing but I just don't understand what the OP ever hopes to gain from it. If someone could help me see alternate points of view or understand the purpose of it I'd appreciate it. Thanks."
"TIL that BPD apparently isn't a mental illness, among other things [TW for ED, mentions of suicide, and just... everything about this]",320,lcfczr,88,"For some background, I'm 20F, diagnosed with BPD, MDD, anxiety, severe social phobia, and an eating disorder (First diagnosis was anorexia, developed BED in recovery, diagnosis now is EDNOS (edit: OSFED is the correct name). I am currently overweight according to BMI.)


I barely finished high school due to constant panic attacks and depressive episodes, in my last year alone I had three suicide attempts (documented by hospital). Let's just say college didn't end up well at all and I had to drop out. Currently having incredible difficulty to even complete a job interview without having a breakdown. So my psychiatrist suggested I try to apply for disability. I was extremely sceptical, since people who apply for disability due to mental health reasons are mostly dismissed as lazy freeloaders in my country, but eventually figured I had nothing to lose. 
Due to COVID, I didn't even talk to the assessing doctor, my GP just sent an application and today I got the letter back from the doctor. I didn't really expect to get approved for a disability status, so that's not what surprised me, but the assessment is a doozy.


According to him, BPD is NOT a mental illness but (and I quote) just a collection of bad habits that I learned or copied from someone else. Moreover, I clearly don't have any eating disorders as I'm in the overweight BMI range (whut?), and should clearly exercise more instead of lying in bed and crying. Yes, these are the exact words of an official document, by the way, just translated to English. Is it just me or is that really unprofessional? He didn't even mention the social phobia and anxiety, and just wrote that I don't suffer from any illnesses and am capable of working, just ""clearly unstable and hysterical"". 


So there you have it! An official doctor's statement. BPD is just a ✨bad habit✨ And in a bizarre twist of events, it turns out that I am completely healthy. Phew!


Seriously, what the actual fuck"
issues i have with online BPD spaces (cw abuse + DV),316,kbdpix,84,"bpd is not a shield for bad behavior or a license to be abusive just because you have a “favorite person.”

i don’t bother with online borderline spaces anymore because a good chunk of posts are like “i abuse my partner but i’m still valid right? i just can’t help it :(“ and the comments will inevitably absolve them.

if it makes me ableist to be the one dissenting voice then so be it! i am a “self-hating borderline.”

i’m like...putting myself in debt because of therapy and meds and whatnot, trying so hard not to ruin every relationship i have by being too emotionally needy, but these motherfuckers are like “it’s actually ableist to tell me punishing my partner with the silent treatment or hitting them is abusive.”"
The importance of identifying love over infatuation or idealisation.,318,hc4cr5,52,"So, to start with ...my ex didn't try to understand what i was feeling.

If I had a meltdown or something bad had happened, it wouldn’t be about us getting to the bottom of WHY and resolving it, being supportive, asking about what had made me sad / angry / depressed / suicidal so WE could fix it… the emphasis was always on me **just stopping** and how much it had **hurt** **him** and fixating on how terrible it had been for him to experience. If i did have an issue, it would be dismissed because i am BPD and i am ""always upset about something""

\>\_>

<\_<

\-\_\_- no.

FTR *I have no doubt that it's hard loving someone who doesn't always love themselves, but dismissive behaviour, isolating them, stonewalling, blaming and being unempathetic does nothing but amplify a lot of the things that create problems in a BPD mind and (whilst those are our responsibilities to manage and work on) it's certainly not how you get someone to open up to you... and it's DEFINITELY NOT how you treat someone you love.*

And that's the point reader. **He didn't want to understand me.** *Beware the bf who buy books on BPD but does not read them* ...he wanted *just* to be validated in his experiences of being a partner to a BPD person ...but was not interested in learning about ME as an individual or supporting me with what is effectively an every day battle we were never going to make it. I was on my own.

I hate using absolutist terms, but factually he **never** asked me *""how does it feel? what's it like? is there anything I can do to help?""* ...He wanted me to just STOP being BPD and even when it was good he wasn't interested in acknowledging the progress i made because *""but what about...""* all the bad things i did before. I felt completely unseen and utterly unlovable. The guilt was terrible. He didn't love me.

&#x200B;

Which brings me to some learnings about identifying actual love:

*As a pwBPD we tend to be attracted to people who have co-dependency issues and want to maintain and control us. Or they might have narcissistic traits and see our empathy and nurturing features as a weakness and we stick around through tonnes of gaslighting behaviour because we literally will not leave. None of these are fun to experience. Here are three types of connections and how to identify them:*

**INFATUATION is they want you, they desire you, they may respect you, but there’s no emotional depth and long-term commitment is always left vague, ambiguous.** It's fun... but often comfortable too soon. The relationship is lived in the moment and *for* the moment, so if we’re struggling at work, stressed over money, got a family problem... they probably aren’t the person you'll call or confide in.

With infatuation, conversations are shallow and awkward silences happen after the flirting has stopped because you don't know about each other and aren't instigating conversations that facilitate this learning. Now the sex has kind of ended, and the conversation has lagged. They are not consistent. You never know where you stand with them, and that guess work is what often makes this last longer than it should.

&#x200B;

**IDEALISATION is. the. worst. You can ONLY be what they think you are.** Their image of you. Based on *their* hopes. They are not happy with you as you are. They hope you change to fit their idea of who their partner should be. You’ll go from being adored one day to abhorred the next; showered with affection today to chasing validation tomorrow. It’s addicting.

They draw your emotions and feelings out of you, it seems like they care, impressing you with their compliments, their promises. But any compliments you DO receive aren’t about you, but about mirroring parts of your qualities they want for themselves. This is selfish ""love"". Prepare to be discarded when you do not live up to their *imagined* picture of you.

You will not be able to rely on this person, because you can be nothing but perfect. That doesn't mean silly things like they can't see you without make up on, but it means you cannot have any problems, it will be too much for them. No matter what you are going through, they will not put their feelings aside to put you first. Ever.

You won't know how to please them, so you'll try everything. Maintainence of all kinds, keeping the house, big sweeping gestures, planning trips, showering them with gifts, agreeing to everything in a bid to see them happy with you. But they can't be. It's not you they're unhappy with.

🎉It's themselves🎉

&#x200B;

**And then there's LOVE. If they love you, they’re not only** ***saying*** **you’re their world, but they’re** ***showing*** **you.** Maybe it starts with sex and fireworks and electricity and that little loop your heart does when their name flashes up on your phone... but then the two of you are just constantly BUILDING a future every day. They do little considerate things you didn't ask, like having your dinner ready when you get home from a long day at work. It's reaching out to their friend group to plan something because they've not had time to do it themselves. It's warming their side of the bed before yours. It's thinking of them first and they're thinking of you first. *Without keeping score.*

When they love you they’re listening to you and they want to be a better person for you, and for themselves. There's no judgement. They'll seek help for their problems and support you with yours and oh my god, they go to therapy! Not because you've asked. It's wanting time together and actioning it. It's knowing that you are stronger when a problem is solved together and also knowing that solving it *together* means you become closer because of that shared experience. There is no blame, only responsibility.

When it’s genuine love, you realise that because they’re *your person*, you know you’re theirs. There’s no guessing, no assumptions, and no hoping.

&#x200B;

I hope this has helped in some way and sorry for the long post. I hope it helps identify healthy love for you but also to recognise that **we sometimes do not also give it.** If you currently have a partner please go ask them how their day was and make them a cup of tea x

"You Are Loved, From a Person Without BPD",319,gx0o7t,40,"I just wanted to say something to all of you.

No matter what, you are loved.

You may not feel loved.

You may feel angry or vengeful.

You may feel hurt or unrecognized.

You may feel like burning bridges.

You may feel like isolating yourself, like leaving at all behind.

You may feel like ending it all. Please don’t. Whether or not you believe it, you are loved.

You don’t have to prove anything to anyone about anything. Not even to you.

You are loved. By the people who you loved and hurt. By the people who loved and hurt you.

Your diagnosis is not a death sentence.

You can have the life that you have always wanted.

I have been mourning the loss of someone with BPD who left me to start her new life almost two years ago. She hoovered me over the course of eight months, only to leave me suicidal and admitted to a behavioral center at my university.

I know what it is that you go through. I wish I could take that pain away. I stopped loving her only when she showed me that she didn’t care. I had to see it for myself. I don’t know if this is me trying to forgive her by making a public statement, because I am still very much in pain, and I wish that I had the courage to stand up to her when I had the chance.

Now I am finally in the position to start my own life, and it is looking brighter than anything I could have ever imagined. It would not have happened if my ex did not leave me behind. I would not have found myself again and found my purpose. I would have found myself empty if I had stayed. What I’m trying to say is, we are trying to survive, and to live life as best we can. Don’t put yourself in the position to believe that the world’s problems are your fault. We are all just doing our best. And that is good enough.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter/post/thing. I intend to ask more questions on this board if it is welcome. I would like to continue to understand this disease. I don’t believe we are done figuring out the cures.

God Bless, stay safe, and have a great week ❤️

EDIT: For posterity, I would like to add that I do not think my relationship with my person with BPD caused my MH issues. I will admit that it did, indeed, exacerbate them. What I will not do is place the blame on you, because you are you, and I am me. We are unique individuals with completely different life experiences. Please do not take this as an attack or somehow a Trojan horse for me to exact revenge on a bunch of Internet strangers. This is not that, I wish to understand.

Once again, I do not think my relationship with my ex caused my MH issues. In fact, I know they didn’t, because I had lived in domestic abuse for years before ever even meeting her. I would like to clarify that if anyone is concerned I am using this as a backhanded compliment, and I apologize for anyone who was hurt or affected by this. Stay safe ❤️"
"Realization: I feel bad for wanting or needing anything, so I subconsciously lean on others to make decisions based on what they want / need",319,glfgi4,21,"This is gonna be a long one, folks.

Yesterday I asked my fiance (C) about what he wanted out of our wedding photographer (aiming for October 2021) and he reply was supremely characteristic of him in general, after I posted a few different ways of how their services that we ask for could differ: ""I don't care, do whatever you want."" He is a very laid back guy who gives me this reply regularly.

Of course my instinct feelings were frustration that he ""didn't care"" and then I started falling back on my Unrealistically Logical thoughts that are founded by the belief ""I don't **need** anything other than food and water; everything else is just a want"". I don't apply that line of thinking to others, only myself, and C has actually helped me see that over time, but picking out my mental imbalance in a moment is super difficult.

I struggle with seeing all of my wants / ...*cringe* ..needs.. as a burden for others. As though I am simply in the way of everyone else's happiness.

So last night, laying in bed, struggling with other issues and also mulling over the conversation from earlier and trying to figure out why I felt that way and then it hit me:

""I am unworthy of anything good and should always put others first. If I remain apathetic towards most things, that allows others to feel safe in asserting their wants / needs in the specific situation and I don't want them to have to accommodate my feelings, etc, because that would mean I am being more of a burden and more in the way than I inherently already am""

I have a lot of different toxic thought processes that I learned from my mother, either by her modeling them or by encouraging them. I don't fully personally feel they are toxic in single moment because it's like wearing red tinted contacts that I'm not aware of. And yes, I know that I am the only one responsible for Fixing Myself, despite my struggles not being my own fault initially.

Worst part to my whole mental dynamic is that I have a hard time looking out for  and doings things for myself a lot of the time and feel bad when others do it, yet get salty when others don't. It makes no sense to be upset that someone I push away stops coming near.

I must fix this. Any advice is welcome."
"Anyone else feel like they’re fine some days, almost as though you don’t even have anything wrong with you and like you were misdiagnosed, but then you get hit shortly after?",325,ca8xyo,54,"Like right now, I feel like I’m fine. I feel like I don’t have BPD, I feel I was misdiagnosed, everything’s going amazing. But at the same time, part of me knows I’m going to get hit soon because this happens ALL the time.

Not sure if I’m quite making sense. But does anyone else feel this way?"
I just did a scary thing,322,9sq0yi,35,"And called a mental health crisis phoneline after a terrible two days of emotionally lashing out at my best friend and working myself up into a state where I was struggling to see any way out or reason to live.

Is There a Way to Turn the Empathy Off?,320,mc8e94,84,"Some people with BPD struggle with feeling empathy, but for most of us, we have more empathy than a “regular” person to the point where it often becomes painful. 

I often find myself fully empathizing with people I don’t even know (in public, online, wherever) and it drains me to the point where I’m physically exhausted. Most normal people have a regular amount of empathy that doesn’t leave them feeling drained, but for me, I can’t shut it off. I care way too much about other people who would spit all over me if given the chance. I help people that definitely would never go out of their way to help me. I can’t stop putting myself in other people’s shoes, my mind does it automatically

I feel drained, exhausted, and am worried about becoming someone’s emotional punching bag again. I feel incredibly vulnerable and helpless, and although I don’t want to stop feeling empathy all together, I need to tone it down by a lot so I no longer damage my mental and physical health 

is this even possible with BPD? it’s absolutely killing me. being too nice/caring is an absolute curse, and just causes me to get hurt by neurotypicals at the end of the day. How do I shut it off?"

"Thoughts on the infamous BPD ""overreaction"" and ""playing the victim card""",320,d8k8fn,80,"BPD that is traumatic in origin comes with a ton of unresolved trauma and all the associated aftermath lurking just beneath the surface, waiting for the faintest trigger to resurface in order to be expressed and hopefully resolved. 

We know this is part of the answer to the perplexing question many people with BPD ask themselves: Why am I constantly overreacting? 

You aren't overreacting, actually. Your reaction might well be out of proportion to the present event but it's likely that this event triggered the pain from the past of the unresolved wounds of which you may not even be aware or have detailed understanding. If this is the case, situations in which you realise you have apparently overreacted are a golden chance to make use of self-reflection skills you're hopefully learning because it can give you great insight about the wounds and the corresponding issues that require your attention. As unpleasant as they are, triggers are extremely valuable. They point the way toward healing and help us with self-awareness.
Don't dismiss your ""overreactions"" as an awkward personality flaw. 

Keeping this in mind, I had a thought I'd love to discuss with you. 
People with BPD are quite often accussed of ""playing the victim"". Sometimes others are quick to conclude that this is always ""another BPD manipulation trick"" but is this true? I think you know the answer. 
Perhaps you've been told to stop playing the victim and that only made you feel worse because you... aren't playing at all. You genuinely feel victimized, helpless, overpowered, betrayed and so on. We know that with BPD, there's always the question of ""Am I justified in feeling this emotion or am I overreacting again?""

Well, if you eventually come to realize your feelings of victimization weren't an accurate match to the present and you find yourself slipping into this feeling frequently, then this could very well be one of the unexplored and unhealed wounds from the past. It's quite likely that you are right in feeling like a victim of some form of abuse, it's just that the abuse started and ended years ago, perhaps when you were a child even, and you still haven't come to terms with that traumatic event or even traumatic time and haven't found closure, which is why those feelings keep being triggered today. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I hope that you will not allow people to shame you into devaluing and ignoring your own triggered pain just because they don't understand it. Just because your feelings are out of proportion to the present doesn't mean they are out of proportion to your past that still lives inside you through the wounds that you carry. 

The hearts of people with BPD aren't dramatic. They are badly bruised, and that is why the slightest touch sends them in deep pain when a healthy heart wouldn't even notice the touch. 

Don't despise or ignore your triggers. Listen to what they have to say. Let them identify your wounds because the wounds *can* be healed. In fact, they *must* be healed because you deserve it. You deserved help back then when you were a victim of the abuse no one helped you escape and you deserve help now that you feel you can't escape your past. But there is a way out of the dark prison chamber of pain, and what we are tempted to despise as character flaws are usually what can light the way out. 

I wish you all the best on that healing journey to freedom, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences about this."
The Barking Dog,324,bpuqsm,39,"I'm remembering a metaphor I came up with when I was hospitalized that really helped me a lot. Maybe it'll help you too. 

&#x200B;

One of my favorite DBT skills is cognitive defusion: the idea that all sorts of thoughts pop into my head all the time and I can pick and choose which ones I want to listen to. 

&#x200B;

***I, as a person, am not my thoughts. I have thoughts. I am not thoughts.*** 

&#x200B;

My brain is a barking dog. My dog barks at every single ""threat,"" whether it's real or perceived. She barks at the mailman, she barks when someone knocks on the door, she barked when someone broke into our car. Sometimes she literally barks at nothing--no sound we can hear, no one at the door, just something she thinks *might* be there. 

&#x200B;

She's doing this because she thinks she's protecting us from threats, but they're rarely actually dangerous. She's doing the best she can. She thinks she's helping and protecting us. And every time she barks, I thank her and I give her a quick pet, and say ""Ok, I've got it from here."" 

&#x200B;

My brain is a barking dog. Every time I have an anxious or paranoid thought, my brain is thinking it because it's trying to help me. It's trying to protect me or tell me a need I'm not getting or alert me that there's something wrong. But most of the time, nothing's *actually* wrong; my brain is just sensitive to the slightest stuff. And I can hear the bark, acknowledge it, thank my brain for trying to protect me, and then tell my brain ""It's ok, I've got it from here."""
turns out I never had BPD after all,324,ln21s6,64,"TL;DR - I am on the spectrum, have ASD1, it can look a lot like BPD.

CW: abuse, hate speech, bullying

I(35F) am on the spectrum. I have ASD1, formerly known as Asperger's Syndrome.

For the past 5ish years, I have been obsessively trying to recover from BPD. I was told by my therapist on many occasions, ""You have empathy, you reflect on yourself, you are in remission, you are handling things so well, you are beyond most people."" Yet still having insane problems in my relationships. I felt like I was going crazy. I felt hopeless, helpless, and like living had no point. If 40-60 hours a week of poring over articles, books, doing DBT, self esteem workbook and worksheets wasn't helping my interpersonal relationships, I felt like maybe I should just give up. I was thinking, well I'll leave the country be a performance artist, live alone, or in a commune, and have casual sex.

I started keeping notes on every person I met to try to understand what the fuck was going on. Relationships wouldn't even go beyond hanging out 2-3 times. I was alienating everyone!

Worst of all, after my victory post I wrote about me and my husband, things took a steep turn for the worse. Things went balls to the wall crazy and tested the fuck out of us and we failed at every turn.

It made no goddamn sense, why would I get a clean bill of health and then stumble so hard?

I have Asperger's and that comes across VERY weird and has cost me a lifetime of being bullied, not getting jobs, being outcasted at work, and being in therapy for ten years with a ton of success in many areas, and very poor interpersonal relationships. I would go as far as saying that BPD therapy had me constantly watching myself so much, that the interpersonal stuff was made worse by therapy.

The moment I ""came out"" to myself as autistic, my whole body relaxed. I have been masking my whole life. I have been masking even harder because of therapy. I can't make eye contact or my mind goes blank. My posture is relaxed and my body wants to do stuff all the time - STUFF I GOT REPRIMANDED FOR as a child (now I understand this is stimming, and I don't give a rat's ass if someone doesn't like it they can eat hot garbage) by my mother, who very specifically called me R\*T\*rded all. the. damn. time.

I was bullied at school, the butt of every joke. I was pushed out of a tree pretty high up. I was headbutted in the stomach. I can't even tell you the insane bullying and abuse I went through for being weird. I was called ugly 100 times a day every day for three years. I changed schools and hid under the radar a bit, but still, I was the outcast. I at least found a bunch of other misfits thank fuck.

So yeah my self esteem was in the literal toilet. And all I kept doing was failing. Spending so much energy for nothing. Nothing to show for it.

I met my husband when I was 25 and it was instant attached at the hip. I think I was not ready for that, but didn't have a voice. He was super clingy and controlling. He was better than my last one though. I gave him an ultimatum to go to therapy or it's over. He went to therapy. He finally realized he had BPD in 2016 and he's doing absolutely AMAZINGLY and extremely successful in his career, doing absolutely amazing, and he is over two years sober. He's getting into the best shape of his life, he's really just soaring in every way.

We had intermittent connection, and it was absolutely killing me (because I was failing in all of my other relationships!). We'd go weeks with small misunderstandings, distance growing rapidly, he'd turn me down on bids for connection, worried it would go bad, then we'd finally come together, we'd both be anxious, it would go bad, we'd talk in circles, just tearing our hair out, we'd get to the brink of ending it, and then when all the pressure was off, we'd come back together have passionate sex, fall in love all over again, connect deeply. And then little things would happen and it would pile up and start over.

Sounds borderline af right?

That's what we thought. That's what our therapist thought. But yet, NONE of us could fucking pinpoint what the fuck was going on.

Well it was my undiagnosed Asperger's. It was my masking. It was my constant policing and hyperfocus on ""recovery"".

I dropped the mask. I am just being myself. I am VERY monotone and come off as extremely stoic and serious, but even when I am elated my face is pretty chill. We are connecting easily. It's insane. We're cooking dinner every night. We're approaching each other with ease. We are not clinging, just living our independent lives and coming together. No more eggshells bullshit. It's actually easy to clarify things. He used to think I was doubting him, judging him, questioning him. But, with ASD1, I can't read tone, and a lot of things go over my head, and I can't process auditory information that fast, the words come out of someone's mouth and hit me like shapes and pictures, I just start hearing sounds instead of words with meaning this is the only way I can describe it, I need things repeated a lot, it seems like I'm not paying attention, but I just get lost. So he would point something out to me that he saw in someone else and I would always (and maybe will always) be like, ""Oh really? I didn't notice that."" He thought I was basically saying, ""fuck off youre wrong"" constantly. But I genuinely was asking because I genuinely cannot read read social cues or how people are feeling. In my brain, we are all islands and we will make it very obvious when we feel a type of way. The truth is, things are extremely subtle, and those things go right over my head.

It's crazy because I never thought someone ""like me"" could be autistic. I had a completely wrong idea of what autism is. I was born with a cleft lip & palate and this type of birth defect can coincide with autism. I am still coming to terms with it, but for the most part it was the missing puzzle piece I needed to fully understand myself and love my unique and beautiful self. I am working with autism therapist to help me bridge the gap.

I just wanted to write this out for any women, and people AFAB who may be at their wits end with BPD and wonder why the f they can't get better. It might be autism!

Being preyed on in this sub,320,jse6u2,45,"Cw: nsfw mention (nothing graphic)

Had a couple people come into my DMs recently who had seen me through this subreddit and attempted to manipulate me into a sexual relationship. Naturally I took screenshots of the DMs before blocking just in case. One of them even tried to argue with me that ""age is just a number"" (not that exact wording but that was the general premise of the conversation). And you know what, it is sickening to me that people are using this sub to find vulnerable victims. Mental illness is not an excuse to prey on other mentally ill people (multiple of them claiming to have BPD or BPD traits themselves). I hope no one else has had to experience people trolling this sub for victims while they were in a vulnerable spot and I'm sorry to anyone who might have.

I'm mostly mad over this. It's the internet so I'm not surprised, but I use this subreddit often enough (even if it's just lurking) that I do think of it as like a home away from home. This isn't a criticism on the sub itself but me being mad that creeps really have no shame.

Anyone else unconsciously start mimicking people they are around?,322,bipa30,42,"Anyone else unconsciously start mimicking people they are around?


There is a reason I have to be very careful who I surround myself with... because I start picking up some of their expressions—verbal and nonverbal. I will start laughing like them. Some people notice and it weirds them out. If they are judgmental, I end up being more judgmental.

I am not consciously doing this, too. It just happens. And it’s not exactly mirroring because when they are not near, I will start acting like them, too. I guess this means I have an unstable self identity? I mean I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and complex post traumatic stress disorder due to the abuse I’ve experienced since I was a child. 

But certain values of mine do not change (like being a health freak) but my personality will change. Or I guess my different parts of me are expressed depending on who I am around.


Anyone relate? Does this get better? How do I stop mimicking people or should I just accept this quirk of mine (could make me a great actress)?"

person w BPD: *breathes* someone: you're overreacting because you have bpd,313,bn6x2j,21,"Potentially triggering rant sponsored by promazine (might not make much sense because of that, sorry in advance, it acts like a sedative on me). I started typing it out as a reply to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/bmwac9/i_feel_almost_scared_to_tell_people_in_my_life/) but I figured it would mean hijacking the OP's post so I thought I'd make my own.

I've had people invalidate me multiple times because of my MH issues even when my emotions and actions would have been acceptable in a ""normal"" person (it's like being ""abnormal"" automatically makes everything I do abnormal).

My biggest fear is being abused in a romantic relationship in this way. And, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't know how to defend myself from that because all I know is invalidation and emotional abuse. And being blamed for things I haven't done (my brother once told my mum that she can't possibly be upset with *him*, that it must've been me who upset her and now she's taking it out on him! He was 39 when he said that).

Another one of my fears is that *if* I was being abused, my abuser would tell everyone I have BPD&HPD and they would side with him and blame me. That's such a good way to manipulate someone into staying silent: ""no one will believe you because you are borderline/histrionic"".  People always assume it's us who must be the abusive ones. Hell, I've been accused of being abusive when I told someone, quite respectfully and calmly, just a two-sentence comment, that commenting about how horrible borderlines are under a post made by a person with BPD talking about the stigma is not on, that that's not the place for that. She wrote a long, aggressive reply and called *me* abusive. I'm still salty over that (but happy others actually sided with me).

I just want to break down crying every time I think about how much I doubt myself and how easy it is to convince me my feelings are not valid because I'm ""crazy"". And how there are quite a lot of people out there who would, upon learning of my diagnosis, invalidate me and think I'm crazy and abusive and my feelings don't matter because I'm a monster who seeks out people with the intention of abusing them (I've literally seen people claiming we do that, that we're some evil masterminds).  And it's honestly so damaging to have such vile shit said about you or people like you. Every time I see shit like this, I want to either hurt myself or kill myself.

And the worst thing is, I internalised that.  I mean, what if I am a monster? What if I am inherently abusive and deserve to either be alone or commit suicide? I know the people making nasty comments about pwBPD/HPD don't *know me* but it still terrifies me because I have a deeply-held belief I'm an evil, worthless person. I'm sure people hate-browsing this sub are happy about that.

Also, to go off the tangent because I don't feel like making yet another post, it pisses me off I take criticism as an attack and see criticism everywhere because my mum has criticised me all my life and sometimes it's subtle, like she'd look at my stomach pointedly when I was eating a pizza (she's told me I'm fat or I should watch what I eat because I'll be fat all. my. life. My first memory of that is from when I was around 7. She keeps telling me shit like that even though she knows full well I had an ED for 7 fucking years) or, ""*this* is what you're wearing?"" (eta: she's always controlled what I wear, sometimes even going as far as to say she's not going out with me dressed *like this* when I was wearing a shirt she didn't like).

And it pisses me off that I'm ashamed that I'm ranting like this because that's just a proof I'm actually crazy.

I feel better now, though. Thanks for reading. Maybe I'll edit it once the sedative is out of my system to make it more concise.

edit: also, English is not my first language so sorry for any mistakes."

"DAE post on social media, then feel extremely self conscious and anxious about it the next day?",314,k5gzt5,31,"I can't tell if I'm just feeling genuinely confident or manic when I feel good enough to put myself out there publicly.

Suddenly I want to disappear from the world, stop posting, deactivate my social media, delete everything. I feel put under a microscope after posting, with accompanying feelings of self criticism. ""Why did you post that rap? That selfie? That deep and self vulnerable post? You seriously think anyone gives a s***? Why would you air your dirty laundry?

I’m a 29 year old woman who has been dating for years but no real long term relationships. People say I’m attractive, I have a good job, I volunteer and have hobbies, I’m a pleasant person to be around, and I’m actually pretty decent in not letting my borderline traits affect those around me (I’m more of a “quiet borderline”). I have no problem getting dates. But despite all this.. every time I truly start to like a guy back, he pulls away and slips through my fingers. Idk what energy I’m giving off to cause this and I’ve spent years obsessively trying to figure it out. But at the end of the day, all I can do is be the best version of myself that’s in my power. I’m never going to be able to overhaul the fundamental core of who I am or whatever energy I’m giving off that kills a budding relationship. My only solution is to become prettier and prettier to the point that they HAVE to love me, despite whatever flaws I have. That’s becoming especially hard as the aging process is starting. But I do some Botox and fillers, I stay in shape, probably will get hair extensions soon and even sometimes consider minor plastic surgery. I know if I throw enough money at this, I can be prettier. But I suspect deep down that better looks won’t be enough to overcome whatever weird issues I’m having with dating. In fact, some men might be turned off by my extra effort and vanity. But it seems like the only thing left to do at this point. I’ve obsessively worked on every other internal aspect of myself. And I just don’t know what else to do.. I don’t suppose anyone deals with this or has perspective?

Edit: I think I mistakenly gave off the impression that i’m basing my value on my looks. I actually feel comfortable saying that I love who I am as a person. I have my flaws like anyone else. But overall, I’m proud of the person I am and don’t think I need to drastically change anything about myself or my personality. Which is why my brain thinks outside appearance is the answer. Because if I already love who I am on the inside but it doesn’t seem to be working, then idk where else to put my effort. I’m aware that’s not the REAL answer to my dating woes. I’m just sharing what I’m fighting against in my brain."
(Repost) Should I take this video down?! I did something I've never done before. I showed my true self. My true manic or dissociated self. I'm sure non mentally ill people in my community find this disturbing but I'm tired of pretending to be happy and bubbly and care free all the time.,315,fszcze,68,
I wish I could find a person who would love me as deeply and unconditionally like I would love them.,319,dcaoib,78,"Title says it all. I would love to be someone else's fp, the way they would be mine. How beautiful it could be.

Edit: Im replying soon, havin anxiety rn ,but thank you all, love you all"
The “you’re dead to me” switch,316,c1m4nu,76,"Do you guys also have that reflex that activates when a romantic interest does something really shitty like insult you? From one second to the other I can switch from “i really like you” to “you’re dead to me” in minutes. It’s nice in terms of getting over someone, as soon as it switches I don’t really think about that person anymore and if I do it’s just “wow that was a series of shitty decisions, why did i do that for so long”. Do you also have that?"
Anyone else prepare extremely mean things to say for when shit eventually hits the fan and you’re prepared to attack?,318,9t7qrj,49,"I’m talking gut-wrenching low blows you know will hit a nerve and fuck with their self-esteem. I feel like I do this to try to protect myself.

I also may just be a horrible person lol."
I can't articulate my thoughts because I don't think in words,317,hqrsfg,42,"It's really really hard to explain, but my brain just feels like this chaotic sandstorm of colors and noises and images and feelings that don't fit together or make sense. Like my thoughts are just jumping around like crazy and I physically cannot explain it when someone asks why I'm upset. There's never just one reason, it's everything and nothing at the same time. There's always too much and I can't cope. When I go into therapy and my therapist asks me what's bothering me and how she can help me, *I don't know*. I'm just constantly afraid and angry and depressed and I don't know what to do about it, but I know she can't do anything to help me if I can't explain it. 

I just need to curl up as small as possible and sit in a small space and cry really hard all the time. I can't just keep overeating and cutting myself when I get like this but I don't know what else to do. I want to go somewhere where things are clear and okay and people don't hate me and I don't hate myself. But it's not a real place and I'll never find it."
Over sharing with people you don’t know well but not sharing enough with people close to you?,316,hg7udf,32,This is such a huge problem for me. I feel the need to blurt out every single thing about myself to new people and I can’t stop it. Once I start it’s just a snowball from there. My family doesn’t know much about me because I don’t talk to them. I guess I just want new people to know who I am before we get too close and I find out they don’t accept me.
"DAE feel no matter how much love you’ve been showered with by other people(friends and family), you don’t feel loved until your FPs(in my case my boyfriend and best friend) give you that kind of love? Or am I being selfish?",318,etptdr,33,"
I have always felt that I’ve been selfish for expecting everything only from my FPs."
Anyone else have just as much trouble with under- reacting to things as much as over-reacting?,319,c5f6o6,35,"From reading posts here and on BPDMemes, it's pretty clear that many of us overreact to minor events.  

I know I do... Like when I dropped a spoon and cried about it last week.

But when things happen that should reasonably bring on a big reaction, like finding out a friend or relative has died, or has a serious illness or accident, I'm like, ""Oh. That's too bad, I guess."". 

It's like I learned to not be hurt by things that are supposed to hurt, but I didn't learn how to deal.with minor disappointments?

Anyone else?"
DAE feel like there’s two versions of themselves arguing inside their head at all times?,316,9sduvv,64,"It always feels like there’s two of me and they are both relatively present, especially when I’m super aware of my BPD. One is highly motivated. She likes to socialize and work and be around family and pursue interests. The other is not motivated. She is suicidal, angry, upset and constantly screaming. Whenever one of them is the more dominant one, that is what I feel and how I go about life, but the other one is still present. 

Either she is encouraging me to ask for help and keep trying while the other is urging me to just end it, or she is silently judging every move that I make, waiting for me to slip up so all the motivation and work can go away. 

It’s exhausting. It makes me feel like I never know what I want from life and that I’m constantly trapped and need to flee. I guess it’s just a constant trigger of my fight or flight and I sleep so much because of it. Even on good days, there’s a nagging voice reminding me that it will go away and that I’ll have to find a way to escape or end it anyway.

Part of me thinks I should just go to a stabilization unit for a couple of days, but my dominant person rn is the positive one. It’s such a suffocating feeling."
Does anyone else struggle with being overly logical and constantly analyzing emotions and thoughts in at effort to make sense of them?,312,jdinj5,27,"I feel like I'm both overly emotional and overly logical. Obviously I get lots of emotions. Then my brain feels the need to analyze everything to make sense of everything logically since I feel like if I can understand why I'm having a feeling I can accept the feeling and then address it. But when I have no idea where the feeling came from I feel like it is much harder to deal with so I keep on overanalyzing and trying to figure it out and driving myself crazy, which makes me more emotional, which makes me want to analyze and so on..."
Why are monsters so attracted to us?,313,iozvnn,86,"The people with the lowest empathy or compassion,  people who genuinely just want to find someone who is hurt or vulnerable or scared and kick the shit out of them while at the same time calling THEM toxic seem to really love us and it's very strange.  I've jusy noticed a lot of people like to ""abubub big mean spooky borderline have trauma response behavior and that makes them toxic and me victim :'((("" while actively hurting people with bpd at the exact same time?  Whenever I see someone cry about their horrible bpd ex I just feel bad for whatever intense pain their ex was going through that they probably cannot even begin to imagine."
Distorted Appearance??,312,hwwdse,56,"Does anyone else completely struggle with having a solid image of themselves in their head? It feels as if any chance I have a moment of feeling okay about my appearance, it’s like I get a “reality check “ that makes me feel almost disfigured, or like my face is completely asymmetrical. This is very apparent whenever I take pictures of myself. I have to rely on other people for validation, or just try to trust people (which is already a challenge) whenever they say I’m good looking in some sense. Does anyone else feel this way? I just see the distorted side of myself often and I’m not sure to trust the people around me or come to terms with how I see myself in this crooked way. Maybe people with BPD or just hyper analytical of imperfections? Please let me hear your thoughts"
How do you not develop crushes on people who are nice to you?,315,hfh520,42,"Is there a word for this? I'd like to work on this.

It's happened a bunch of times to me where I develop weird, probably inappropriate, intense crushes on people who are nice to me and vaguely attractive. Does anyone have any resources for this/advice/know what this is called? Is this different from having genuine feelings for someone?

Sorry that I'm sort of taking a shot in the dark here. I haven't had access to a therapist for a few years.

(And for the positive note, I'm proud of myself for realizing that I was slipping into this cycle and pumping the brakes on it before it went too far.)"
4 months clean of self harm today!!,313,e7rdzl,23,Next goal is 6 months :D
BPD and alcohol should NEVER mix.,313,e0h7hm,112,"Binge drank last night after having been sober for a while. I drank wayyy too much and almost slept w my brother’s best friend, but didn’t only cause i got caught by my mom while fetching a condom. I also texted an ex friend saying i missed her and she responded w “yah i don’t really see you being in my life anymore. Bye.” And then i puked my brains out and cried myself to sleep. Currently at work hungover and trying not to have a mental breakdown. About 90% of the time when i drink, the night ends in shambles. Anyone else have terrible experiences with alcohol?"
I spend all day waiting to be able to go to bed.,316,c1uxnx,55,I'm so miserable I literally spend my entire day wishing for bedtime...
Suicide is so tempting but too permanent,314,j31a16,47,"I’m not going to do it but I fantasize about it too much. 
I just want everyone whose ever abandoned and hurt me to feel what I feel just momentarily. I just want to look and watch their pathetic lives not even give a damn and know that I was right along Because they don’t now so when will they ever."
Advice from a wise old owl,312,iwdshi,38,"I wanted to share this because it's really helped me over the past couple of years. Accepting that you have BPD and knowing that there's going to be dark days, but that's ok because the happy days always follow, is one of the best pieces of advice I can give. I feel like many focus on the negative symptoms of BPD, I've looked for the silver linings and believe me there are some! We know next month or the month after that we are going to be bored, restless, impulsive, desperate to change an element in our lives. It's who we are. We can still be successful people and have healthy relationships. If you want to leave your job after one month, is it really so bad just to quit and find another job? Life is short and to be stuck in a job which makes us shake with anxiety really is ridiculous when you think about it. Im so sick of people without BPD telling me 'you shouldn't do that' etc. Why shouldn't we? It's our lives, we can make decisions for ourselves. As long as we are not hurting anyone then it's ok to be you and it's ok to have BPD."
Napping feels better than sleeping at night?,317,iscn9h,24,I don't know why but my bed always feels fresher and comfier when I know I'm not supposed to be on it. I think its some kind of safety place where I can hide from my problems. Wondering if anyone else feels this way.
Does anyone else have a highly addictive personality?,313,hrn9bx,94,"I literally get addicted to anything, I’ve been addicted to cigs, juul (just quit both). I can get addicted to certain dumb things like those Vick’s vapo inhalers lmao pls tell me I’m not the only one. I can’t imagine what would happen if a hard drug fell into my lap."
Does anyone else feel like they've disscociated or depersonalized for most of their life?,312,h7i8de,47,"You know just constantly in your head, if not daydreaming about some make believe world at inappropiate times you're  somewhere not being able to enjoy a moment like being at beach because it doesn't feel real at all. Everything has always felt like a foggy haze to the point you want to cut your eyelids off the see better and brighter."
DAE find it extremely frustrating to not know if you can you can trust your own thoughts?,313,ezmsql,36,"I don't know if I am overreacting or not. I don't know if I am being objective or not. I don't know if I have a right to be angry or not. I don't know if I am standing up for myself or being unreasonable and abusive. I don't know if I am communicating my needs or being manipulative. I don't know if I am making the right decisions. I don't know if I am a good person or not. I don't know if I am explaining myself or playing the victim. I don't know if I was taking care of myself or neglecting my responsibilities. I don't know if I should stay here or not, if I am helping or making things worse.  I don't know what I want, or what I deserve. I think I had good intentions, but I just don't know. 

I'm. just. so. confused."
DAE mentally feel younger?,314,e60s52,139,"it’s so weird but i don’t feel like an actual adult. i’m turning 22 soon and i just.. don’t feel that age. i legit feel like i’m 17 years old?? why?? does this happen to anyone else?? am i just a weirdo? lmaooo

edit: i’m not childish or anything like that. i’ve always been super mature(haha we love trauma) so maybe that’s why. it’s just more of like i don’t feel like an adult. there’s all these people who are accomplishing so much and i just feel years behind them. even though i’m in college and everything. i’m stuck and i don’t know how to get unstuck.

edit: maybe we all just had really big expectations for life or something lmao. like maybe we just expected to feel different when we were older. not the same/worse. i don’t know what it is but i’m obsessing over it atm hahaha."
Does anyone else get extremely agitated by people who do things the wrong way and think there’s nothing wrong with it?,314,dmyqxk,40,"I’m wondering if this is a thing that happens to others, but I work at a grocery store and I see customers do things that just get under my skin to an extremely high level and makes me very angry. I just wish people would take into consideration others around them and their feelings, but I guess hoping for people to do things like that is a lost cause. It effects my day severely because the entire day I’m filled with rage but I’m too afraid people will get mad if I lash out, so I keep it all in which makes it worse. 

I’m so sick of feeling like this."
The genuine nicest thing that has even been said to me,316,c9so9x,35,"So my friend from school lives with me and he has just said this to me “I have been researching and listening to podcasts to try to understand your condition because I find you truly interesting and incredible and I cannot even begin to comprehend how you begin to deal with your borderline everyday. You know what and where your faults are and you work hard to fix them and I have a lot of time for that.”

I have never ever felt so emotional at someone saying something like this to me. Imagine someone loving you platonically so much to take the time to learn to understand you regardless of how many times you split on him and enter rage episodes around him. I feel so whole right now."
DAE obsessively + immediately respond to people they feel ignored by and then feel too exhausted to reply to people who are more consistent?,309,fwfusi,17,"I'm feeling absolutely shattered emotionally by quarantine. I have some online friends who are pretty considerate and active about responding to me / reaching out to me and 90% of the time I feel too exhausted to reply to them. On the flip side, people who have been sparse/uncaring in their replies to me, but who I thought I was close to, I have been OBSESSIVELY responding to / texting. One of my consistent friends I think (rightly) has gotten tired of my bad replies and didn't reply to my very late texts today despite seeing them, and now I'm obsessively waiting for her response too. I somehow get minimal joy from getting texts from people who are being considerate, even if I care about them, but I'm addicted to texts from people I think are losing interest in me. I feel the same way about reaching out for support when I'm doing badly - if someone has shown me relatively unconditional support their replies have much less impact on improving my mood, whereas if someone who is a risk to reach out to responds positively I get massive endorphins. Anyone else???"
DAE sometimes have moments where you trip out realizing you're actually a real person?,315,e5gic4,46,This happens a lot when I smoke weed but I experience it sober too. I get really self-conscious about myself and anxious about the things I've done in the past. Things which aren't even really bad either. It's very exhausting.
I survived an outburst!,312,e26c0e,28,"Today at work something set me off and I was all ready to go and cry, but instead I went to my corner, thought to myself “bro is this justified? or is this your BPD?” bro (myself) answered: “u right. bpd 100%” and I calmed down :) and I went and apologized to the one coworker that I semi snapped at.

sorry to suck my own dick but I’m honestly kinda proud of myself lol"
Does anyone else have severe issues with intimacy but have a high sex drive ?,313,d3yzqi,61,"I have bpd and I really, have a serious fear of intimacy with other people. Like I love sex but at the same time I feel like I am not a sexual being . I have gone years at a time without sex, but I masturbate like 4-10( modest estimate ) times a week. Like I really want to have sex but when time has come to finally “do the deed” I get cold feet and can’t do it idk if it’s from past trauma or what . If anyone else experienced this pls let’s chat."
DAE anyone experience selective mutism when their mood take a spiral?,313,c6czui,42,"Probably the most common way I express distress is by becoming mute. When my anxiety gets so high and I feel incapable of expressing it without having a tantrum, I feel like my vocal folds vanish from my body. Weirdly enough I regain the ability to laugh and sing before communicate before the ability to talk. If I am lucky, I can use my phone to text my thoughts. But it’s as if I just lose my ability to communicate and I am at risk of becoming totally frozen."
"I hate myself for hating happy, healthy people",311,ffiiy9,30,"I hate that I hate when I see happy people, especially if they're friends or family or honestly even peers.

I went to a party at my best friend's house last night and I looked happy like I was having fun. You can put me in any social situation and I can adapt and appear like I belong. But really, I was miserable, I felt alone and just plan sad as I saw my friend's happy, well adjusted friends with their happy normal SOs walk in. Everyone there was ""where they should be"" in life. Decent paying jobs, starting families, healthy, talking about buying houses. They we're all in stable relationships. They seemed to treat the people they love with respect. They can sit with obstacles and not overreact or be dramatic. They were so...normal. 

Then there was me. On the outside, laughing, pretending to be happy and stable. I'm educated, cleanup well and people who don't know me would think I'm outgoing, kind and fun. They probably would have no doubts that I'm also in a long-term relationship with a stable job. And last night, I could of been one of them. 

But that's all a facade. I'm so fucking fake. I'm lonely. Unlovable. Ugly. Dirty. Used. Beaten. Scared. Disgusting. Miserable. Reclusive. Reckless. Dangerously impulsive. Boring. Hallow. Disordered. My emotions have hurt people cause I'm a manipulative liar and a cold-hearted bitch.

And yet I'm nothing without other people's validation. But because I'm so sick, I feel always alone.

I don't have a stable job. I'm on government assistance. I need a pharmacy's shelf worth of meds. I sit in a group for 9 hours each week, where I need to be taught ""skills"" all normal functioning adults already have. 

Unlike the happy and healthy people I saw last night, I'm a mess. And worst of all, I hate them. I hate that I hate them. I'm so jealous. And I feel like a world-class cunt cause of it.

I deserve it. I deserve to feel like such shit about myself because of it. I deserve all the bad that's happened to me. I want to do something stupid and get hurt or have someone hurt me again.

I'm not really looking for advice, this is more a venting post. Just seeking some solidarity, cause fuck."
DAE have BPD and social anxiety?,312,dly4fy,79,"I feel so lonely most of the time because I’m really bad at making friends and I don’t have a really great self esteem so I think no one will like me. The only person I can get close to is the person I’m dating. So if I don’t have that person, I’m alone most of the time. And I avoid making friends because I’m scared"
DAE feel like you are everyone's therapist?,308,de5mow,46,"You become people's therapist. You listen and absorb all of their life problems. That way you can maintain your friendship/relationship so that they don't leave you but the truth is, they don't really care about you and you start of beat yourself up for it."
DAE feel like they can never manage to say what they mean?,310,bj9vet,60,"The words just don’t come out right. In fact, sometimes they don’t come at all because you know what word you’re thinking of, you just can’t say it or any synonyms. 

Or perhaps you over explain and realize you sound like an ass? Under explain and get frustrated when others can’t just make simple inferences and understand?

Forget every thing someone says that might help you become better friends but remember everything that’ll help you hold a grudge? 

Forget everything in general during a conversation?"
"I feel like instead of ‘getting better’, I am just getting better at faking/hiding my misery.",309,mbh552,15,"On the outside it looks like I’ve made so much progress, but on the inside it feels just as terrible. I feel like I am constantly being fake, and I am so tired..

I am having a lot of issues in my relationship right now, and I can’t even tell if I’m splitting or truly do not want to be with my partner. BPD sucks."
DAE: Get really arrogant and nasty thoughts?,311,hnvvtj,41,"Sometimes when my boyfriend wrongs me I think such mean things about him to the point of hating him. I know this has to do with splitting but sometimes it’s just so nasty. 

I’ve thought things like I’m way too pretty for him to be treating me less than. Sometimes I feel like I’m way too good for him, like he should be kissing the ground I walk on or that he should be grateful I give him the time of day...

It’s terrible thinking, I’m not a nasty person... I love him and I love people... I don’t like thinking like this and I’ve never expressed this to him or said anything related to hurt his feelings, sometimes I just think these things when he does something that hurts or upsets me... ):"
Here's why you shouldn't burn yourself,307,m17mdb,79,"So I made a post here a few days ago asking if anyone else burns themselves. I'm glad I didn't get many responses. I finally had to go to the hospital for my burns yesterday, I was there alone for 7 hours and it turned out that I'm infected from wrist to elbow on both arms. I have to go back to the hospital  in a week and a half, and if my burns aren't significantly better, I need plastic surgery. 

Dressing these things takes a solid 15 mins of struggle, twice a day. And when you're doing it in the hopes of avoiding plastic surgery, it's intense. 

Plus I'm obviously in a huge amount of pain, I can barely move my arms.  0/10, would not recommend."
